However the K2000 & K2500 have a feature that is *better* than tuning tables
if you are willing to program it a bit and use MAX as your controller.

I use MIDI controller 20 into a sample and hold that samples per voice on
note on. That controller is used to modulate pitch over one semitone
giving 128 steps per semitone. I use MAX to send a MIDI controller 20
as a fine tuning before each note on.

This scheme allows me to use 1536 pitches per octave over the entire range
of the machine at any time and not be limited to any fixed set of pitches.
It also allows polyphonic microtonality on a single MIDI channel which you
cannot do if you are using pitch bend since pitch bend is monophonic per
channel.

In order to use this scheme you must edit your K2000 patches to use one
of the FUNs as a sample and hold and use that as a pitch modulator.

I think this makes the K2000 the BEST synth of all for microtonality.
