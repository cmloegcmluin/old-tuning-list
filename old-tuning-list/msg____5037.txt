Subject: mapping spectra

From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu>

A recent thread reads:

" Each chemical element is uniquely identifiable in the 
electromagnetic spectrum by its special set of unique frequencies.  
These frequency sets interact to produce more complexly unique 
cycle frequencies, which are unheard by human ear but which 
resonate just as do humanly hearable musical chords or dissonances."

to which Gary M. replied...

   Interesting...  It would be curious to hear the chords produced by 
the absorption patterns of various chemical elements and 
compounds, after transposing them down some enormous number of 
octaves. Were I to guess though, it would be little more than a 
curiosity.  I personally doubt if they would have any particularly 
significant meaning to our ears.  The two physical/physiological 
mechanisms are far too unrelated for there to be much correlation.  

A few years ago, Tom Staley and I wrote an article called "Sounds of 
Crystals" in Experimental Musical Instruments (EMI) that did 
something very similar (ref. below). We looked at x-ray diffraction 
patterns (spectra) and mapped them into the audio spectra. Many of 
the resulting sounds were exceedingly complex (*very* many 
nonharmonic partials), but there were some real standouts. One of 
our favorites was the sound of the morphine crystal, which we used 
for a piece titled "Duet for Morphine and Crystal" that appeared in 
the EMI compilation cassette that year. 

Though it can be an interesting way of generating "new" sounds, I 
would agree with Gary's assessment that there is nothing inherently 
significant about the sounds - for instance - the effects of listening to 
the morphine derived sounds in no way have the same effects as 
consumption of the material itself. 

In the same issue of EMI, there is also an article by Susan Alejander 
called DNA tunings that uses data from DNA sequences to generate 
interesting tunings that she then plays on a synth.
