There is one thing about the diatonic and pseudo-diatonic scales I
mentioned which seems important but is not shared by other similar
scales such as 19 out of 22: in the scales I mentioned, a given
consonant interval is always approximated by the same number of scale
steps. This seems like an important grammatical feature without which
the sense of the scale as a fixed melodic basis could be very difficult
for a composer to convey. Stronger requirements such as Rothenberg
propriety (which requires that a given number of scale steps always
subtends an interval smaller than the smallest interval subtended by
that number plus 1 scale steps) seem less useful as they exclude such
common scales (such as the Pythagorean diatonic) from consideration.
