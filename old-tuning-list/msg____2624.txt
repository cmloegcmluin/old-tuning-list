Subject: Re:Proteus Tuning

From: Flynn Cohen <fcohen@dcolarts.demon.co.uk>

the Proteus E-MU Master Performance System Synthesizers we have at my college 
have the very unfortunate disadvantage of tunability to only 
64-divisions-per-semitone. This basically means that I have to calculate my 
'cents' approximations of whole-number ratios to even more compromised figures 
--e.g., the ratio of 7/4 can be represented as 969 cents, or 31 cents flat of a 
theoretical tempered minor seventh; the proteus will then read that discrepancy 
as 20/64ths of a semitone, etc. This process is utterly tedious, as well as 
being insufficient in terms of deriving natural intervals (i.e., I  am forced 
to tune by maths, rather than by ear).
Do the Proteus' that you lot are using really tune in cents? How recent is your 
equipment? etc., etc. I think I would do anything to get away from tuning the 
way I do now (except for buying my own equipment, of course).
