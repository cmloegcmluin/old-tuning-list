Subject: Re: Lingua Franca Notation

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I hope this thread continues to be of interest to the list and I hope, 
too, that we can proceed in a fashion that is without a shadow of a doubt 
flameless.  This slow prelude to my comments follows a year of internet 
experiences which seem to demonstrate a propensity for misunderstanding 
in using the medium.

Perhaps it is the notation that is at fault, since it symbolizes intent.  
Maybe we will eventually communicate more fully in music. :)

That said, I think it's time to dig up an old enthmusicology chestnut:  
There are 2 kinds of notation - prescriptive and descriptive.  For 
example, when a composer writes things for him- or herself that only he 
or she fully comprehends, that is dscriptive (of the music).  To be 
prescrptive is to notate for others to enact the music.  Ben's notation 
leans to heavily back to descriptive based on past experiences with his 
music.  No Ben was not happy with the "slow performance" of his Hockett 
for bassoon and tuba.  The tubist could only go so fast with his 
quartertone instrument making all the pitch adjustments, following an 
incredible amount of study to calculate the pitches "perscribed."

Maybe this is where theory breaks away from practice.  Please give me the 
information that the computer is privy too if it is performance you 
want.  If you want me to translate from Hertz, then you are providing a 
serious impediment before an eventual performance.

I like the idea of a Lingua Franc, especially since I have always 
believed that all music is microtonal from a cross-cultural 
perspective.  No, one should change the notation for Charles Ives, for 
example, because Ives wanted flats "flatter" and sharps "sharper" (his own 
directions fully corraborated by Kirckpatrick and in several palces by Ives).

However I have to change Carrillo's number notation to cents in order to 
achieve performances (except for the 96-tone harp which does well in 
int).  MicroMay '97 will feature a double choir work of Andrea Gabrieli 
which I transcribed from neumes.  Is this permissible in order to achieve 
performance?

Performances, if it is  deemed important for the future of microtonal 
music (and just intonation composers never fail to include themselves as 
"microtonalists" when a possible performance of their works is involved), 
need every advantage to suceed.  Frankly, they are endangered in our 
culture.  It has been most helpful that the word "microtonal" has been 
adopted so readily in the past 5 years.  Similarly, it would be terrrific 
if today and tomorrow's players could count on understanding how to read 
and perform any and all tunings.  Cents makes the most sense.
