Other ratios indeed have this property: 3:1, 5:1, 6:1, etc.

Two notes of wavelength 1 and 3 combine to form a wavelength of 3.

This is only true assuming the notes are exactly in phase. Changing the
phase won't change the sound of the interval. If they are in phase,
though, you can replace "power-of-two" with "integer multiple" and the
statement is still true. So 3:1, 5:1, 6:1, etc. are just as good as 2:1,
4:1, 8:1, etc.


Sorry people, there is no theoretical justification for octave
equivalence. Maybe my comments above explain why many who feel that
octave equivalence is brainwashing try to replace it with 3:1
equivalence. I believe, though, that octave equivalence is an innate,
inborn phenomenon, and I would be interested to know if that claim about
the cochlea going around once per octave is true.
