Subject: spectral composers/pimping for Modernism :-)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

While Brian McLaren provided you with some description of his
interests with regard to the French "spectral" school [I'd tend to
add some of Jean-Baptiste Barriere's electroacoustic work as well
as Kaija Saariaho's in this regard], he neglected or was unable to
provide you with the necessary info that might make it possible for
you to head down to Tower or your local University library [if you're
one of those horrible persons who consorts with Satan ;-) ] or
wherever. In this case, Brian and I share some similar interests in
terms of their work; I wandered over to the rack and plucked a couple
of discs [maybe I'll run some of the Hurel this Sunday - hmmm....]
which
you might wish to look for:

For Murail:
Murail:Time and Again, Gondwana, Desintegrations (Salabert SCD8902)
L'Attente/Baroque Mystique (Accord 204672)
Allegories/Vues Aeriennes (Accord 200842)

P. Hurel (Ades 204562) - Includes Six Miniatures en Trompe, Lecon

Denis Cohen (Ades 203652) - Includes Transmutations, Jeux, Sogna Deda

I might also suggest the Magnus Lindberg disc from the same series
(Ades 203582). While Lindberg's sense of colour certainly benefits
from his tenure in Paris in the midst of Murail and Cohen et. al., he may
be tainted in Mr. McLaren's view by his association with the New Complexity.
What interests me about the work on this disc is that it's recent and reflects
(I think) a move away from some features of tNC and toward some of the
spectral effects that Brian praises in Hurel and Cohen. The essential
restlessness
of the work remains, and might be enough to interfere with your listening
experience if you're afflicted with this particular strain of auditory
prejudice.

With regards,
Gregory

P.S.  In the midst of Brian's last message (you know the one), he managed to add
one little message which seems to have been pretty amusing to those of you who
know me - the implication that I'm somehow involved in the wholesale support
of High European Modernism as a zero-sum game. Those of you who might wish to
view the extent of my ah...Modernist crimes as a radio programmer are welcome
to point your web browsers at

http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/RTQE.html

and peruse the full measure of my heinous crimes - at least the 1996 measure.
I just didn't feel like reformatting the previous 8 or so years. If you could
imagine your own work in the midst of the listings you discover there [which,
had in included more than the year to date, have included several names you'd
no doubt recognize - Alves, Curtin, Lyon, et. al], get in touch; in principle,
the only work that I've told my audience I won't play is my own.

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
