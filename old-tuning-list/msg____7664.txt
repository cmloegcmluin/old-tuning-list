The Transtrem bends all the strings by the same amount by having a 
variable string length and angle behind the roller bridge pieces. 
If you tuned the guitar to an open just major chord, for instance, you 
could play in five different keys with the same just tuning. Its not a very 
flexible way to play or compose, but we take what we can get. I overstated 
by saying "a great microtonal instrument". Perhaps I should have said
"a fun guitar to fool around with".

BTW, I like Ken Wauchope's suggestion that we use the term "Allotonality" 
(alternative (allos=other) to describe the practice of list members. See 
Ken's page at
