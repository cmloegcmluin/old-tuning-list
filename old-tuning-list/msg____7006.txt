Odd limit of the interval, sorry.

The superparticulars are just all the intervals between adjacent members of
the series.  You're supposed to be able to detune a 3/2 more than an 13/12,
since there's less low-numbered ratios near the 3/2 to get confussed with,
right?  That's idea A.  It suggests that if you've got a certain amount of
tempering to do, you should do it more on the low identities.

Yet the high identities rely on the low ones for context in music.  High
identities work in a tonality, and its the lower identities that play the
bigger role in establishing tonality.  That's idea B.  It's the cons to
tempering the lower identities more.  While they alone can stand more
tempering than the higher identities, how well the higher identities to
work depends on the strength of the lower ones.

I see I made a mistake as to what your criteria were for the two candidate
lists.  I don't have the charts, but I didn't think that 22, 26, and 27
were as good at the 5-limit as 12...

>>Can you suggest a way to make the paper less confusing on this point?

Yes.

Instead of...

"if we wish to move to the 7-limit without decreasing the overall level of
accuracy from that of 12-equal at the 5-limit"

Say...

"if we want our new tuning to approximate the 7-limit at least as well as
12-equal approximates the 5-limit"

Instead of...

"but now only two are still more accurate than 5-limit 12-equal"

Say...

"but now only two are still better at the 7-limit than 12 equal is at the
5-limit."

>>First of all, it's an interval, not a pitch.

This time my use of pitch is just fine.  The intervals are the aug 4th and
the dim 5th.  I meant that, starting the two intervals on the same bottom
pitch, the "two" upper pitches are the same.

>>Secondly, the augmented fourth and diminished fifth _sound_ different in

I agree.  Playing Jazz got me to understand enharmonics in 12, especially
the difference between the aug 4 and the dim 5.  I can see the reason why
someone might prefer to use enharmonics and proper spellings of intervals
for certain work in 12.  I just don't prefer using them for the type of
work I do in 12.

>>}Why you consider it a type of fifth in your

You mean scale degrees, not steps?

If my scale is, in 12...

C  C#  E  F#  G#  B  C

..then the tritone is the 4th degree.

>>I did provide such a definition -- "step" means a step in the scale, not a

>>concept is meaningless.

I'm with you on the need for a generalized diatonic scale, but I missed the
definition.  I don't see why a fifth is ever anything but the fifth degree
of a scale.  The tritone isn't part of the "unaltered diatonic" scale, so I
can't see how it can be a type of 5th or 4th degree in that scale.

>>Wow, I thought my definition was fine. It certainly seems robust to me. How
>>would you suggest I improve it? Perhaps by spelling out every single
interval
>>occuring in each of the "generalized diatonic" scales?

Maybe.

How would you define diatonic?

How do you define dissonace, as in "characteristic dissonance", at a given
odd limit?  An interval whose ratio involves odd numbers (after factors of
two are taken out) bigger than the limit?

You can't just type the numbers in by hand?  I'm sure you can turn off the
auto-numbering with a short spelunk thru the preferences thingy.  I hate
Word to death, and I just removed it from my computer, or I'd tell you how
exactly.

I'll keep my eyes peeled.

Unfortunately, no.

Oh, maybe so.  At the cost of a pitch set twice the size of Partch's
(roughly, but the pitch set used varies from work to work).

None in particular.  That was the point.

Thanks for work.  This seems quite a bit more elegant to me.  Truth be
told, elegant was what I was trying to avoid.  I said that I left out the
inversions to reveal structure in the scale.  Maybe this was misleading.  I
didn't pick the approximations as a scale.  I was just trying to show what
you might wind up hearing if you're not careful.
