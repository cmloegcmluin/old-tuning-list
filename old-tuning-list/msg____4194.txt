Subject: Microtonal concert

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Bonnie Wright has informed me that the Spruce Street Forum,
301 Spruce Street, San Diego, CA, will host a weekend of
Improvisational music next weekend.

The UCSD Improvisational Quartet of Patrick O'Keefe, Jason Stanyck, 
Scott Walton and Glen Whitehead will be performing with special guest 
artist George Lewis on Friday, December 6, 1996 at 8 PM.  This
performance will not be microtonal, but will definitely worth 
attending. 

The Saturday, December 7, 1996, performance by the Sonic Arts Ensemble 
of Jonathan Glasier, Brian McLaren and Bill Wesley will definitely be
xenharmonic. As the announcement says, "This microtonal music program 
will consist of directed improvisation where every piece uses a 
different scale." This performance will also be at 8 PM.

Call (619) 295-0301 for more information.
