Java is an evolving environment. Today's Java API only plays mono, 8K AU
files. The Java sound API has been proposed but not released. It is supposed
to be released sometime after JDK 1.2. The current JDK is at version 1.1. It
takes another year or so for each new version of the JDK to be incorporated
into the most popular browsers.

You can read more about the Java Sound API from the following URL. I believe
that it will handle most of your sound card tuning needs.
