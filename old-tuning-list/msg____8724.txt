   (Predictable...)

   Well Mr. Lucy, I am at a lack to think of *ANY* concept of consonance in
which a harmonic major second (two steps up the circle of fifths), would be
more consonant than a harmonic major third (four steps up the circle).  Nor
can I think of any reasoning whereby a major sixth would be regarded as
anything even close to 33% more consonant than a major third.

   Also, this says nothing of the distinction between 81:64 and 5:4, when the
consonance difference between the two has been a major historical driving
force in musical-tuning evolution.
