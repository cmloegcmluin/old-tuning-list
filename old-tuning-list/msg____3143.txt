Subject: mIRC channel

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

I had another idea. We could have a IRC channel! Live chat with other
musicians! I recommend #Tuning on DalNet. #Tuning because I find the name to
be appropriate, and DalNet because the network enables us to 'register' the
channel. Dont email me on this topic, join the channel! If it is not crowded
during the first hours/days, stay connected for all your session anyway,
people will come eventually.
