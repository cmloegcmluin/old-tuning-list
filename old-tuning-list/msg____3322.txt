   A=440 is the A directly below the center line of the treble staff.  

   Several folks have recommended the (roughly 1/6-tone) lower C=512 tuning.
One such effort I recall was spearheaded about 8 years ago by by Lyndon LaRouche
and a fairly illustrious crew of opera stars.  I don't know what ever came of
that, but they attempted to get the Italian Parliament to legislate that
absolute pitch reference.  

   Most people don't find a lot of concern over absolute pitch though, and a lot
of people who develop sensitivity to absolute pitch end up regretting it.  When
orchestras retune themselves to other references (e.g., the Vienna
Philharmonic's favorite A=448 (God only knows what possessed ol' Herbie to pull
a stunt like that!)), it drives them bandanas!
