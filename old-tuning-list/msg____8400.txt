Hello Erich, Everyone,

I'm happy to anounce I'm now the  owner
of a Yamaha PSR-530, XG compatible keyboard. It's limited
to twelve note scales (-63 to +64), 1200/768 (100cent/64) resolution.
The range and number of tweakable parameters is terrific, making it
possible to obtain very professional results. Comes with a built
in computer interface (Mac & PC). Also, a 5-octave keyboard (with one
split point), pitch-wheel, & decent sounding 12 Watt stereo speaker
system. 

You do however have to use a computer to do any tweaking, and turn
off local control, run the keyboard through a MIDI thru (hardware or
software,
I use the little freeware "OMS thru" on my PowerMac) and back into the
PSR-530.
A bargain at the equivalent of $500.

Actually, I believe Yamaha has fudged the terminology in the 
manual for the PSR-530. The MIDI Master tuning can in fact be  tuned
-100 cent to -100 cent. But for microtonal tuning ("Scale Tuning" in
Yamaha speak), they could potentially confuse users with little
microtonal technical knowledge, because this is what they say :

"...alows each individual note of the octave to be tuned over the 
range from -64 to +64 cents in 1 -cent increments (1 cent = 1/100th
of a semitone)."

These are actually 64ths of a semitone, aren't they ?

>the sysex messages are vendor specific and therefore different.
Yup, from what I've seen, Roland GS sysex microtuning messages
consist of a single 22-byte message, while the Yamaha PSR's XG
apparently requires 12 seperate 9-byte messages (one for each note).
This is how I do it. I'm waiting for clarification on some things
from Yamaha.

>general midi has master channel tune in increments of
>100/8192 cents (much finer)
>so it is possible to tune each channel separately.
Thanks for mentioning this possibility, Erich, it completely escaped my 
attention. Could someone clarify : There is a MIDI MULTIPART "Detune" 
parameter. It says : "-12.8..+12.7[Hz]" . So, what is the size of the 
increments ? And does anyone here know how to write the Sysex message ?
The manual gives two "High-Mid-Low" Addresses, and says :
"1st bit3..0-> bit7..4" & "2nd bit3..0-> bit3..0"

There is also the RPN Parameter : "Fine Tune", which says 
"[00H,00H] - [40H,00H] - [7FH,7FH]", 
"(-8192*100/8192) - 0 - (+8192*100/8192)"
Same questions, what size the increments, and how goes the Sysex ?
If it's 0 to 8192, then I can figure out the Hex.

Just using a keyboard with atleast one split point, it is possible to
fool around with many equal temperaments. I've been giving it a bit of
thought and it should handle equal temps of upto 24 notes per octave.
All it entails is transposing both left & right sides to the same
"octave" range,
then tuning the both parts to the odd numbered pitches of an ET, and
shifting
the channel master tune so the pitches on the right hand become the even
numbered pitches of the scale. 

I guess some of you do this already. Anyway, it's safer than
impersonating Penn & Teller.It's more flexible than tuning
individual channels, since you retain more polyphony.

>since a midi keyboard (or any other midi instrument)

Here we go again ! Is this a Power Mac application or Windows ? 
If it's Windows, can someone point to a Power Mac thingy for
rechannelizing  ?

Ciao,
