Subject: forum CD, Robair

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Yes, they're starting to trickle in...I have 2 DAT's for the forum CD, 
and I hope the rest are following soon...my address is Box 150271 
Lakewood, Colorado 80215  (303-477-3268)...please send a cassette along 
too, so I can listen to your pieces and get an order together for the 
tunes (Stephen, can you send one...?).
    Also, was looking through my old Guitar Player mags, and found a 
great article by Gino Robair on "Tuning Myths" in the July 1989 
issue...if anyone has his address, I'd like to get in touch...see 
you...Hstick
