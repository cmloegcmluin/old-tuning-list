   I know what you mean about it not tying you to one machine.  In two very
different ways though, it does tie you to one machine.  
1.  It pretty much ties you to one timbre since 12 (presumably you'd do all 12
    pitch classes) of your 16 channels will be tied up to play a single 
    timbre.  Now I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with composing
    in one or two timbres of course, but that is a limitation, be it desirable 
    or not.  
2.  As far as I can tell from the MIDI spec, there is no standard amount of 
    pitch deflection that a give amount of change in pitch-wheel value should
    produce.  I would not be surprised if there is a defacto standard, perhaps
    whatever the DX-7 does or something to that effect.  Similarly, I know of 
    no guarantee that all instruments will bend pitch consistently with each
    other.  By that I mean that, best I can tell from the MIDI spec alone at
    least, some instruments could bend pitch in proportion to frequency, some
    in proportion to log frequency, and some in proportion to period, if they
    so desire.  Again, there may be a defacto standard that will save you.  

   Perhaps somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.
