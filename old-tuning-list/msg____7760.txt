Subject: Fletcher on Sethares: TTSS "should be studied by all lecturers i

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Dear All,  

at the risk of making Bill Sethares blush, here is a recent review 
by Neville Fletcher (co-author of "The Physics of Musical 
Instruments") of Bill's recent book : 

Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale
by William A. Sethares
Springer-Verlag, London 1998
ISBN 3-540-76173-X
345 pp. plus CD. 

(sorry, I left the review reference at home, but can post it if 
anyone wants to know - it's in an Australian Journal).

***********BEGIN REVIEW***********

To most people, the 12-note scale of the piano keyboard, and with it
the hierarchy of consonant intervals =BE the octave, fifth, fourth and
third =BE  is the basis of all music.  Some may be aware that the modern
system of equal temperament, in which all semitone intervals have
precisely the same frequency ratio, is a compromise that sacrifices
the purity of tuning of the consonant intervals (except that of the
octave) for the ability to play equally in all keys, but that is about
where most knowledge stops.

 But what is the basis of these musical principles?  Take the octave,
 for example.  Its importance as a concord derives from the fact that
 ordinary Western musical instruments have harmonic spectra, in which
 the overtone frequencies are integral multiples of that of the
 fundamental.  If two notes an octave apart (frequency ratio 2:1) are
 sounded simultaneously, then many of the overtones coincide and the
 result is a pleasant smooth sound, while any mistuning leads to
 unpleasant beats and tonal roughness.  But what if the individual
 notes have inharmonic spectra?  A recorded example shows that if the
 spectra of the two notes are stretched, then the "octave" must be
 similarly stretched to give a concordant sound.  It is also possible
 to divide either the genuine 2:1 octave or a stretched octave into a
 number of equal "semitones" other than 12 =BE both 11-note and 10-note
 divisions can sound very pleasant =BE provided that the overtone
 spectra of the component notes are adjusted appropriately.  And this
 is despite the fact that the traditional "concords" have now
 disappeared!

 Non-Western musical traditions based upon non-harmonic percussion
 instruments, such as the  gamelan of Indonesia, have faced similar
 problems and have developed pleasant-sounding scales with 5 or 7
 notes in a slightly stretched octave, but with tunings very different
 from simply playing selected notes on a piano.

 This excellent book, written by a musically minded electrical
 engineer and computer scientist, examines the basis of our whole
 concept of melody and harmony and presents compelling recorded
 demonstrations using computer-synthesised sounds.  The presentation
 requires no mathematical background, though the relevant mathematics
 and computer programs are given concisely in a series of appendixes
 for those who want to follow them further.  As well as stretched
 octaves, stretched spectra and non-12-tone scales, the author shows
 in detail how to construct a synthetic instrument spectrum to match
 an arbitrary scale, and conversely how to design a scale to fit a
 given instrument spectrum.  There is a detailed treatment of the
 gamelan, and then, as a virtuoso exercise, he designs a scale and
 presents musical examples to match the sounds of a small bell, a
 piece of resonant stone, and the pattern of an x-ray diffraction
 spectrum!    He also shows how a computer can adaptively tune the
 notes of a scale so that the result is concordant irrespective of key
 changes =BE an aim that is only imperfectly fulfilled by equal
 temperament and that leads to disaster in just intonation =BE and
 outlines a treatment of music theory for an equal-tempered 10-tone
 scale.

 The writing throughout is admirably clear and straightforward, the
 book production is up to Springer's usual high standards, and the
 recorded passages on the CD, which comprise both short examples and
 longer compositions in unusual scales on peculiar synthetic
 instruments, admirably illustrate the points made in the text.  They
 also demonstrate that the author is a very competent and persuasive
 composer in this new idiom.

 This book, which is destined to become a classic, is essential
 reading for anyone concerned with computer music, or with the study
 of non-Western music.  It should be bought and studied by all
 lecturers (and read by all students!) in musicology, and should be in
 the library of every institution teaching music at an advanced level.
 Perceptual psychologists should also include it high on their
 reading lists, and I am sure that engineers, mathematicians and
 physicists will enjoy it.  I found it absorbing reading (and
 listening!), and I can recommend it to anyone with an interest in the
 fundamental psychological or acoustic basis of music.

********END OF REVIEW QUOTE**************

The last paragraph is 200% right.  High praise indeed, and, having 
read the book cover-to-cover twice (and more) I've absolutely no 
doubt it is deserved.

Thought you'd all like to see this....... Hope you didn't mind me 
blowing your 10-ET trumpet Bill !
