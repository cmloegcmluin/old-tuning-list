Subject: Indian music, Danielou

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

As usual, there seems to be much speculation, but little definitive
info, about the scales of Indian music. God knows it's a huge place, also
very old, so the possibilities are interesting. I personally believe that
the traditional (before the white guys took over) tunings were closely
related to the natural overtone series...I think it highly unlikely that
they were playing in any sort of eq temp until recently. A sitar has
moveable frets...no need for that if you only use an eq temp. Sarods are
fretless, ideal for finding the pure notes/ratios. Just look at the cover
of various sitar albums, and you will notice that the frets are NOT
always equally spaced. Of course, Shankar and others have played with
Western orchestras and such...perhaps they adapt their sound to the
tempered scale.
    Also, several folks have said Danielou's book is questionable, but no
one has said why...why? What did he say that was incorrect, and what,
then, IS correct? Hstick
