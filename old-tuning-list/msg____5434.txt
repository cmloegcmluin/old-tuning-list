What is the term Phrygian JI scale ? I presume David that you mean a mode
that begins on the third degree of a JI scale (I looked for confirmation
in Doty's primer to no avail and my past experience of the terms dorian
phrygian lydian is based on 12-TET where each of these modes is an octave
of white notes starting on D, E, F and so on). I was unaware that these
terms still apply in the world of JI. 

BTW, Doty's book is wonderful. Manuel's Scala program too. Through Csound,
I am at last able to build on the theoretical input of people on this
list by experiencing the physical reality of the tuning itself.
