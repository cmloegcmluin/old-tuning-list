Subject: Copyright on files in the ftp archive and MMPI

From: ladins@ibm.net (L. Dunn)

Hi,
	I have been developing a shareware program called Microtonal MIDI 
Performance Instrument for Atari computers (I should be porting it to 
the Mac soon). As part of the hypertext documentation I would like to 
include some files from this archive's FTP site, namely mclaren's 
microtonal bibliography and discography. Is this OK?

		WARNING- blatant plug follows

	Some of the features of MMPI are:
* designed for real-time performance
* full graphical interface
* can use either polyphonic aftertouch or pitch bend as the means of 
pitch shifting
* when using pitch bend, a dynamic channel allocation algorithm is 
used i.e. polyphony is not limited to monophonic lines but the number 
of MIDI channels you give it
* uses tuning 'presets' that may be switched between using program 
change messages
* can have two different tuning systems being used simultaneously
* 1-step generation of any ET scale (of course not limited to octaves)
* all files are standard ascii text (full description of file formats 
is provided)
* tuning systems may be loaded as ratios, cents or frequencies, and 
are extrapolated to either a) 128 notes, or b) the entire MIDI 
frequency range).
* a C library is provided for microtonal algorithmic composition with 
full access to the 'preset' data structure so it can be modified in 
real-time
* ... :-)
	The shareware fee will be Australian $35 + postage with the 
hypertext manual. 

	A Aussie dollar is about 75 US cents or 47 UK pence.

	There is an old an buggy demo available at 
ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/tos/q/q152/
	This is going to be updated soon (after I've finished the 
hypertext + a few more changes).
	If you feel like digging out that old ST be warned that MMPI 
requires a hi-res monitor.
	There are currently atari emulators that re-direct the ST's
internal MIDI port for both the Mac (MagiC Mac) and PC (Gemulator).
Both can be bought from Toad Computers http://www.toad.net
	MMPI _should_ work with both of these but it has not been tested.
	There is a demo version of MagiCMac that doesn't re-direct 
MIDI at ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/tos/p/p144/
	There is also a freeware atari emulator for X-Windows 
(including Linux) called STonX. This should be available from 
ftp://micros.hensa.ac.uk/micros/atari/ (somewhere). I don't know it it 
re-directs the ST's MIDI port though...

	If you would like to speed up the port donations of power Macs 
or Pentium PCs are welcome :-)

	Please send suggestions/comments/info about compatability with 
emulators to:
