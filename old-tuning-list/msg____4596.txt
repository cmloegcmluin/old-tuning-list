I let this sit for a while, but I find this positively repulsive.

(1) If you can hum what you're composing (a good sign that you're making 
music rather than marks on a page), then humming spontaneously (even slowly, 
and correcting errors) is improvisational skill. That may not be helpful to 
the mastery of a particular instrument, but it sure leads to better 
composition!

(2) Many masters of instruments cannot improvise to save their lives. Many 
master improvisers create compositions in a realm very different from the 
five-line staff -- details will change from performance to performance, 
rhythms will transcend rational notation, the musical experience will 
reflect the immediate conditions of the moment, communication between 
audience and performer will occur -- in all, the music will have a structure 
that has more in common with real-time human thought processes.

(3) Noodling on a staff is less musical than noodling on an instrument, and 
noodling on an instrument qualifies as poor improvisation at best.

(4) I went to a very prestigious university. The senior composition class 
was far beyond my qualifications to enroll in. The performance of final 
compositions from this class SUCKED. There was not one note of music in the 
whole thing -- I couldn't have IMPROVISED anything worse if I tried. 
Meanwhile, rock groups were playing in basements, improvising away, and 
sometimes reaching levels beyond pure entertainment. (I should note that a 
performance of compositions from the graduate school of the same university 
was far more musical and far more challenging -- however, the undergraduate 
symphony orchestra positively DEMOLISHES the grad school orchestra!)

(5) The ultimate musical experience. Hmm. Aside from that once-in-a-lifetime 
improvisation where it feels like your hands are controlled by a higher 
power, this would have to include listening to Jimi, or Duke, or one of Bach 
or Chopin's "frozen improvisations" (if only we could capture their actual 
performances out of the vibrations in the air). I'll skip Wynton Marsalis' 
jazz "compositions."

Blah blah. No one can say it better than Neil already did. Anyway, we need a 
lot more composition AND improvisation before the 12-tone monarchy is 
overthrown; each element of music-making needs the other to grow and 
prosper. Denying that is denying microtonality's very viability.
