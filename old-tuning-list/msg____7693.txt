Like someone pointed out, there's no m3.

I will not have a chance to take a serious look at this 'till
some time this weekend. I wanted to write full reviews of
the American Festival of Microtonal Music (5/7-8/98) NYC
and hang out 'till dawn talking microtones.



It's 3:30 am. The short report:

Both Sasha and Johnny Reinhard are very light on their feet.

Sasha's 1/2 hour Atom Turning in the Sun of Eternity exceded
my expectations - 20 tone 7 limit JI.

John Schneider's performance of Lou Harrison's Suite #2 - can you go
wrong here???!!!

Virgil Morfield's (Slight Return) - 48tet, glisses

and Johnny Reinhard's Adam and Eve - another theater/polymicrotonal 
like last year's Odysseus. As good or even better.
Johnny and Christina Coppola are naturals with fig leafs.


Hopefully folks can still make Friday night's show...5/8/98
8pm, Columbia U., St. Paul's Chapel


and now the weather...
