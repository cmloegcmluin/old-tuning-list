Subject: fractal SaRiGa-Mandel thangs....now on the net!!

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.ne.jp>

BUYO-BUYO-IGOR @ SaRiGaMa's Oil Vending Orchestra typing..
My friend Yo-san contributed a page for the "Hz on Hz" project.
Based on the Hz info at:
http://www.bigfoot.com/~gianthead
he created several microtuned fractal midi-files for the preparation of the 
studio-jammin thing..
but you can also take a listen..
his page is at:
http://www.fin.ne.jp/~yokubota/sarigama.shtml
and why not have other things linked to this result?
cosund files?...midis...aiffs...
looping several files together is reeeealy minimal...
thanx
