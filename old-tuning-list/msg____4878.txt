While there are a lot of interesting issues that have been raised in this
exchange, I would specifically like to respond to the one about historical
precedence of tuning models for the diatonic scale.

Dan Wolf talked some about the distinction between theory and practice, and
I think it's a crucial distinction. First, when does a culture NEED a
precisely defined, standardized tuning system? Several possible answers
occur to me (though there may be others): 1) when it is desirable for
several fixed-pitch instruments to play together (the definition of
"fixed-pitch" may be a gray area, I know), 2) when there are instruments
with frets or a single sounding body per pitch (even then they don't
necessarily have to be standardized), 3) when there is an important
numerological justification.

Many cultures don't meet any of these criteria. Even those for whom #3 is
important, such as India, China, Persia, and (sometimes) ancient Greece,
there's often no evidence that these mathematical constructs had any
relationship to practice. Lacking that evidence, the possibility arises
that so-called Pythagorean tuning was invented as a way of describing
musical systems already in practice. While it's possible to derive scales
purely mathematically, I am skeptical that most scales, including the
diatonic, were initiated this way.

Perhaps scales evolve intuitively, though that intuition may be based on
mathematical models that may not be verbalized by the musician. (Thus the
octave is virtually universal, but musicians may not be aware that its
significance derives from its closeness to 2:1). Overblown fifths, small
number ratios, Pythagorean cycles, tendency towards equal step sizes, these
are all possible models for an (originally) unspoken basis for the diatonic
scale. If that's the case, I don't think it's possible to say for sure
which is correct from a historical point of view.

When dealing with non-fixed-pitch instruments, we are in even more trouble.
The deviations from a theoretical standard tuning system of a melodic line
sung by a voice alone or played on a bamboo flute alone can easily approach
the syntonic comma. Oh, I know, some of this may just be bad musicianship,
but I still think it's very problematic to derive a precise tuning system
from such music. Indian sources, it's true, give elaborate tuning
instructions for the vina, but nearly all of them, back to the vedas,
ascribe primacy to the human voice.
