Subject: Tuning list archives

From: "J. Pusey" <pusey@remqhi.ENET.dec.com>

Douglas Nunn complained last week that there was no archive for this mailing
list. This is not true. Dave Madole posted an announcement back in September
that archives are available via FTP and via listproc. Check out the following:

ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/list/archive           (pre-digest archives)
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/list/archive/digests   (digest archives)

Also, you can send e-mail to listproc@eartha.mills.edu with subject blank
and "INDEX TUNING" in the body to retrieve an index of what's in the archive,
and then send a message with "GET TUNING <filename>" in the body to retrieve
a particular digest or pre-digest archive part.

Sorry, for the belated response, but I was away from my computer all last
week.
