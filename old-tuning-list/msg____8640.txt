Subject: Tuning Co-op

   My reaction is this:  Brian would be wonderful to have at the helm for
his enthusiasm, for the fact that he's interested in all types of unusual
tunings, and because he actually DOES have the time to spend on it.  On the
other hand, he's a less-ideal choice because he's rather opinionated and has
managed to alienate some people.  I can see that one going either way.
