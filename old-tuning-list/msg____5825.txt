I don't dispute the basic point that Mozart didn't use 12TET, but a
couple of things:

1. The name you're trying for is Owen Jorgensen.  It's a big area but
let's just say that many scholars consider his arguments for the
lateness of 12TET standardization weak.

2. If one cared to, one could find a lot of people on earlymus-l and
hpschd-l who can tune passable ET without electronics--it might not be
1 cent accurate, but key color variation will be subtle to
indetectable.  One recommended technique bypasses the usual tuning by
fifths and tempers the cycles of major and minor thirds, using fifths
only as a final check.
