Subject: Theory vs. Practice

From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com>

The recent "pop in microtones" issue is one I had planned to avoid, since it
seemed that any contribution I could make would be destructive.  But, maybe
I've found a way...

There is a difference between compositional models and methods of
performance.  Musicians will always play things differently between one
another, and between performances.  My high school choir sang in crappy
5-limit JI.  The only things that play in 12:2 equal are a few pianos, some
guitars, and many synthesizers.  No band, choir, or orchestra performs in
12-tone.  Why do you think piano concertos sound so bad?

Actually, all music is microtonal (unless it's played on a hammond organ or
a very special additive synthesizer) because of the harmonics!  Yeah!

The point of JI is that it offers an expanded compositional model.  Music
composed in such a model will no doubt be played in all sorts of ways by the
musicians of the future.  An understanding of tuning is not a prerequisite
for playing this music, as DFinnamore@aol.com suggests; our future musicians
will be making more powerful music because it will be based on a more
powerful model.

If we can agree that there is a difference between re-tuning music made for
100 cent equal, as powerful a model and good-sounding a tuning as it is, and
playing music made for 7+ limit Just Intonation, however embellished, then
maybe we can be free to appreciate the excellent musicianship that thrives
in every idiom the world over.

Carl

Postscript:  I get more milage from BBshop than Mr. Szanto, and I'm
wondering what "4tet fan" means.
