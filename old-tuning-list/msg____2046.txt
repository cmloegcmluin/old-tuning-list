Subject: Tuning & psychoacoustics - post 2 of 25

Many and strange are the myths which
afflict so-called "modern" music theory,
particularly when it comes to the operation
of the human ear.
Most of these tall tales have been handed
down to present-day musicians from the 19th
century, although some of the myths date 
from much earlier--as early as the number
mysticism of Pythagoras, the Babylonians,
the Egyptians, and of Hindu astrology.
Shockingly, typical "modern" music theory
texts cite Helmholtz, Rameau and Mersenne
as the sole authorities on acoustics and 
psychoacoustics--or they cite other 
"modern" music theory texts which cite
only these musty & antique sources.  
This is comparable to a "modern" science
text citing Lagrange, Hamilton and
Newton as authorities on the nature of
subatomic physics.   A physics professor
who wrote such a book would be laughed 
out the profession--but for some reason
this practice is acceptable in music.
Together, this antique trove of musical
old wives' tales and acoustic "just-so stories" 
constitutes a body of misinformation
which has been handed down through 
textbooks which thoughtlessly draw on
older textbooks, until the chain of
errors reaches back through 3 centuries
or more.
Partch has illuminated a few links in this
monumental chain of fabulation and
compounded error, but the amount of
misinformation is far larger than
even he could ever have suspected.

Every statement presented in this series 
of posts as fact will be supported
as far as possible by references from 
the scientific literature.  When subscribers
to this forum violently attack these
posts--as no doubt they will--the interested reader 
is  advised not to rely on *my* bare assertions
*or* the unsupported claims of those 
who say "it's [a lie/ignorant/wrong, etc]"
Rather, the interested reader is
advised to go to the original reference
sources. Read them. Search out the audio
tapes & CDs specified below. Listen to them. 
And finally: perform your
own experiments with Csound or a
synthesizer, using your own ears and
a computer.
This last point is *crucial.*
You will need to perform true double-
blind tests on your own hearing to
obtain valid conclusions.  If you concoct
a set of test tones and listen to them
*knowing* what they are, your ears
will lie to you and you will literally
not be able to hear the test tones
and acoustic examples objectively.
Only by using a true double-blind
procedure can you reliably ascertain
what your ears *actually* hear, as opposed
to what you *think* you're hearing.
This is why the most common
objection to the facts of modern
psychoacoustics--"I don't hear it that 
way!"--is utterly meaningless.  Without
A-B-X double-blind tests, none of you
can tell what intervals you prefer (nor 
can I) because the knowledge of what you
*think* you're listening to and what
you *expect* to hear  contaminates
and alters what you hear.

This point is so important that it is
worth an example: 
"The extent to which observers can persist
in the same error of observation was shown
to me by the following experiment. High-fidelity
fans complained about the nonlinear distortion
in a certain sound-transmission system. To test
the maximal distortion these listeners would
tolerate, an induction coil was made with an iron
core that was highly overloaded and produced
nonlinear hysteresis distortion.  A second coil
containing no iron was combined with the first
in such a way that only the pure distortion remained.
Musicians were delighed with this system, which
made tenors' voices sound metallic and heightened 
the dynamics of the orchestra.  Their adjustments of
the system to optimal sound had about 70% pure iron
distortion." [von Bekesy, G., "Hearing Theories and 
Complex Sounds," Journ. Acoust. Soc. Am, 35(4), 
April 1963, pg. 589]
Without an objective reference and
an independent means of measurement,
*we do not know what we hear.*
Over the course of this series of posts,
it will become clear that the ear sometimes
adds to, sometimes subtracts from, and
always changes the information that
enters  our auditory system as 
sound waves.  
For example: 
[1] Highly trained symphony orchestra
musicians reglarly perform intervals as 
small as 683 cents and as wide as 725 cents,
yet hear them  as "perfect fifths;"
["Some Aspects of Perception - I," Shackford,
Journ. Mus. Theory, Vol. 5, 1961, pp. 13-26]
[2] So-called "perfect" intervals, including
the octave and 3/2, can sound dissonant
or consonant depending on the range in
which they sound, even if they use
harmonic-series timbres; ["The Science
of Musical Sound," Sundberg, 1992, pg. 73]
[3] Pitches transposed up an octave can
be heard by musically trained listeners
as dropping slightly in pitch; ["The Science
Of Musical Sounds," Pierce, 1992, pg.  214]
[4] Tones of specific pitch can be heard
by musically trained listeners when in
fact no tones are physically present; and
tones can disappear and become inaudible
to the ear/brain system even though 
they're presented to the ear at high
amplitude; ["Psychoacoustics: Facts and
Models," Zwicker & Fastl, 1993, pp. 91-135;
"The Perception of Musical Tones," Rasch
and Plomp, pp. 1-21, in "The Psychology
of Music," ed. Diana Deutsch, 1982; "The
Science of Musical Sounds," Sundberg,
pp. 48-86.]
[5] The ear/brain system can generate
audible illusions which convince the
listener that s/he is hearing paradoxical 
and impossible sounds--sounds which
simultaneously speed up and slow down,
for instance, or sounds which simultaneously
rise and fall in pitch; or sounds which
rise endlessly in pitch, or fall endlessly
in pitch; ["The Science of Musical Sounds,"
Pierce, pg. 215; "Structural Representations
of Musical Pitch," Shepard, in "The 
Psychology of Music," Ed. Diana Deutsch,
1982, pp. 334-373.]
[6] There is a universal human craving for
stretched intervals, which leads highly
trained musicians to perform so-called
"perfect" intervals consistently wider
than the ratios by which "everyone knows" 
these intervals are defined; ["The Science
of Musical Sound," Sundberg, pp. 104-105,
"Introduction to The Physics and 
Psychophyics of Music," Roederer, pg. 155]
[7] The ear/brain system detects pitch
in a complex way still not fully understood, 
with the result that the pitch of a complex
sounds is perceived to change with
the loudness of the sound, the amount
and onset of noise masking the sound,
the type other harmonic sound played
simultaneously, the degree of harmonicity
of the partials in the sound, the length
of the sound being played, the spectral
centroid of the sound, and the suddeness
of onset of the sound; ["Experiments
On Tone Sensation," Plomp, pp. 127-129;
"Introduction to the Physics and 
Psychophyics of Music," Roederer, pg.
135; "Perception of Timbral Analogies,"
Wessel & Ehresman, Rapports IRCAM 1978,
pp. 1-29, Pickles, James O., "An Introduction
to the Physiology of Hearing," Academic Press,
1988, pp. 270 ff., etc.]
[8] Many of the inner workings of the
ear/brain system are still unknown, and
each of the conflicting theories of how
the ear/brain system hears is supported
by some psychoacoustic evidence, but
contradicted by the rest.
["Experiments On Tones Sensation," Plomp,
pp. 49-52; "The Science of Musical
Sound," Sundberg, pp. 100, 186; "The Science
of Musical Sounds," Pierce, pp. 101, 113-114;
"Rapports IRCAM - Musical Acoustics,"
Risset, 1978, pg. 8; "Introduction To the
Physics and Psychophysics of Music,"
Roederer, 1973, pp. 130-133]

All of which points to the conclusion that
 the ear/brain system is *complex.*
There is no simple explanation for how we
hear.  The ear/brain system generates
false information, destroys some of
what comes into our ears, and transforms
all of it, either subtly or grossly.
Yet the single common thread that will run
through all the so-called "rebuttals" and
attacks on this series of posts will be:
THE EAR IS SIMPLE. "Helmholtz explained it
all," one person will yelp, while others will
screech "Terhardt explained it all," or "Backus'
book tells you everything you need to know!"
The interested reader is advised, again,
not to believe me *or* to believe those who
attempt to rebut me.  Rather, the interested
reader is advised to *study the psychoacoustic
literature,* excerpts of which and references
from which will be listed extensively in every
post.
Only by doing this can the objective reader
get a real sense of the extraordinary complexity
of human hearing, and the self-evident 
falsity of claims that "the ear is simple"
and "Helmholtz explained it all in 1863,"
and "my 1939-vintage references don't say that."
Do not lend your credence thoughtlessly to
*any* statement without *testing for yourself*
the evidence (or lack thereof) for that
statement. Wisdom does not arise from
credulity, but from doubt.
