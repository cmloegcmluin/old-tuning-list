My personal opinion - and I know that many will disagree - is that deciding
between equal-temperaments and most well-temperaments is a comparative small
concern.  The differences between these temperaments, although certainly
historically significant and worth discussing, are fairly small in total overall
sound, compared to quarter-comma meantone for example.  

   Everything I've read and heard suggests that well-temperaments were fairly
fluid at the time.  Everybody had his or her own favorite, often based on how
the organ in that particular town's church was tuned.  Harpsichords and
clavichords had to be retuned virtually every time you sit down to play them, so
they weren't much of an absolute reference like pianos are nowadays.  

   Regarding Bach's Lute works, I suppose it's worth pointing out that while he
composed them with the lute in mind, he himself never had time to master the
lute as a performer.  He therefore wrote them on what computer nerds like me
might jokingly call a "lute emulator" - a specialized harpsichord called a
Lautenwerk.  So those works were probably written with equal-temperament in
mind, but when he himself played them, they were probably were in whatever
well-temperament caught his fancy at the time.
