Subject: Fokker's Matrices

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

I have only been able to find two books of Fokker's writings -- _New
Music with 31 Notes_ and the big one with all his compositions in it,
edited by Rudolf Rasch, I think. The matrix/determinant stuff sounds
like something I need to seriously study. Can someone tell me more about
what Fokker wrote, or perhaps send me some photocopies, for educational
purposes only, and all other disclaimers relevant to copyright
violation? My first question would be which ETs can and cannot be
generated by this procedure and by analagous procedures with axes 5/3
and 3, or 5/3 and 5, and analagously in higher dimensions.
