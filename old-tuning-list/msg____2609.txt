Subject: MIDI pitch bend

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

I'm having trouble getting my EMU Proteus to play microtonally:
I use a Macintosh with Vision, and have sequenced lines, inserting pitch 
bend messages for microtonal alterations.  On playback, though, I kkep 
hearing the "bending" between each note.  How do I get it to attack each 
pitch without these little glissandi?
