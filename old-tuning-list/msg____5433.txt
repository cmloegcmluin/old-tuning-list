Thanks for the invitation, Paul!  This is one of those subjects that never
seems to end.  Maybe it's too large for any one person to comprehend fully.

Brilliant analysis.  That's an issue I hadn't thought of at all, even though
I have experienced the repercussions of it.  It's by far the best reason I
have heard for pursuing ETs other than our beloved 12-tone.  But I've even
found a great deal of pleasure in simple JI scales, usually diatonic.  I
never try to play music composed for 12t-ET in a JI scale - I can't quite see
the point of that.  I usually just fiddle till I get the feel of it and know
a little about how each member functions, and then improvise.  Even with
7-note diatonic JI scales the results tend to be very much more satisfying
than with 12t-ET.  I'm convinced I'll be able to record some
commercially-viable material that way in the near future.  "JI - it's not
just for theorists anymore!"

I think you may have rebutted yourself, there.  With all the unexplored
possibilities of various tuning systems, who needs puns?  Sure, they're
helpful for doing certain things.  So, do other things - whatever the
functions of the tuning at hand provide.  Easier said ... ;-)

A quick set of questions from my ignorance of standard terms: By "34 is just
barely OK", do you mean 34 cents?  If so are those 100ths of the x th-root,
where xof ET divisions of whatever interval; or are "cents" always the
1200th root of the octave?  Or perhaps you mean 34t-ET?

In any event, a very intriguing point and perspective.  However, while you do
enjoy the benefits of extended harmony, you still don't enjoy the benefits of
heart-stopping in-tune-ness.  The first time I played with a Phrygian JI
scale I had distilled from a series of
prime-number-series-numerator-over-power-of-two-denominator ratios (there's
probably a more concise and standard way to indicate that - hopefully you get
the drift) I had chills for a week.  I had the feeling that it was prompting
some sort of "life-force" to well up within me.  (Boy, that sound's weird,
but I can't think of a better way to describe it.)  It's still one of my
favorites.  I'm not very experienced with ETs other than 12t but, from what I
have heard and experimented with, you just can't get that same sort of primal
response to the music from an ET-derived scale.

The scale I referred to runs thusly: 1:1 (no kidding!), 17:16, 19:16, 4:3,
3:2, 51:32, 57:32.  I put the 57:32 on note #11 and add 7:4 on note #10 so I
can throw that shocker in where appropriate.  The note numbers refer to a 12t
keyboard.  I found that harp or other ringing plucked-string sounds tend to
draw a good vibe out of this scale.

True enough.  Depends on the idea.  If you start with some seed of a musical
scheme that guides you by its nature in the direction of an ET for its best
realization, great.  That seems a bit self-evident, though.  Am I missing
your point?  I don't suppose you're gonna help Marion make his previous point
by saying that most ideas are easier to work out in an ET?

In a #1063 posting, I explain in more detail there why I think JI scales are
more promising in the long run.

>Does the existing [12t-ET] repertoire have enough diversity to provide a 
>lifetime of listening enjoyment of the most transcendent and sublime sort? 

I'll never forget the state of mystical transport that I was in after hearing
a live performance of Brahm's Requiem when I was in school.  I was affected
similarly by performing, as part of a choir, Bach's Christmas Oratorio and
several pieces by Mendelssohn.  But I'm beginning to find that there is even
more power in music with "pure," resonant chords and scales.  It seems that
there is more potential there, and I believe that is because it reflects more
closely the way that we are made.

As to diversity - I'm torn there.  So many musicians seem to have given up on
the idea of harmonic originality, choosing the easier route of sonic shock
value (e.g., Nirvana).  But just when you think you've heard it all, some
genius comes up with a gem that was lying right in front of our eyes (or
ears) all the time.  (Jerry Rafferty's changes, simple as they were - mostly
triadic, still blow my mind.)  How much longer can that go on?  Hard to say.
 But clearly, we can improve our chances with any system that expands our
choices.

Just tune it!
