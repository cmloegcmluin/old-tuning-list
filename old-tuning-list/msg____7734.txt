Subject: Odd vs. Prime and Lattice Diagrams

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

Paul Erlich, did you ever consider the fact
that the relationships between ratios which
are so elegantly portrayed in your triangular
lattice diagrams are the result of nothing other
than prime factorization?

(When I first developed my lattice diagrams --
and I thought then that I had done it first! --
they were an outgrowth of the Duodenarium
published by Ellis in his appendix to Helmholtz's
book. I have since found out that lattices very
much like mine have already been devised to
described JI pitch resources by Ben Johnston,
Joel Mandelbaum, Adrian Fokker, even Hugo
Riemann, and now also Graham Breed.)
