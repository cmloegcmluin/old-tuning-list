Subject: Re: TUNING digest 1377

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Composing begins with form.  The music is poured into the shape of the
form.  Tuning is the way the form is fractured, perhaps comparable to a
set of stain glass windows.   Microrhythms are as pertinent as
microintervals of pitch: rhythms are intervals of time.  Forms do need to
be original.  More than ever, staying in established convention is
sounding square.  If it sounds like something else it is derivative, good
for the immediate short term but inadequate for the long term. IMHO.
