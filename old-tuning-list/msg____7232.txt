Subject: microtnl autoharp

From: Erik Nauman <ENauman@TrevorDaySchool.pvt.k12.ny.us>

Check the Deep Listening Space web page for a performance I'm giving
with Doug Cohen on April 4. Doug uses all kinds of electronic
manipulation in his music and I will perform four pieces for a
microtonal autoharp tuned to an 11-limit just intonation. If you're in
the Kingston neck of the woods, drop in!
