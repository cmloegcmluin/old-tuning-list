Gary,
Yes, you are correct. There is a difference. My comments are meaningless 
with respect to a "relations between the fundamental and other members of 
the harmonic series" viewpoint, but they do apply to a "small-integer-ratio" 
viewpoint. So why your comment above (first quote above)?

By the way, the difference between the two viewpoints leads to two different 
JI lattice constructions. The RBFAOMOHS view leads to rectangular lattices, 
while the SIR viewpoint leads to triangular lattices. Exploring the 
relationship between these views in 5-dimensional lattices led me to some 
interesting discoveries about the tiling of 5-dimensional space with regular 
hyperpolyhedra (which happen to be various Wilson CPSs from [1,3,5,7,11]).
