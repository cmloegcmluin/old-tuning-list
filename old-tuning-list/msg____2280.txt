Subject: what is JI music?

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

I hope that this post will generate some good discussion, as it is quite 
important for me to reckon with these ideas before writing quality music 
in just intonation.  Perhaps it is a concern that has been beat to death, 
and perhaps it is one that is purely rhetorical.  In any case, I think 
that it cannot be answered by long lists of numbers, but rather with long 
strings of adjectives.

A piece of mine for just-tuned piano was first performed on September 28, 
and when a piano could not be tuned and a suitable synthesizer could not 
be found, I decided that the musical purpose of the piece could still be 
expressed on an ordinary piano, dull tuning.  Although the intended 
11-limit tuning varies far from equal temperament, it is octave-repeating 
and fits under the hands well.  No pitch strays much more than a 
quarter-tone from its 12TET version.  The piece was received extremely 
well, with hosannas all around.

Since making a tape on the synthesizer, I have shown it to many people 
and gotten many different responses.  Mostly, it is bewilderment, and a 
refusal to hear the basic musical qualities which were so well received 
when the piece was performed without unfamiliar tones to get in the way.  
The most important response came not from a composer, but from theorist 
Paul Wilson, who claimed that tonal music such as this doesn't work in 
JI as well as in 12TET.  Basically, he is saying that the 4:5:6:7 chord 
is too stable to provide directed tonal motion to a consonance, and that  
moving from complicated (higher-number) sonorities to simpler sonorities 
is not interesting enough in itself to sustain a piece of music.

Is just-intonation, as Ben Johnston says, indeed adaptable to any style of 
music?

Can a composer write JI music that provides tonal motion rather than just 
common-tone modulation?  Can this be done with a mere 12 notes or less?

If the answer to these is "no", for what style is JI best suited?

I hope that people will not simply advocate their own styles, but rather 
discuss this in general, musical terms.
