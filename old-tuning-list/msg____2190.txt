Subject: The accuracy of tunable MIDI synthesizers
---
>From time to time a recurrent gripe surfaces throughout the microtonal 
community.  It centers on the supposedly "crude" tuning accuracy of 
the typical synth module.  Ezra Sims is the most  vocal proponent 
of this notion: he claims that the coarse tuning resolution of modern 
MIDI synths makes them unusable for just intonation.  
Does this claim have any basis in fact?
First, a word about tuning tables and synths. Tuning tables on MIDI 
synths have standardized on two accuracies: 1024 TU per octave and 
768 TU per octave.  By far the most common tuning table standard is 
768 TU/oct (64 steps per 12-TET scale step). This is the standard 
used for tuning tables in the E-Mu Proteus I, Proteus II, Proteus 
3, UltraProteus and Morpheus synths, along with the Yamaha TX11 and 
TX81Z and the Waldorf Wave and MicroWave synths. (Dick Lord also  
states that a tuning table accuracy of 768/oct is buried inside the 
Ensoniq VFX, VFX-SQ, TX10, EPS,  EPS-16+ and ASR-10.  Most post-1988 
Ensoniq synths are microtunable and let the user input values to the 
nearest cent, but the tuning tables when entered have a tendency to 
jump around after you've set 'em.  This would be consistent with a 
tuning table quantum of 1.5625 cents, or 768 tuning units per octave.)
In any case it's clear that the 768 tuning units per octave has become 
a de facto standard.  So it's worth  discussing in some detail the 
question of the  purported "crudity" of this TU (tuning unit).
The first important point is that there is a big difference between 
the *SIZE*  of the TU in the synth's tuning table, and the  
*ACCURACY* of a specific tuning entered into that tuning table. 
Everyone knows, for example, that the accuracy of a synth with a tuning 
table having 768 parts per octave is 1.5625 cents: that is, 1200/768 
cents.
Everyone knows this, and it's  wrong.
In fact, the accuracy of the synth depends on the  particular tuning 
chosen. For example: if you tune your synth to 12 equal tones per 
octave, the worst error is zero cents--and the average error is zero 
cents.  This, because 12 is evenly divisible by 768 (768/12 = 64) 
so each step of 12/oct falls exactly on a TU in the synth's tuning 
table.  Thus for 12/oct (every 64 TUs), 24/oct (every 32 TUs), 48/oct 
(every 16 TUs), 96/oct (every 8 TUs), 192/oct (every 4 TUs), 384/oct 
(every 2 TUs) and 768/oct, the average error = the worst error of 
the worst-tuned note...namely, zero cents.  For these scales, you 
get perfect tuning accuracy within the limits of the jitter of the 
synth's clock crystal and the sample-and-hold in the D/A converter. 
---
What about *other* tunings than power-of-two multiples of 12?
To a first approximation, the *average accuracy*  of  any given 
tuning should be somewhere around (1.5625/2) cents = 0.78125 cents.  
This assumes that in the worst case a scale-step lies no more than 1/2 
a tuning unit away...a logical enough assumption, as it turns out. 
Remember:  if a given note is *more* than 50% of a TU above the 
one chosen, accuracy could be gained by jumping  up to the next 
higher tuning unit.  
For example: if a desired scale-step were 1.6 tuning units away from, 
say, 324 TU, we could gain accuracy by setting the synth to 326 TU 
so that the error would be -40% of a TU instead of +160% of a TU.  The 
same argument applies if the desired tuning step is more than 50% 
below the set tuning unit. This cuts our 1st-approximation guesstimate 
of the average error down to 1/2 of 1.5625 cents, for an average error 
of 0.78125 cents.  But even this average error is actually too large.
A moment's thought tells us that the accuracy is likely to be 
significantly better than that on average, because it's *highly* unlikely 
that every single step in our scale will be maxed out at the worst 
possible 50% error of a TU error.  Thus, at first glance, the average 
accuracy is likely to be much less than 50% of a TU-- that is, 
<< 0.78125 cents.
How likely?
Well, at this point I'll diverge into a brief paragraph on the integrals 
of  Gaussian vs. non-normal distributions over a given region.  The 
integral of such a statistical distribution within an interval gives 
the signed probability of an event within those numerical parameters; 
for a normal or Gaussian distribution this is generally expressed 
in terms of standard deviations from the mean.  The measurement is 
non-linear, so that (if memory serves) 2 standard deviations out from 
the mean excludes nearly 98% of the probable outcomes.
Alas, this logic presumes a perfectly  Gaussian distribution of 
scale-steps.   
Clearly no musical tuning follows this distribution; a graph of the step 
size of equal-tempered scales, for instance, shows a rising line 
y = mx + b, not a bell curve. Similarly,  a graph of the free-free metal 
bar scale successive step size is proportional to the square of the  
hyperbolic cotangent (see Rossing, 1992, for details), while a graph 
of the distribution of step-sizes of Harry Partch's 43 tones is a 
stepped histogram with a bunch of near-equal clumps (since  21/20's 
84.5 cents - the 33/32's 53.2 cents falls within 0.5 cents of the  
81/80's 21.5 cents - the 33/32's 53.2 cents...and so on).  That is, 
a number of the successive step-sizes in Partch's 43-tone  scale are 
nearly identical, so their distribution again does not look anything 
like a bell curve. (Again, it's a shame there are no graphics available
on this tuning forum. Since the internet is hurtling us into the future
at the speed of light, naturally we're stuck in 1970 with dark ages
ASCII-only on-line technology.  Naturally!)
Using  back-of-the-envelope guesstimates which would make even the 
most reckless mathematician cringe, a flat-line ET scale- step 
distribution by the halfway point would have considerably less area than 
a Gaussian bell curve, while beyond the halfway  point it'd have lots 
more area...so call it (1.8 + 0.25), or maybe 2.05 or so times the total
 Gaussian area, while a hyperbolic cotangent's area over the domain would
 at a  wild guess come out to perhaps 70% of the area of a bell curve...  
So the expected average error in an ET scale should be about twice that 
of the bell curve average error, while for the free-free metal bar 
scale it should be perhaps 70% of the (1.5625/2) cents/step average.  
(End of digression.  Bet you never thought a discussion of tuning 
accuracy on synths would involve probability integrals!)
What does all this mean?
It means that the actual tuning accuracy for a 768 TU/oct synth is 
likely to be completely different from what we'd expect from our 
simplistic argument above (which led to the conclusion that the accuracy 
should be << 0.78125 cents per scale step on average).
On reflection, this is obvious.  Most real-world tunings will exhibit 
a mix of large and small errors, with the largest error being a bit 
less than 0.78125 and the smallest errors (excluding the always-zero 
root note or 1/1) probably hovering around 0.01 or so. So to a second 
approximation the average error should range twixt 0.2 cents and 0.4 
cents, depending on the exact shape  of the statistical distribution 
of step-sizes in the tuning, and the exact location of the mean 
step-size.
This tells us that to get real concrete answers, we'll need to do 
some actual number-crunching and try a mini-Monte Carlo analysis. 
So let's see what the actual worst scale-step, best scale-step and 
average (total cents error divided by total number of scale-steps) 
is for a number of different tunings:

The average error per scale step is 0.40561  cents. The worst error 
is 0.777 cents--roughly 3/4 of a cent--and the best-tuned scale step
has an error of 0.016  or about 1/60 of a cent.  These numbers are 
well within the  range of our second approximation back-of-the-envelope 
calculation.

A median has little meaning for these sets of numbers, since
no error appears more than twice and there are many errors
in that category.  A median decile might have more significance,
but its musical meaning is debatable--at least as debatable
as that of the mean or average error.
The average error is 0.41635 cents/step, similar to that of the Partch 
scale.   As before, absolute cents are summed and divided by the total 
number of scale degrees, and the 1/1 is ignored so as not to artificially 
lower the average error.

In this case the error's somewhat higher than previously: average 
error of 0.523515 cents per step. Withal, still quite small.
For all the just intonation scales considered above, the average of  
the average errors/scale step is 0.458 cents.  This implies that if 
you tune an arbitrary JI scale, your average error/step will be around 
0.4 cents, with the average error increasing slightly as the number 
of steps in your JI scale decreases.
As is readily apparent, 0.4 cents is a far cry from the 1.5625 cents 
generally quoted.  Clearly for JI scales the tuning *accuracy* 
(for real-world scales) of a 768 TU/octave synth is *far* better 
than has been bruited about by microtonalists who don't know their 
math.
So much for the tuning accuracy of a JI scale on a 768 TU/octave  
synth.  But what about equal tempered scales?
Rather than stupefy you with a recitativo of the error per scale step 
for various equal temperaments, here's the  output from my simple 
BASIC program for various ETs:
 
TONES/OCT 	AVERAGE ERROR/STEP  WORST ERROR  BEST ERROR
		IN CENTS	     IN CENTS         IN CENTS
[5] 5/oct	0.375		   0.625		0.0
[6] 13/oct	0.3883115	   0.600952      	0.0
[7] 19/oct	0.3895362	   0.65789	 	0.0
[8] 31/oct	0.3902204	   0.705688      	0.0
[9] 41/oct	0.3040017	   -.7241209    	0.0
[10] 53/oct	0.39048162	   -.7370605    	0.0
[11] 72/oct	0.34722140	   0.5208282    	0.0
 
Total average error: 0.369 cents, slightly lower than in the JI scales 
considered above, probably because the ET scales have a fixed step 
size thus a more even distribution of error sizes.
As you can see, the average error per scale step is just about as 
low for ETs as for the just intonation scales above.  And in  all 
cases less than 0.4 cents.  Again, a damn small tuning error.
To give you an idea of how small: at 100 Hz the ratio twixt two notes 
using harmonic-series overtones (one note tuned with perfect accuracy 
in the target scale, one note tuned in the best approximation allowed 
by the synth) would amount to a whopping 2^[0.3040017/1200]  = 2^
[2.833475  exp -4] = 1.0001964 for the 41/oct case.  At a fundamental 
of 100  Hz this would produce an out-of-tune note of 100.01964 Hz, with 
a  fundamental beat rate of 1 beat every  50.911 seconds. (Of course, 
the 2nd harmonic would beat at twice that rate, with additional sum 
and difference tones...and so on.)
Now, come on, people...  Can you *really* hear the difference 
between 1 beat every 51 seconds and the normal internal beating and 
vibrato from a real-world acoustic instrument?
Is that reasonable?
Is an average beat rate of 1 per 51 seconds really something to get 
all het up about?  Is anyone in your audience going to jump up and 
shout "I can hear it!  It's out of tune!  There was a full two 
thousandth of a beat in that sixteenth note at metronome marking 100!"
Please.
How many notes in the average JI or  xenharmonic equal-tempered  
composition would last long enough to hear even *one fourth*  of a full
 beat-complex?  
Even assuming (that is) that your acoustic-instrument performers 
were exactly, perfectly, precisely 100% in absolute theoretical tune 
with the ideal frequency of the note required, to a full 6 or 7 digits 
of precision! 
Now, let's think about this, people.  This cursory little statistical 
analysis tells us unequivocally that even with a purportedly "coarse" 
tuning grid like 768 TU per octave, any audible error when playing 
a synth with a live ensemble *far* more likely to be caused by 
the *live  ensemble*  rather than the synth.
Bearing in mind that Partch's tuning accuracy (which he required in 
tuning his acoustic instruments) was "better than 2 cents," how likely 
do you think it that any of the performers *or* the audience 
will hear errors in the synth tuning averaging around 1/3 of a cent?  
That's a tuning precision 6 times better than the accuracy Partch 
demanded! The only possible conclusion to be gained from this little 
investigation into the statistics of tuning accuracy is that concerns 
about the "coarseness" and "inaccuracy" of a 768 TU synth are wildly 
overblown. Now, some of you might argue about the significance of an 
"average" tuning error (isn't the audience likely to hear and remember 
the  *worst-tuned* notes, rather than some numerical "average"?).
Rather than dispute the point, let's grant it.
Even so..the worst tuning error in most cases is still likely to be 
no more than twice the averages cited above.  That is, about 0.68 
cents--*WORST CASE*.
This means that the absolute worst-tuned note
 played with a 768 tuning-unit synth would be mistuned by a ratio of
 2^[0.68/1200] = 2^[5.66 exp -4] 
= 1.0003929:1.  For a properly-tuned note of  100H z this would 
produce an out-of-tune note of 100.03929 Hz, and a fundamental beat 
rate of 1 beat every 25.45 seconds.
Can anyone seriously contend that this kind of so-called "inaccuracy" 
is anything that even the keenest-eared member of the audience would 
ever hear in anything but an hour-longLaMonte Young drone composition?
>From now on, let's have no more of these preposterous claims that 
is a very coarse and inadequate grid for [fill in the blank...just 
intonation, equal temperaments, meantone,whatever]."  The facts do 
not support such a contention.
In fact, if Johnny Reinhard can produce a computer-analyzed solo from 
of any of his live acoustic performances in which the average note 
was no farther off than 1/3 of a cent, I'll eat his entire  collection 
of microtonal manuscripts.  With Worchestershire sauce.  In one sitting!
In real-world live acoustic solos, performed notes are generally played 
*much* farther off than 0.3 to 0.4 cent...especially at rapid tempi 
above 200 bpm. Sundberg's computer analyses show accuracies for 
professional musicians in the neighborhood of 10 cents, while Shackford's
 computer analyses show average accuracies for symphony performers in the
 neighborhood of 15 cents.  This is *worlds* away from the average 1/3 
cent error we've found here, and indeed the coefficients of thermal 
expansion for wood and metal are such that an acoustic instrument would 
almost certainly detune by *more* than 0.3 to 0.4 cents simply by 
being moved from a cold car into a warm concert hall.
So let us have no more claims that "768 TU per octave are inadequate 
for microtonal music."
