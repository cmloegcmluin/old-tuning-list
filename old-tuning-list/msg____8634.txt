Subject: Harmony Farmers Co-op (AKA International Intonation Group)

From: "Robin Perry" <jinto83@hotmail.com>

Hello to all who have responded to the idea of some sort of organization 
(association/non-profit corporation/etc.) to be
formed for the purpose of collectively furthering the work in 
microtonality.

I ask all interested parties to respond to the tuning digest with:
a)questions and concerns, b)your vision for such an organization, 
c)your resources - time available/talents/etc., d)whatever else you
can think of that might be pertinent.  You may also reach me at
jinto83@hotmail.com.

I believe that microtones belong in mainstream music.  New notes bring
new ideas...open minds to different ways of thinking. If there is one
valuable social/metaphysical aspect to all of this, it is just that.

Jimi Hendrix blew us into new realms of thought & emotion in the 
sixties.  Microtonalists can do this more subtly, yet every
bit as powerfully with the instruments that are being developed.
The sweetness of a just 4:5:6, the other-worldliness of sevens and
elevens...

That's my vision.  My time is limited, but I'd be willing to act as
a focal point (communications facilitator) until somebody else wants
the job.  I do have some experience in bringing groups together and
setting up seminars. I work as a artist/designer. And I'm a pretty 
good drummer if any one wants to jam.
 
This project reminds me of the "Stone Soup" story.  We throw a couple of 
rocks in the soup pot, and eventually the townspeople start bringing the 
vegetables.  

Robin Perry
