Subject: smashed tape

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Hate to say it, but I've misplaced Warren Burt's email #...in case he 
reads this, Warren...your tapes arrived today, with the cassette smashed 
to pieces. I can't tell if the dat is playable til I get to a studio...if 
anyone has Burt's email, could I pullease get it? And, the forum tapes 
are trickling in...as soon as they're all here, we'll get down...Hstick
