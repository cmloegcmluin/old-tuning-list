Subject: March 7 concert

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Denver went micro as the Haverstick boys played a pretty mean set of 
19 and 34 tone acoustic music at the Houston Fine Arts Center...about 100 
folks showed up, and seemed to really enjoy what they heard. Loose but 
very exciting, notes appeared like fireworks, often surprising the 
players as well as the listeners...and that's just what I wanted to 
happen. Thanks to Alex Lemski for supporting this music...and the people 
of Denver...Hstick PS...a visiting microtonalist was on hand...Carl Lumma 
stopped by on his way to the West Coast...we did our best to make him 
feel at home...
