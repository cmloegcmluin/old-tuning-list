To my friends, 
 
  JOHN SCHNEIDER, on Just intonated classical guitar; 
 
  JOHNNY REINHARD, bassoon, and members of the
    American Festival of Microtonal Music, NYC 
     Mayumi Reinhard, kbds; 
     David Eggar, cello; 
     Guy Tyler, bass; 
     and others,
 
  NEIL HAVERSTICK band (Hstick, 19 and 34 tone guitar; 
    John Starrett, 19/34 bass; 
    Ernie Crews, percussion.
 
  Art tries to express the subjective by means of objective elements.
It always includes the presence of something irrational and although we 
permanently try to rationalize, there will always be something hidden which
belongs to the artist and which even he doesn't know.
 
  Microtonalism is a tool used "to say" better the music but necessarily the
cold number needs to fly through the air, in waves, to get to the ears of the
persons who don't know Pithagoras (Do I know ?), 3/2 and family, cents,
stretchings and etc, etc. So we, the 3 or 4 hundred fans of the Tuning List
need to make MUSIC to justify our work.
 
  As I said before, the next big step which we, the microtonalists, need to
take is to contribute to the development of microtonal instruments, if they
are acoustic much better.
  In this way, common people will start to compose microtonal music using
fixed intonation instruments and in time,  practical microtonalism will be
rationalized.  
 
  MICROSTOCK FESTIVAL was a big event where each one of us was present with
our hearts and minds.
 
CONGRATULATIONS TO NEIL HAVERSTICK !
