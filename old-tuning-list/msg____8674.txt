Subject: Karnatak raga tunings

From: Brian Lee <blee@dircon.co.uk>

For those interested Ive copied out some stuff from The Grammar of South
Indian Music by C. Subrahmanya Ayyar (Madras 1976). The South Indian or
Karnatak (Karnatik or Carnatic) tradition does differ from the Hindustani
or North Indian tradition in many respects: ensemble, instruments used
(S.Indian uses more percussion), the fact that more composed pieces are
played, and the nature of the ragas themselves.  In the last few years
there have been North meets South albums, shocking to the traditionalists
of course.  

Please bear in mind that a raga is not just a sequence of notes. It is
closer to the western idea of a mode in many respects. The Sa or tonic and
Pa or dominant dont change and are used as drone throughout the whole
piece. There are also different stopping places and different note patterns
characteristic of a raga so that the same set of notes could become a
different raga with different melodic patterning. I have read pieces by
Indian writers describing each raga as having its own personality suited to
a particular time of day or season of the year. 

Anyone who wants to hear some of this music I would suggest get hold of
anything you can by Dr. L. Subramaniam who plays ragas on the western violin.
