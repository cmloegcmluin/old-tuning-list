In his address of that year, Einstein traced the history of the
concept and suggested how the term might resonably be applied to the
metrical properties of space-time as modeled in the general theory of
relativity (which physicists still use all the time).  As Gary
Morrison said, he did *not* talk about `ether' as an undulatory medium
for light.  Einstein's `ether' is, however, the medium of gravity
waves. :)

How 'bout the Einstein-Bose statistics, to name only the most
prominent of his lasting post-1920 contributions.
