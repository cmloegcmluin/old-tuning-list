Subject: RE:K2000 & Tuning

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

as James McCartney states, the K2000 is perfectly capable of being 
alternately tuned. I found his technique very original, but there is a more
straightforward method:

When creating or editing your sample root to key assignments in the 
Keymap editor, you will note that you can offset the pitch of any MIDI
note number (actually, all but 0-11) by plus or minus 48 semitones, as well
as plus or minus any number of cents up to 100 (= 1 semitone). Using this 
method, you can divide your octave, twelfth, or whichever favorite interval
ANY WAY YOU LIKE, provided that to-the-cent accuracy is good enough for you.

If the thought of calculating these offset values intimidates you, you 
might like a copy of a K2000 tuning program I've written for the Mac.
It only outputs text files, and it doesn't yet assign the appropriate 
sample root to your keys. However, it does calculate any just or equal
division of the octave, and presents its results as offsets to each
MIDI note no. 

Regrettably, I haven't yet posted this on the web yet, but if enough of
you are interested, or if someone can volunteer a chunk of cyberspace, 
I'll be happy to do so. In the meantime, send me a personal requesting it.


he program is stand-alone, and has an ugly command-line interface, but it 
does the job.
