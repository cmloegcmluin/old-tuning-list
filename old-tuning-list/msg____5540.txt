Subject: Re: French organ tuning around 1700

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net>

Someone wanted to know how French organs were tuned between 1680 and
17-something. My impression is that meantone tuning was being used on
organs all over Western Europe much later than it was being regularly
recommended for harpsichords. Silbermann tuned in meantone (in Germany) --
Ja. S. Bach made a joke out of it: every time he sat down at a Silbermann
organ he would play a piece in A-flat major, where the 'wolf' would howl
until Silbermann was driven from the church.
