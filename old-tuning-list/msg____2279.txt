This is true in the sense that modern means contemporary. However,
ModernISM to me means something much more specific. It refers to an
aesthetic in which being MODERN, and, hence, innovative, becomes a
priority. Thus things that refer to the past, if only a few years in the
past, become "backward-looking" or "conservative." While this is an
oversimplification, as are all labels, and doesn't take into account
movements like neoclassicism, it does aptly describe a major preoccupation
around the beginning of this century.

By the way, few if any of the familiar historical labels we use were in use
(at least in the same way) at the times we associate with them now. And, of
course, their usage has evolved quite differently in music, art,
literature, and philosophy (witness the current confusion about the way
postmodernism is used by philosophers and literary critics and the way it
is used in music, literature, and the visual arts).
