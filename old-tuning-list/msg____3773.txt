Subject: New JICalc version

From: Carter Scholz <csz@well.com>

JIcalc 4.3 is now at 
ftp://mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/mac/jicalc43.sea.hqx

jicalc43.sea.hqx is a self-extracting archive that includes JICalc 
4.3(68K) 
and JICalc 4.3(PPC).  These should fix sound and MIDI problems on 
PowerMacs.  Ken Wauchope very kindly contributed XCMDs that use 
QuickTime and the QuickTime Musical Instruments for PPC sound.

The only other change is a minor fix that remembers the modem/printer 
port selection, so if you have an older 68K machine, there’s no need to 
upgrade.  Version 4.3 requires Quicktime 2.1 (or higher) and QT Musical 
Instruments (available free from Apple).  These system extensions total 
about 2 megabytes, which can be a burden on older systems.  JICalc 
4.3(68K) is there for completeness, in case some users with 68K-based 
systems wish to use the QuickTime instruments.  The number of voices 
has been increased from 4 to 8 (maximum, dependent on system speed).

JICalc is a Hypercard stack that requires Hypercard 2.0 or higher.
