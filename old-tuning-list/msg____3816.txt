Of course, there's also Ezra Sims' notation--he describes it in his article
"Reflections on This and That (Perhaps a Polemic)" in Perspectives of New
Music (I forget in which issue)--and Ben Johnston's notation, best
described by John Fonville in "Perspectives" issue 29, No. 2 (1991).  These
both describe the pitches very closely, although Johnston's are only really
useful for JI, and do not include the convenience of enharmonic spellings.
Sims is good for quartertone, 31-tone, 72-tone and the like.

I did an informal survey recently about what kinds of notations are used by
the people on this list, and only got a couple of responses, which leads me
to believe that most people use staff notation with (a) quarter-tone
accidentals, (b) standard accidentals used for 17TET or similar scales, or
(c) less than 12 tones per octave.

Or perhaps people don't like responding to silly queries.

I have a couple of semantic questions:
1.  (Ken): Who uses the word "allotonality", and who came up with it?
2.  Who is Sheperd of "Sheperd Tones" (pitches which seem to perpetually
rise or fall as in Tenney's "For Ann(rising)")
