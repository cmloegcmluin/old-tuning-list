Hokay , reality check.

Hate to be a wet blanket, but how many commercial synth co.s do you 
think are actually ever going to implement realistic microtuning 
capabilities ? All this wish list stuff  brings out the kid in me ,but 
I've seen
synth models com and go, and "the more things change,the more they stay 
the same".
>From the responses I've gotten from co.s (except Ensoniq!)after enquiring 
about microtuning,
I'd say fat chance. It isn't up there on their list of  "shiny new 
features that will
dazzle  music store visitors and seperate them from their money."

Patrick Ozzard-Low's posting and the suggestions in it (in Tuning Digest 
1443 ,11th June)
 is  beautiful .BUT,dream on.However, I don't believe it would be 
difficult to 
implement.If those engineers can pull off 12 voices of physically modelled
real-time synthesis (Korg Z1,1cent res,global table), I think they can
implement the MIDI tuning std. to the letter. Ok, maybe a resolution of 
0.0061
would be difficult to pull off,but why not atleast 0.1 cent (1024 
divisions
per 12-TET half-step) ? And that menu thing of yours ,Patrick, is very 
nice (and simple).

Ensoniqs do 0.4, the Marion did 0.2. Kyma uses a plain old Motorola 56002
and does  @0.01 (0.0026Hz).

Anyhow, I'm not holding my breath for people like Yama- +/- -63-ha , 
Ro-12note-land,
E-mu,etc. to give users what they really want. Maybe I'll get the Kyma 
in a couple of years,or maybe there'll be a capable software synth 
available 
soon. The Ensoniq MR/ASR-X are good compromises right now. And,if anyone
 does do things right ,it'll be them.They DID put in Gary's 88-CET as a 
reset !

In fact here's what I got from Yuichiro Nagai,Director of Marketing,
Ensoniq Japan Incorporated,regarding the MR series & ASR-X :

And when I asked about user tuning memories;

For PowerMac users there is the Max-MSP combo that will do perfect 
resolution,
specified in Hz!,with considerable real-time synth power 
(albeit with ltd. polyphony) for @ $750. <www.cycling74.com>

Speaking of software synths ,the Retro AS-1 <www.bitheadz.com> and
Vibra-9000 <www.koblo.com> are analog *modelling* synths 
that can do equal temperaments only, using  something called *keytracking*
(I think),that enables you to have more or less notes (per octave  ?).
