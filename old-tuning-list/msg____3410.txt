I have tried this on the only other instrument that I know of designed to
be played on both sides of a bridge -- the European double-bridged dulcimer
-- without success. There are at least two problems: first, the bridge
itself does not have a knife-sharp edge. However, more importantly, it is
impossible on the dulcimer to precisely equalize the tension on both sides
of the bridge. So, while it is a straight-forward matter to get a precise
tuning on one side, the other side will almost always be off, usually a
random amount up to a sixth of a tone or so -- not an insignificant
interval! The folk musicians I have heard play this instrument have the
same problem, but, unfortunately, most of them seemed oblivious to it. If
one has a movable bridge, one can make slight adjustments on the fly, I
suppose, especially if the string is tight and the bridge has little
friction.
