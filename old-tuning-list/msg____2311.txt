This reminds me of something I've been wondering for a while- does any music
school anywhere have a regular course on tuning and JI, maybe even with
tuning's compositional implications?  What I know I've picked up from
reading Partch and Chalmers and messing around with movable frets and JI
Calc.  It would be helpful to have a bibliography and syllabus if such a
course exists.  Larry Polansky once published outlines of a number of his
music courses- something like this for a course in tuning would be
especially helpful. I'm out in the 'working world' and so don't have time to
take a real course, but at least collecting the materials and going through
them would be a step in the right direction.
