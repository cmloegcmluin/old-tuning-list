Subject: Re: Octave Generalization et al.

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Javanese tune their octave out (distinguishing their gamelan practice 
from Balinese, which does not).  I'm told a good ear can tell which 
gamelan is playing exclusively from the size of the octave used in a 
Javanese Gamelan.

Perhaps Dudok playing in Armenia, which does not pass an octave in 
compass, should be considered.  Personally, I suspect the octave to be 
the _only_ universal interval.  The Javanese are the exception that 
proves the rule (since they certainly know what octaves are) and the 
dudok tone in rich in the octave sound.

Re: Brian's post on Partch, I'd like to clear up one thing.  The use of a 
synthesizer for the chromelodian was never an issue.  Even Danlee 
Mitchell accepted this in principle years ago.  The real issue is 
territoriality, also a universal concept.
