From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Yes, and because they do a Lingua Franca notation that centers all 
musicians with the cents system of 1200 dieses to the octave is 
appropriate.  More than I had previously realized.

Since a string players can roll a finger to get about 27 cents, and wind 
players cannot merely "press and blow" and hope to get within 27 cents of 
given pitch target, cents tunes their mind up (not the instrument).

Paul effectively pointed out to me that one need not use numbers higer 
than 25 if noteheads are enharmonically chosen.  In other words, since I 
use notated quartertones and all deviations are an eighthtone or less 
from any particular quartertone, using more than 25 cents would seem moot.

Thinking further, I still like using a number up to 49 cents.  Wind 
players remember new tuning relationships in part by new fingerings.  The 
motoric, physical memory is most valuable in learning new microtonal 
music.  Sometimes the allocation of a single finger to an established 
fingering cements the new pitch to the mind.  Additionally, unneccessary 
enharmonicism might cloud clear tonal relationships that would gain from 
easy recognition.
