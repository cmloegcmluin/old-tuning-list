That is not why. Yasser thought the consonant chord in 19-equal had to be 
constructed as every other note in a 12-note scale in 22. The perfect fifth 
in 19-tone equal is closer to its harmonic series value that the 
approximations to the eleventh and thirteenth harmonics in Yasser's hexad. 
Since the hexad did not include the twelfth harmonic of the same 
fundamental, Yasser concluded that the "perfect fifth" would have to be 
treated as a dissonance. Of course this is backwards, but necessary for 
Yasser to preserve his numerological patterns. These patterns happen not to 
be consistent with each other when the details of Yasser's proposed 
"super-ultra-tonality" or 19-out-of-31 system are worked out.
