Subject: Freshman harmony

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Perhaps it is tough to teach harmonic thinking in theory courses, but 
educational trends do progress, and the best way to encourage the return 
of truth to teaching is to anticipate this change and prepare a 
3-semester course which not only starts at the hararmonic series, but 
encompasses all of the common-practice material needed for entrance to a 
good grad school.  This would include preparation of a pedagogic text, 
recorded examples, etc.

Gary's point was interesting; wouldn't it be a riot to find that community 
colleges  turned out better composers because they trained them with 
methods developed on this forum!
