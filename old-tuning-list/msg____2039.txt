Subject: Amazing Grace on Bag Pipes

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Does anybody know how Amazing Grace became popular to play on Bagpipes?  Just
curious of course.  

   I ask because I finally located a CD of the Scots Guards.  Despite the cover
picture looking military, and bearing the words "In the Finest Tradition", this
CD was kinda popularistic in nature.  But nevertheless it has a few really neat
pieces on it.  The opening cut is Amazing Grace, but what struck me as
surprising about it is that it was performed with woodwinds and brass behind the
pipes rather than the usual drums.  It was actually quite moving;  it had a
surprising sound to it - more than the sum of the parts.
