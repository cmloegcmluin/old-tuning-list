Greetings!

I've read with great interest the topics of this list for some time...

Recently there was mention made of Chinese bells and I remember an excellent
article in the April 1987 issue of Scientific American which describes an 
instrument made of 65 bronze bells recovered by archaeologists in 1978 that
dates back to the fifth century B.C.

An unusual (and rather charming) discovery about these old chime bells is that
they were constructed such that each will produce two separate pitches
depending upon where they are struck (The interval is always a minor or major 
third.).  To quote the article, "The design of the bells requires a 
theoretical grasp of physics and engineering formerly thought to have evolved 
only in the late 18th century."


Thoughts??? Observations???

regards,

dj
