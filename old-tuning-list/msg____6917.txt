What music is this?  Is a recording available?

Yes.  I have also become interested in Johnston on the basis of the Kronos
recording.  I would usually consider the song "Amazing Grace" to be a good
candidate for "most obnoxious song ever written."  Johnston has earned my
respect by arranging it into a piece that I actually enjoy immensely!

>Can anyone recommend other recordings of his music?

I recently picked up a new recording of Johnston's Microtonal Piano pieces.
 (Found it at a local record store!)  Nothing like SQ#4 of course.  It has
some beautiful moments and lots of scary moments.

I've also got a Johnston CD titled "Ponder Nothing", containing various
chamber pieces.  Very worthwhile if you can find it.  I ordered it from
Barnes and Noble.  (It only took them about 7 months to get it.)

I would be very interested in hearing more of his string quartet material.
I think a couple of them are available through CRI?  I haven't followed up
on this yet.

Barstow (and a lot of Partch's vocal material) has never excited me much,
probably because I don't fully understand it.  I think the Schneider
version sounds really out of place wedged in between all those lovely
Harrison pieces.

Incidentally, since the list has recently been discussing microtonal guitar
CD favorites, the two John Schneider discs are right up at the top of the
heap.  I particularly love the Harrison pieces on the Just Strings disc,
but the renditions of Partch's "Two Studies" and Cage's "In a Landscape"
are really swell too.  But the Lou Harrison Music for Guitar and Percussion
is the even more spectacular.  This is a desert island disc for me.  Does
anyone know of any more Schneider recordings in the works?

I like the Catler Crash Landing disc too, although it took me a long time
to get used to it.  Watch out for his other (earlier?) disc "Steel Blue".
I got it from JIN and couldn't believe it was the same guy.  It's kind of
amateurish hard rock, complete with moronic lyrics.  Pretty disappointing
after listening to Crash Landing.

..and one more thing.  Last week after returning home from holiday
travels, I found in my mailbox the Tuning List Swap Tape.  It was my most
unusual Christmas present this year.  Amazing variety of material, giving
me a better glimpse into some of the charmingly psychotic minds
participating in this forum.  Thanks again to Denis, Gary, and whoever else
was involved...
