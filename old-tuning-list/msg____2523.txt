Subject: melodic modes in 19 & 17
---
As mentioned some months ago,
efforts to force-fit the 19 tone
equal tempered scale into the 
melodic patterns familiar throughout
Western music are doomed to 
failure.
This, because there's nothing like a
semitone in the 19-tone system.
Since 19 is a member of the third-tone
family of scales, this is obvious.  Yet
many notation schemes and suggested
melodic modes depend on the mistaken
idea that 19 has something that sounds
or functions like a semitone.
In actual musical practice, two 19-tone
scale-steps do not sound anything like
a semitone--the resulting interval,
126.315 cents, sounds a full quarter
of a semitone larger than the semitone
found in 12.  Alternating this interval
with the 3-step whole-tone in 19
produces a queasy effect that cannot
be described as either "major" or
"minor"--instead, the overall impression
is that of a 7-out-of-48-tone mode
which sounds distinctly out of tune.
Since major and minor melodic modes
do not exist as such in 19, this creates
a substantial conflict.  After all, major
and minor *vertical* triads are easy to
play in 19--but a major or minor melodic
mode are not to be found.
So what's the solution?
The experience of the Southern California
Microtonal Group has shown definitively
that the concept of  major and minor
melodic modes must be abandoned in 19.
To avoid producing a bizarre and queasy
out-of-joint melody, 12-tone melodic
paradigms must be thrown overboard and new 
forms used.
Recently, Jeff Stayton recorded a duet
with me in the 19-tone system.  Stayton
used one melodic mode, while Your Humble
E-Mail Correspondent used another.  Neither
mode, however, had any point of contact
whatever with 12--and as a result, the
combination sounded entirely natural in
19.
My melodic mode used ascending and 
descending subsets of the following:
LssLssssLsL  L = 3 scale-steps in 19,
                      s = 1 scale-step in 19
This "super-mode" appeared as two
different modes, one ascending, the
other descending:
ASCENDING:
LssLsLLsL   (intervals shown as number
                     of 19-tone scale-steps)
I.e., 
1  4  5  6  9  10 12  15  16 (20=1)
                     (scale degrees played: numbered
                     from 1 to 19, with 20 = 1)
DESCENDING:
LsLsLsLsL  (intervals shown as number
                    of 19-tone scale-steps)
I.e., 
20=1  17  16  13  12  11  8  5  4   (20=1)
                   (scale degrees played: numbered
                     from 1 to 19, with 20 = 1)
Variety was added by borrowing additional
steps from the "super-mode" and adding
them ornamentally to either the ascending
or descending mode.
Jeff Stayton's guitar accompaniment used
an entirely different mode:
(Descending)
LsmssmsL  where L = 3 scale-steps in 19
                             s = 1 scale-step in 19
                             m = 2 scale-steps in 19
I.e., 
4  20=1  19  17  16  15 13  12  9
		(scale degrees played: numbered
                     from 1 to 19, with 20 = 1)
Stayton varied his mode by substituting 2
single scale-steps for a 2-degree "m" step:
thus he might play
LsssssmsL instead of LsmssmsL, for
example.
The combination of these two melodic modes
worked smoothly and sounded entirely natural
in 19.  However, they do NOT derive from any
12-tone or Pythagorean paradigm.
More to the point, both of these modes use
*more* than 7 tones.  It has been my experience
when improvising in or writing scores in 19
that more than 7 tones are required for a 
natural-sounding melodic mode.
This should not come as a surprise.  In 1956,
Miller's paper "The Magic Number Seven, Plus
or Minus Two" pointed out that the human
cognitive system is capable of easily 
assimilating as few as 5 or as many as 9
"units."  If each step of the melodic mode
is thought of as a unit, this explains why
9-tone modes come so naturally to 19--
even though such modes use 2 more steps
than the Pythagorean-based 12-tone 
melodic modes familiar from Western music
theory, a 9-tone mode still fits comfortably 
the limits of the  channel capacity of the
human sensorium.
(By contrast, serialism's 12 notes are too
many.)
Thus my experience indicates that at least
8 and usually 9 steps are needed to create a
convincing and natural-sounding melodic
mode in 19.
On the other end of the perceptual scale,
the 17-tone equal-tempered scale sounds
best melodically when used with 5-step
or 6-step modes:
1  6  4  1  5  (ascending: intervals in 
                      number of 19-tone scale-steps)
I.e.,
1  2  8  12  13  17  (18=1)
or
1  6  1  4  4  1 (ascending: intervals in number
                         of 17-tone scale-steps)
I.e., 1  2  8  9  13  17 (18=1) (ascending: scale 
                      degrees played--numbered from
                       1 to 17, with 18 = 1)
Not all xenharmonic equal temperaments 
require a complete rejection of 12-tone
melodic modes.  22, 24, 27, 29, 31, 36 and so on
all have familiar 7-note major and minor melodic
modes.
19, however, does not.  This startling contrast
between the familiar-sounding major and minor
triads available in 19 and the utterly alien-sounding
melodic modes is one of the greatest resources
of the 19 tone equal temperament.  Composers who
ignore this fact do so at the peril of producing
awkward-sounding out-of-joint music that
gives the impression of 12 badly mistuned.
