Subject: some basic info?

From: ozoneent@tribeca.ios.com (Ozone Entertainment)

Hello folks,
I am a musician an budding producer in new york and have always had an
intrest and have noodled with just intonation a touch a few years back but
never really understood the theroies behind it. what little i understand
about it comes from a few EM and keyboard magizine articals they ran about
5 or six years ago which I don't have anymore. My intrests are leading me
more and more in some direction what I am not to sure but that always makes
me feel better sometimes. If any one could recommend a  starting point for
exploring this aspect of music ie books, recordings, and any thing else. I
have been searching the web. I am fortunate to have the time to exsplore my
composing again and would appreciate the help. Thanks a bunch
