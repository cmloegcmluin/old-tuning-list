Quarter-comma meantone was nearly universal for keyboards at the time,   
and would be most appropriate for all of the Virginalist repertoire with   
one exception - that single piece by Bull.  There's nothing tentative   
about the enharmonic equivalence it assumes.  Among other things, there   
is an A - Db - E chord that must be considered the same as A - C# - E.   
 Thus an extension to meantone would not work.

It certainly does not require equal temperament - any 12-note circulating   
one will do.  Personally, I think ET was most likely what Bull had in   
mind.  Mersenne had not yet published his string length figures, but as   
far as I am aware ET was the only circulating temperament being discussed   
at the time.

There was a discussion on the harpsichord list a while ago on what   
temperament to use for this piece.  Various people have successfully used   
everything from ET to one (the name of which escapes me at the moment)   
with 10 pure fifths and two 1/2-Pythagorean comma fifths.

Bull's fantasy was a one-time exception to the use of quarter-comma   
meantone, not to be repeated for almost a century.  Perhaps he did tune   
ET for the piece, but no one liked the sound of it?
