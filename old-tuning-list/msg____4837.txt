"Inversely proportional to the limit" should be "proportional to the square 
of the limit," the square being used since we are dealing with squared 
error. Notice how close this result is to the equal-weighted result, 
696.165, even though the assumptions seem quite different. One can imagine 
many different criteria between these two weighting schemes would lead to 
results within this very narrow range.
