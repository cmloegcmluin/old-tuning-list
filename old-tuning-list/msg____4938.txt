Paul Erlich wrote this (I temporarily repost his articles) but I agree
with him. Personally I think economy is a social and not a natural 
science, but the economic cycles you mention are intriguing nevertheless.
Kepler would agree with you though about the connection between
music and the orbital periods of the planets, described in his 
"Harmonices Mundi" and literally taking them as a tuning system.
