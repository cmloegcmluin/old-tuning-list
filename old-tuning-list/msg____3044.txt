Subject: Sonic Arts Concert

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I want to say  a few words about the concert last Thursday
at the Sonic Arts Gallery in San Diego. The concert opened with 
a duet for 'cello and synthesizer in 15-tet by Brian McLaren
and Jonathan Glasier. Brian played a chordal accompaniment to
Glasiers melodies. The second piece was for synths in Ensoniq's 
"Arabic 1" tuning. What is this tuning? Nobody seems to know exactly.
but whateve it is, it sounded great.  

The third selection was an ambitious tuned percussion study employing 
Erv Wilson's aluminum bar "Hebdomekontany" array (the 4)8 [1 3 5 7 9 11 
13 15] degenerate 70-any with extra notes added to bring the number back 
up to 70 pitches per octave. I believe this is the instrument shown at 
the Hollywood Bowl Museum show several years ago and formerly housed 
at John Gibbon's Bell Garden, now sadly burnt down. It has been remounted 
by Glasier recently. Accompanying the hebdomekontany were the Quadulator 
(Wesley's  new tuned tongue instrument), which I have mentioned 
elsewhere, 
cymbals and synth. A visiting musician  from Sedona, AZ named Leonardo 
collaborated  on the construction of the Q  and played  the cymbals in 
this piece. 

Bill Wesley was featured in the next set. The first was a a virtuoso
performance on the "Rhythm Machine," a large array of infrasonically 
tuned, weighted metal tongues which rattle against fixed posts. This 
instrument has a wonderful clattering, chattering, rattling sound in 
Bill's hands. It is tuned in 4ths and octaves, but most of the
pitches are unaudiblly low and generate sounds by striking posts. It
was accompanied by Brian on synth and Glasier on a hand beaten drum.

Bill next performed on his "Nail Violin," an set of large and small
nails sticking out a resonator box. It is played by stroking the nail 
heads  with  rosin-coated fingers. The sound is somewhat reminiscent of 
the glass harmonica and ranged from flute-like tones to rather breathy
and raspy, string-like timbres. Glasier accompanied Bill on a synth in 
19-tet, using a variety of other timbres.

The next piece was 17-tet duet for guitar and synthesizer, the latter
ably played by Elizabeth Glasier. I may be wrong, but I think this is
her first appearance in SAG concerts.

Wesley returned to perform on his "Array Guitar," nine strings stretched
over a board with high frets metal frets. It is played by "hammering on," 
like the Stick, but the loose strings and high frets allow for wide pitch 
bending. The sound might be likened to "blues sitar."  BIll also played 
his "Array Slide," an out-sized slide guitar type of instrument and
demonstrated one of his multioctave polyphonic Kalimbas (Mbiras).

The final piece was the premier of Brian's "Microconcerto for Megalyra
and Synthesizer," in 19-tet. The solo passages were played live by Brian 
on Ivor Darreg's Megalyra (another slide guitar type of instrument)
while a computer and synth provided the orchestra. I found the orchestral
parts remininiscent of some of Brian's earlier 19-tone music, but he
says there was no conscious quotation. It is a very nice piece which I
am looking forward to hearing again soon on tape.

Ralph David Hill was in the audience. Some of you may recall his tapes 
on Just Intonation that are distributed by the JIN. He lives in San Diego 
now and has just gotten new and more powerful hardware for synthesis.
