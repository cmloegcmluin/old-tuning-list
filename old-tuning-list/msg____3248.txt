Subject: revisions to the Green Machine....

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

A few days ago I wrote this and I don't think I was very clear:

>Green Machine
>Ben Neill
>Astralwerks ASW 6159-2
>
>Ben Neill uses his MIDI muta-trumpet to create a

I think what I wanted to say was that I like what Neill (Ben) has 
done here. His compositional style fit right in with the ambient
movement. 

In fact he wrote in the Ambient email list in Nov. '95,
in response to a thread about 4/4 grooves:

>BN

And that's a better description then I could ever give.

Sorry for any confusion on my part.

I will go back to my room now.
