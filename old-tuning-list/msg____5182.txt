The most readable authoritative introduction to Indian classical music that
I've found is Bonnie Wade's Music in India: The Classical Traditions,
available in paperback from Prentice Hall.

I also like Neil Sorrell's Indian Music in Performance: A Practical
Introduction, written with Ram Narayan (NYU Press). Though less
comprehensive than Wade's, it is, as the title suggests, much more
practical, and comes with a cassette and transcriptions of performances.

The entry for "India" in the New Groves Dictionary is good, though
sometimes technical and a bit scattered. It also has a bibliography on
several specific topic areas, including areas such as folk music not
covered in these other sources.

A more technical book is Nazir Jairazbhoy's The Rags of North Indian Music,
but it has a very insightful analysis of the logic of ragas, including
their tuning. It also comes with a recording and transcriptions.

The older Western studies, including Danielou, Fox-Strangeways, and
Kaufmann, I wouldn't recommend to the beginning reader. Some of the
conclusions of Danielou in particular, though interesting, are not on
particularly sound scholarly footing. Kaufmann is useful as a reference
work.

As long as I'm at it, since this is the tuning list, the most important
work on the tuning of Indian music is by Mark Levy: Intonation in North
Indian Music. Unfortunately, it is published by a New Delhi publisher and
difficult to come by. I had to get it on interlibrary loan. I heartily
recommend it, though.

I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have other questions.
