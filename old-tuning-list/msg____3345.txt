Well, I think the boys at UXB,I are going to be disappointed to hear that. 
You know, I feel such a bond with Brother McLaren and Brother Moreno after 
those long marches in uniform and burnings of the sacred texts of 12-tone

Of course, a careful reading of Partch's showed that his creative fervor was 
solely for the betterment of Danlee Mitchell and Newband. Thanks for setting
