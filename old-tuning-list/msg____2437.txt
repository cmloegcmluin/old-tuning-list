   I'm not sure if I would go so far as to use the phrase "by far", but I
understand what Brian is getting at here.  Over all, I tend to agree.  But I
would like to put two caveats on that:  

   First, I found Paul's XH article to be very much worth reading, and a well
thought-out systemization of meaningful concepts (actually, I'm not quite done
reading it yet).  I have no doubt that Brian appreciates the value of Paul's
article as well, despite his constructive criticism.  

   Second, although my work with wildly 88CET and two other wildly
nontraditional tunings has taught me dramatically the value of "starting over",
I have found one very strong value from the 12-like tunings:  Quite often people
pay more attention if you present them with a composition that goes something
like...

"Normal Normal Normal Huh?! Normal Normal Normal Eeewww!" 

   rather than...

"Huh? Huh? Hmmmm.. What? Come again? Mmmmm? Say what?"
