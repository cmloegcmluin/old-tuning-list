Subject: K2000/K2500 Intonation opinions requested

From: john_loffink@ycrdi.com

I am seeking input from tuning list subscribers on a new feature for the
Kurzweil K2000/K2500 synthesizer/samplers.  The current operating systems for
these instruments does not change the pitch of currently sounding notes when
the intonation table is changed.  A forthcoming operating system upgrade may
change this to instantaneously change the pitch of all sustaining and
released notes when the intonation table is changed.  My questions are:

1.  How many members would like all notes to instantaneouly change in pitch?
2.  How many members would prefer to have the operating system remain as is
so that only new notes use the newly selected intonation table?

I have versed this as an either/or question because the K2000/K2500 User
Interface does not have space to select between the two options.  A feature
to select between instantaneous/new note only tuning would have to be a
"hidden function" and will take more time to implement.  In other words, if
the change IS implemented then current users who need the new notes only
version would not be able to upgrade their operating system.  Also, since the
K2000 is ROM based, it is unlikely that more than one operating system
upgrade will be released.  This is not an issue for the K2500 Flash ROM based
O.S.  No other aspects of the intonation handling will be changed with the
next upgrade.  It will still be limited to one system level intonation table
at a time.

I've used many intonation capable MIDI instruments, including the TX81Z,
DX7IIFD+E!, EPS, EPS-16 Plus and the K2500.  I believe the K2000/K2500 to be
one of the most flexible in this regard, and hope to help it continue to
evolve in its intonation capabilities.

If you have other requests for Kurzweil intonation features, I can't really
process them at this time but hope to do so at a future date.

Important:  If you send email directly to me, please use my Compuserve
account:  75023.2426@compuserve.com.  I will be moving in a few weeks from
Kurzweil in Massachusetts to a new job in  the southern U.S. and will not
receive any mail for the ycrdi.com address after that time.  I could be
offline as long as 3 or 4 weeks but hopefully will not lose any messages.  I
will still remain in contact with the Kurzweil group in regards to intonation
issues.
