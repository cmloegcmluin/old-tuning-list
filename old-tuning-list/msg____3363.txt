Subject: Re: The Reply, Part Last: Whither Harry...

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

"This thing began with the truth and truth does exist."
			Harry Partch (quoted by Jon Szanto)


The truth is Harry Partch promoted corporeality and his heir Danlee 
Mitchell performed *Revelation in the Courthouse Park* in Lincoln Center 
in total concert form, thereby giving the opposite impression of his mentor.

The truth is that Partch decried recordings for their abstract nature, 
while creating the Gate 5 label for his music, an early an successful Indie.'

The truth is that their are many versions of Harry Partch's music where 
instruments are exchanged and different music is substituted (e.g. 3 
versions of both Barstow and U.S. Highball).

The truth is that every performance of Partch since 1974 has been a 
variation.  The instruments, some held with rubber bands, have been 
updated, replaced, and even improved.  Still, Harry's voice is not 
recreateable and every performance demonstrates a difference.

The truth is that Newband issued a CD with transcriptions, even as Mr. 
Mitchell was railing against all such transcriptions, this one in 
particular, while insuring Mr. Drummond complete and absolute control.  
If only _Partch Instruments_ are used, and all competition is 
marginalized, then monopoly is achieved.  

The truth is that their is a morbid qualtiy to Mr. Partch and what might 
now be called his Bi-Polar personality.  The instruments were treated as 
having mortality like humans.  The cloud chamber bowls have no calculable 
way to be replaced, and the rubber bands examples of holding the 
corporeal body of the instrument together.

The truth is there is no other example in any other realm of art that 
follows the deamnds that the Mitchell/Szanto canon of Partchian ideology 
make...that I can think of.

The truth is I am on a single day off from a residency in upstate New 
York and have to get back for another week.  I could introduce Harry 
Partch to the youngsters, as I have many times before, or I can be 
intimidated by Mr. Mitchell's previous admonition to me against lecturing 
on Harry Partch as if I was a Partch scholar.

Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.
