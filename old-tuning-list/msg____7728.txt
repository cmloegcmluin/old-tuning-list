Here's what I've always said: "a" is preferable for describing the
resources of a given system of Just Intonations, and "b" is preferable
for describing the maximum interval complexity in simultaneities
considered consonant in a given style. The latter is very tied up with
an acoustical theory of interval perception.

I'm not sure what it is in my wording that was problematic. Perhaps you
could suggest an alternative wording for each of the interpretations you
mention, and I could endorse one, allowing us to proceed?

Again, the odd-limit definition applies not when considering all
intervals present, but when considering which intervals can be
considered consonant. In all your examples, the higher composites are
dissonant.

Equal temperaments or not, that has nothing to do with this issue.
