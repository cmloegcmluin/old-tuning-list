   }Now there's normally no realistic value in studying sound at the
}sub/atomic level, because everything about sound can be modeled many
orders
}of magnitude more simply at the macroscopic level of mechanics.  But
still,
}down at the level of fundamental forces, air-pressure is manifested by
}collisions of air molecules, and any form of collision is carried out
by
}repulsion between the electrons in the outer shells of those molecules.
}Electron repulsion is in turn carried out by photons.

Classically, two spherically symmetric neutral atoms would experience no
electrostatic forces even if separated by a very small distance.
Electron repulsion would be exactly balanced by attraction to the other
atom's nucleus. Quantum mechanically, this is not quite the case, and
you get the so-called Van der Walls forces which vary as the sixth or
twelfth power of the distance.

But it is the Pauli exclusion principle, not electrostatic or
electromagnetic interactions at all, which is responsible for collision
forces. Let's consider crystals, however, where it is not collisions
that transmit sound energy.

   }When I think about the classic experiments for illustrating the
}particle-wave duality of light, it's difficult for me to see any way to
}apply them to sound.  I can't imagine any way for example, that you
could
}get a particle-like distribution from the famous "two-slit" experiment
if
}conducted with sound rather than light.  But presumably that just means
}that I'm conducting an unrevealing experiment.

Single quanta of sound are extremely difficult to isolate in the
laboratory. By the formula E=H nu, you can see that the energy of a
phonon is astronomically smaller than the energy of a photon, which is
already so small that light energy was thought to come in continuous
quantities until this century.

I think that's enough physics for this list. E-mail me in person, or
better yet, go study quantum mechanics!
