But I need it to be connected directly because it's a consonant
interval.

The reason I like these lattice digrams is that they allow you to see
all the consonant combinations at a glance. According to John Chalmers,
Erv Wilson also uses higher-dimensional triangular lattices like these.

I would agree that stacking 5 notes in consecutive perfect fifths, one
hears a chord with a great deal of perfect-fifthness to it. The 81/64
itself is rather irrelavant. Maybe I picked too tautological an example.
Got a better one?

I think this is a great topic, but I don't think ratios of large numbers
have much to do with it. I do think that many blues performers do
distinguish between 6/5 and 7/6, however, as well as approaching a
pentatonic scale in 7tET.
