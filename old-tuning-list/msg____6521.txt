     Ok,   I have been holding off officially telling anybody on this list to
go order the CD, as the record company really got delayed on getting it
pressed.  However,  I am told that they will begin shipping this Wednesday.
     The CD  is "Beethoven In The Temperaments- Historical tunings on the
Modern Concert Grand".  It contains four Sonatas, ("Pathetique, op 14 no.1,
Moonlight, and Waldstein").  The first two are done on a Prinz( Kirnberger
III, and the second two are done on a Young(1799).
      The performer is Enid Katahn, a Steinway artist of many years and the
piano is the Steinway D at Blair School of music,  Vanderbilt University .
      I chose these pieces for their key, chronological order, and
relationships to each other; as the harmonic journey  through the keys
becomes more important when we have left 12 TET behind.
      I took a chance and began with the key of C#min (the Pathetique).   I
mean, if your gonna break the ice, use a big hammer.................
It is pretty dramatic to hear what a full syntonic comma sounds like on a
modern piano, and Beethoven shows  how to do it in the second movement.
 There is a lot of stuff, but I won't take the bandwidth here.
      I suppose Bach was a microtonalist, as he obviously was able to cope
with a variety of tuning systems.

The CD is going to be in stores, (or available) January 1,  but for those
that would make a Christmas present out of it,  it can be ordered  directly
from Gasparo's 1-800 number.   go to http://www.gasparo.com and you can see
it all.
   Thanks for asking, those that have heard it have all been struck by the
restoration of the "Character of the Keys"
