Subject: More xenharmonic vocal compositions

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

There is actually quite a bit of microtonal vocal music,
but most of it is hard to locate or privately distributed.
I imagine that Vyshnegradsky wrote some vocal music, but I
haven't heard it. Possibly Franz Richer Herf did as well.

Paul Rapoport's vocal pieces are published by Rudolf Rasch as
part of his Corpus Microtonale series of xenharmonic scores.
Paul's compositions are called "Songs of Fruits and Vegetables,"
(texts by Erica Jong). I believe "Tomato" has been re-written in
19-tet. 

Douglas Walker wrote some JI (theatre) pieces back in the 60's for 
John Grayson's ARC in Vancouver. I don't know if recordings 
exist. Doug?

Alois Haba` wrote an opera, Die Mu"tter, in 1/4-tones and it
was available as an LP from Supraphon. 

Julian Carrillo wrote an a cappella Mass for male chorus in 
1/4-tones, dedicated to Pope John the 23rd. It was recorded
by Phillips, I think.

His Preludio a Colon has  a soprano vocalise  in 1/4 and at least 
1/8th tones and I believe Tepepan also contains a microtonal vocalise.

Enrique Moreno has set a sacred text to one of the "Morenoctave" 
scales, I think, the 12th root of 3 (I don't have his dissertation 
handy at the moment).

Erling Wold has written and recorded some vocal music in JI
(JIN cassettes, CD's). I Weep and Music of Love are CD's. See the
JIN store for other possible JI vocal recordings.

Jon Fonville has composed some lovely settings of 4 of Sappho's
poems for voice and viola in ancient Greek tetrachordal modes.
These are in 7 and 11-limt JI's.

Henk Badings wrote "Contrasts, five songs for Mixed Choir" in 1952
in 31-tet. IT was recorded on a LP called Tricesimoprimal Music
from Holland.

Tui St. George Tucker has set three psalm texts for 1/4 ensemble
and baritone. These have been recorded on LP.

Ive's song "Like a Sick Eagle" uses quarter-tones. It sounds
vertiginous, however.

Gary David and Alyce and Rhae Andrece put out a partly microtonal 
album of jazz (The Sound of Feeling) using one of Erv Wilson's 
instruments 
and some of his concepts back in the early 70's or even late 60's. 
Star Trek fans may remember the Andrece twins from the episode "Mudd's 
Women," in which they played female androids. Erv used to train them
and Gary to sing hexanies and other JI structures quantized to 41-tet
(on a guitar).
