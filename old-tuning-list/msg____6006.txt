I'd be happy to continue the discussion.  I remember some stuff
about 9 being a coordinate direction, a recipe for saturated chords,
and an argument about octave invariance that did reach some kind of
conclusion.

Anyway, to my question:

Looking back through the archive, I see you (Paul) covered these
in March:

Whatever "doubly positive" means, the scales you mentioned are
the ones I thought didn't work.  I wanted a 0-comma scale to
be just, preferably Pythagorean, but I can see now that there's
no problem with having tritones in there.   I've had a good
look at them, but I haven't worked out the 7-limit approximation
yet.  Can you help here?

Getting back to Paul's message:

Thanks for using my notation.  Setting (11 -4 -2)H to zero
using the method I outlined on the list before gives this
temperament.  The defining matrix has a determinant of -2, which
is where the tritones come from.

As regards srutis, are these ancient or medieval in origin?
The document defining Sa- and Ma-grama on a 22 note scale seems
to me to be the earliest clearest record of 5-limit diatonic
outside of Europe.  I welcome corrections on this.
