"Gary's observations that synthetic instrumental sounds with integer
harmonic spectra are satisfactory substitutes does illustrate how other
aspects of sound - particularly the envelope - may be equally or more
critical to our recognition of a sound.

-------------------- End Original Message --------------------

   There are plenty of really interesting examples of envelopes and other
aspects of a sound producing a greater feeling of recognition than overtone
structure.  One that pops into mind is the ol' Rhodes electric piano. 
Since it uses (more or less) piano hammers to strike tuning forks, it
produces a quintessentially piano-like envelope with an equally
quintessentially NON-piano-like overtone structure.  

   But even beyond that, strictly-harmonic equivalents of most orchestral
intruments are far to similar with their "real" counterparts for attack
transients, vibrato characteristics, or even noise characteristics, to be
attributable to this phenomenon.
