Everyone;
    John S. Allen, inventor of the Notebender keyboard, has a web page with
info on music keyboard design with a section on generalized keyboard design.
 Link titles on his page include:

Improving the Musical Instrument Keyboard
MIDI editing/Cakewalk for Windows
On Rabbits, Mathematics and Musical Scales
Notation for Microtonal Scales, Part 1

I urge everyone to have a look at
