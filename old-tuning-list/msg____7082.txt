Subject: Electronic tuner ad JI

From: Alexandre Enkerli <enkerli@iname.com>

Hello to all!
I was practicing with an electronic tuner and was thinking about just
intervals and how to practice them.
I play tenor in a classical saxophone quartet, so I'm used to thirds. But
trying to tune them with an electronic tuner isn't that obvious. So I
wanted to calculate how to calibrate the tuner to give me a just third at
440Hz. What I calculated was around 443.6 so I guess 444 will do fine but
I'd be glad to hear some advice from you.
BTW, what do you think of available automatic tuning software such as
Frequency Meter, Oscilloscope 2.0 and the "Perfect Pitch" products?
Obviously, a software JI tuner could be a very practical tool for some of
us. I wonder why it should be *that* complicated to do.
Apart from that, I'm currently playing with a Malian musician who tunes
the six-strings of his instrument (a harp-lute similar to the kora) in
something similar to the second mode of a major pentatonic scale but I
haven't been able to precisely check his tuning. Apart from checking each
string with an electronic tuner (which seems somewhat unscientific), what
method would you recommend?
Anyway, TIA for any help.
