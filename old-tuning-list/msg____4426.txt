I love the barborshop quartet sound, but I haven't actually sung it, nor sequenced 
it myself. 

About midi and microtones, pitch-bend tweaking is too much trouble. I admire the 
stamina of people who can do it that way. I prefer to tune the instrument (Yamaha 
DX7-II in my case) rather than the sequence file (pitch bend events). That way, I 
get all the polyphony on the same midi channel, and I can play it manually as well. 
I can also build scales by ear, without preplanning, one new note at a time, tuning 
it against the notes I've already tuned. That kind of trial-and-error process using 
pitch-bend tweaking on multiple midi channels would be horrendous.

Great, thanks! Could you send them again and attach them as files rather than as 
coded text please? (If you're using Netscape Navigator for Win95, click "As is" 
rather than "Convert to Plain Text" in the Attachments window.) I'm ignorant of 
how to handle the text versions.

There must be many good ways to interpret a just tuning setting for a piece where 
the notation is originally in 12tet. I may have some ideas once I listen, but 
probably not criticisms.
