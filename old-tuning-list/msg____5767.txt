Subject: Octave invariance revisited

This is clearly wrong in that the property is also shared by
ratios like 1:3.  My thanks to the people who pointed this out.

When I wrote this I was thinking of ratios as restricted to a
single octave, including both endpoints, even though I cited an
example of a trans-octave ratio in the next paragraph--clearly an
example of muddy writing and probably muddy thinking.

I think that it remains true that there is an important acoustic
division between repeating patterns of sound pressure.  Some have
zero energy in the fundamental, and will thus mostly be heard as
chords, and those with an appreciable amount of energy in the
fundamental will mostly be heard as a single note.

Possible exceptions would be the examples like 15:1 where there
is a wide gap between the fundamental and a higher harmonic.

I have been reading Partch again a little.  I still find myself
put off by the man's style.  It seems to me that making a big
deal of whether the numerator or denominator of an interval is
odd is wallowing in irrelevancy.

I also find his practice of representing scales and chords with
the 1/1 ratio in the middle somewhere to be strange.

All, in all, I have found his book to be useful source of
historical information, but I still question the usefulness of
his theories.
