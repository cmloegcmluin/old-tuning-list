Subject: Re: 15-week course on tunings, proposal

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

It would certainly be interesting to present the curriculum you outlined and 
see what results appear.  Perhaps the materials and their order might be 
rearranged based on age levels.  Also, a list of listening materials that 
correspond to each and every lesson might be adviseable.

Most important is the real time singing of intervals, perhaps a new 
interval each and every lesson.  Further lessons would allow for review.  
Playing and composing need not be excluded as higher level skills: tunes 
and harmonies experienced all would have more emotional impact.  
Emotional memory is supposed to be the strongest form of memory we have.
