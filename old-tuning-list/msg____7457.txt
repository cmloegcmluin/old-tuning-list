Subject: fretboards again

From: Steven  Rezsutek <steven.rezsutek@hq.nasa.gov>

Ach... I feel stupid, and there's no cancel-bot...

Re my previous fretting over frets:

I did a little experimentation when I got home and realised that
trying to make a fretboard with routerbits and rods and such is a big
step [can you say "understatement"?] up from the saw and hammer and
wire approach.  Talk about biting off more than I could have chewed!
Anyhow, bag that idea -- I'm sure some of you could pull it off, but
if it were within my grasp, I'd have built an instrument to put it on
by now.  Even then, I've no way of knowing whether a board made from
all those little precision-cut pieces glued together would even
be "worth it".   

See -- I wasn't kidding when I said I'd hit my limits, though I guess
I should add understanding the nature of my materials to that. Guess
I'll stay with the tried and true (though I'm still interested in
whether there's stainless fretwire out there).

Always open for ideas and suggestions of any kind, though.

Thanks,

Steve
