From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Contrary to Mr. Szanto's assertions, I neither ignored nor 
miscomprehended Mr. Partch's oeuvre.  Once again, the use of the 
synthesizer for the Chromelodion was discussed as acceptable by Danlee 
Mitchell over the phone - the only possible substituion allowable.  Mr. 
Drummond's hoarding of the instruments is not related at all to this useage.

Additionally, the AFMM uses its own Kithara built at a cost of $1,000 by 
Skip La Plante, and uses an guitar "better" than Partch could hope for, 
as is its player.  Dean's regular performance of 2 Studies on Ancient 
Greek Scales for zoomoozophone and flute, and its recording on CD - 
contrary to Danlee and company - belies the fury that keeps Partch under 
wraps, unless it is by the blessed few who worked with Partch directly.

Non-corporeal performances by Mr. Mitchell at Lincoln Center flies in the 
face of further criticisms.  And the value of the synthesizer (which was 
unavailable to Partch) in performing "all the notes written" by the 
composer for his music adds an improved dimension - if only the music was 
listened to, rather than talked about.

McLaren was incorrect in stating that Dean Drummond has refused lending 
or renting the AFMM instruments for any "stated" reason, as I previously 
posted.  When I called him to repair an adapted viola, he refused.  When 
I reminded him that I had recommended he make a new surrogate kithara and 
chromolodeon due to their inferior sound quality (using a $50,000 grant 
for that purpose) he did just that, using Mr. Hackelman at my 
recommendation.  3 years afterwards Mr. Drummond claims to have forgotten 
his asking for said reccomendation.

The sentimentality for Partch's mortality undercuts his role as a 
composer in this country.  Mr. Szanto - a fantastic bass marimba player - 
should have been involved with east coast performances, he was missed.  
At this time there is a monopoly on his instruments as a result of 
territoriality and protectionism.  It should not be too surprising - had 
the same problem with the Charles Ives Society.  That one worked through 
a bit better, thankfully.

Danlee Mitchell does not believe that Partch's music holds up without the 
exact instruments formerly in his possession being used.  He wrote me on 
March 7, 1987, effectively derailing my planned productin of King Oedipus,
"I do not recall saying that I approved of Dean performing this work (2 
Studies on Ancient Greek Scales) on flute and zoomooxophone(sp), and if I 
did I take it back.  It should be performed on HC and BM--nothing else!"  
Several years later, and with original instruments in Dean's possession, 
it was released on Mode Records.  Sorry, Jon, no dice.
