Subject: Greek theorists

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Aristoxenos wrote around 320 BCE, Archytas about 375-390. Euclid's
geometry dates from about 300 and Ptolemy's Harmonics were
written about 160 CE. 

The heyday of the Pythagoreans was more like early 5th or late 6th 
century than 3rd or 4th. By the time of Archytas, irrationals were well 
known. He was the first to describe three the simplest means as important 
for music, the three being the arithmetic, harmonic and geometric, the 
latter, of course, creates irrationals in most cases.

The geometrical algebra of the later geometers is really impressive.
See Heath's 2 volume "A History of Greek Mathematics" for more details 
than you'll probably want.
