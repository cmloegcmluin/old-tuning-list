Subject: Water Music

From: "J. Pusey" <pusey@remqhi.ENET.dec.com>

Marcus,

The movements 1 and 2 of "Water Music", along with Schottstaedt's piece
"Dinosaur Music", are available on a CD from Wergo (WER 2016-50) also entitled
"Dinosaur Music". In the US, I had to special order my copy directly from the
importer, Harmonia Mundi USA (it does not appear to be available in stores).
I'd also like to hear movements 3 and 4 of "Water Music", but I don't know
if they are available on CD. The "Dinosaur Music" disc is relatively expensive,
but I enjoy it very much.
