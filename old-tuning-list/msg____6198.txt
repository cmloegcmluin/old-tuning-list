Subject: dynamic JI

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl

I was wondering why no one doing dynamic intonation seems to make use
of research in the area of automatic key recognition of music. There
is work done by Jamshed J. Barucha who uses a connectionist model
which for example can also detect when the key is ambiguous. Other
work in this regard did H. John Maxwell. He proposed a set of 55 rules
to answer the two questions: Which vertical sonorities are chords? and
What is the key?
I presume these methods can be used as input to a dynamic intonation
algorithm, but to my knowledge this hasn't been done yet. Judgeing
from these papers however it looks quite difficult to capture the
abstract state called key in a set of fixed methods. Though Maxwell
has come rather close.
Perhaps there are advantages if dynamic intonation methods would also
try to identify cadences instead of focusing on how to get chords in
tune, for other music than chorales or so.
