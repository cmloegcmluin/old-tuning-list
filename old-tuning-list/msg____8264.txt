Yeeha...just finished typing the liner notes; as soon as I get a spare 
hour or two, I'm off to the graphics guy to get it rolling. All dat's are 
in, same deal..just need some time. Summertime as a working/single dad is 
really busy...it will get done soon...I am honored to be working with 
such a talented bunch, believe me...this is going to be a great 
project...Hstick
