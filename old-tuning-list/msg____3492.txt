Subject: ICMC, Tuning List, Linus Liu

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I just returned from the ICMC 96 meeting in Hong Kong, where, I am happy to
report, more than a dozen members of the tuning list were present. It was 
a great pleasure to finally meet people such as Bill Sethares, Greg 
Taylor, Eric Lyon, Greg Schiemer, John Fitch, Linus Liu, and several 
others with 
whom I had corresponded  or whose names I had seen on the Tuning List. I
had a great time at the meeting and took a post-conference trip to Bangkok
for a couple of days and just got back to San Diego. As a result, I'm
(dis)oriented and somewhat decerebrate today. 

On behalf of Phil Burk, Larry Polansky, Bill Sethares, and myself, I 
would 
like to especially thank Linus Liu for his hospitality and assistance. 
Linus, who lives in the New Territories, took all of us to a store which 
sells traditional Chinese musical instruments (as well as pianos and  
violins). The store is near the Sheung Wan MTR stop, but it is not very 
obvious and we would have never found it on our own. Various of us bought 
erhu_s, sho_s, and a gong (LP). P'ip'a_s, sheng_s, flutes, banjos and 
other 
instruments were available at quite low prices.
