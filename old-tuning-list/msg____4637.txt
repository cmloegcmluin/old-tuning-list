My conversations with Jim and La Monte Young in Krems, and with Jim later
in Frankfurt last year suggested that both were very much more flexible on
this issue than your remark indicates. ''Musical fiction'' is an extremely
curious phrase to use. ''Music-theoretic fiction'' is more plausible, but I
have no idea what terms of reference are construed as fiction and fact by
this statement. The fact remains that /4:/5:/6 is a description of a set of
frequency relationships that is extremely useful, while the equivalent
harmonic description (in lowest terms: 10:12:15) is misleading when applied
to any real musical contexts of which I am aware.

Do you really hear a just minor triad as being built a Major third above an
absent fundamental?
