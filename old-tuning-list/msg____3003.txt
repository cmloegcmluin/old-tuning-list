Subject: Frog Peak Web, Rankin

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I recently checked out Frog Peak Music's new WEB page at
http://www.sover.net/~frogpeak/. I have to use Lynx, which
prevents me from enjoying the graphics and color, but even
so, it is  most impressive.  I urge all of you with WEB access
to visit it ASAP.

It's a wonderful resource for microtonal music, Gamelan, and other
types of experimental and non-traditional musics, so check it out.  

FPM's philosophy and mission is best expressed in its own words: 

	"Frog Peak Music is dedicated to exploring innovative 
technologies 
	and aesthetics of publication and distribution, and committed 
	to the idea of availability over  promotion.  Member artists 
	determine which of their own works are included in Frog Peak 
	Music, and how  they are included. Frog Peak Music perpetuates 
	and evolves the historical role of experimental independent 
	publishing in the United  States. By doing so, it engenders a 
	hospitable publication environment for its members, and provides 
	an example of some of the ways that artists might control their 
	own work in a non-commercial, non-hierarchical fashion, erasing 		
distinctions between artist and publisher."

The site  contains a complete catalogue of books, scores, recordings 
and journals, including Balungan (published by the American Gamelan 
Institute), and, all  modesty  aside,  Xenharmonikon and "Divisions of
the Tetrachord."  Back issues of Peter Garland's Soundings  and the 
Lingua Press books are also available. (I've mentioned only a very few 
of the items available)

Featured artists include Warren Burt, Ivor Darreg, Carter Scholz, 
Lou Harrison, Phil Burk, Martin Bartlett, Ann LaBerge, Larry Polansky, 
Dan Wolf, Gayle Young and  many, many others.  (Pace Brian, there
is even an Ivor Darreg subpage.)


To change the subject:

Mark Rankin called me last night to enquire if there was some way he 
could post an "ad" or notice to some WEB or internet site. He sells kits 
for converting 12-tet guitars (or other fretted instruments)  to 
Interchangeable Fretboard instruments and  he also sells extra custom 
fretboards. Anyway, does anyone know of such a site or list and its 
location? Mark is also a JI performer and music theory bibliophile/
bibliomane.
