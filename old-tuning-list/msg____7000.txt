I think this is fairly common.  There's no standard way of
assigning them, but there doesn't need to be!


My tuning priorities are:

1) At least 1/64 semitone steps
2) A full keyboard table
3) The ability to transpose that table differently for each channel
4) At least 0.1 cent steps
5) Multiple tables, easily swapped
6) More than one table active at a time

The TX81Z fulfils the first 3 criteria.  The AWE64 Gold fulfils
all except (4) but, until Fred writes the supporting software, it
isn't easy to set up.

The TX81Z also has a good key velocity response, and the timbre
can change gradually as you go up the keyboard.  If there are
sample based synths that can do this, they must be difficult to
program.  The people who complain about digital synthesis should
really try FM.  It's gone out of fashion because most people don't
program it right, and it's no good for imitating other instruments.
In terms of expressivity and versatility, though, it's unsurpassed
in my experience -- which is, admittedly, fairly limited.
