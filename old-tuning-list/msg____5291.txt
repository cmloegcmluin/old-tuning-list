   Perhaps you're saying the same thing in a different way, but the picture
in the web page, shows the apparent instrument broken on both ends at
toneholes, with only two completely intact toneholes between the break
points.  The distance between the two intact toneholes is clearly much
larger than the distance between the end-most intact toneholes and the
break points.

   That does seem to suggest that it played a unequal scale, but what that
scale may be is hard to be sure of without having the embouchure hole
intact.
