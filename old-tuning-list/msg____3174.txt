Subject: just vocal music

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

You may enjoy listening to a set of collections of the winners of the 
yearly competition of the Society for the Preservatiojn of Barbershop 
Singing in America called "The Old Mill Stream". A new one is available 
each year and they may be had at more complete record stores. I have 
several, and some of the groups cultivate a vibratoless style that 
emphasizes beatless 6th 7th and 9th chords. The material is corny, but 
when they are "on a blend" the effect can be breathtaking.
	On a slightly different note, does anyone know how train horns 
are tuned? My office is near the tracks, and I frequently hear beatless 
chords from these train horns. Is there a little old German man in a 
shed with an oscilloscope, or what?
