Greetings all, =0A         Earlier posted was a question if Bach may have=
 tuned his instrument=0Ain ET when playing with Lutes.  I have taken the =
position that ET wasn't=0Apossible, even with the ear of the genius appli=
ed, because of the difficulty=0Ain getting it even near right without lat=
ter-day techniques.  =0A       I think that Jorgensen's writings support =
this, and will quote him=0Ahere,  for the consideration of those that (ri=
ghtfully), don't go along with=0Athis "jes' cause ol' Foote said so....."=
  =0AFrom "Tuning", Jorgensen writes;=0A=0A"=85=85 we must conclude that=
 equal temperament as we know it was not tuned=0A=0Aon pianos during the =
19th century.  A study of the instructions for=0A=0Atuning given in the p=
resent book (by A. J. Ellis who invented the cent=0A=0Ameasurement)  for =
the years through 1885 verifies that essential=0A=0Aacoustical informatio=
n for tuning equal temperament was lacking.  This=0A=0Awas one reason for=
 the 19th century tuners=92 inability to tune equal=0A=0Atemperament by e=
ar.  Other deviation was due to the basic concepts of=0A=0Atuning then in=
 vogue.  19th century tuning by ear was a highly developed=0A=0Aart based=
 on aesthetic judgments for every tone, and test chords were=0A=0Aused mo=
re than test intervals.  By contrast, 20th century tuning is a=0A=0Amathe=
matical skill."=0A     My own experience bears this well.  I can't tune m=
y old familiar ET=0Awithout the use of test intervals that were developed=
 long after Bach.  =0A(Now, I am really thinking of cracked chestnuts....=

hville, Tn.  =0AP.s.  We are beginning to consider music for a second "In=
 The Temperaments"=0ACD, and are finding that composers  later than Beeth=
