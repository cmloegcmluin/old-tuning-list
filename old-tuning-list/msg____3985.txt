Subject: Re: From Brian McLaren (the WWW bites!)

From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu>

<sigh> I know I'm going to regret this, but here are a few points about
Brian's 500-line rant on the WWW.

      * Everything Brian said about webpage design is perfectly well
	known and available in any number of books, tutorials, websites,
	and classes offered by numerous institutions.  Unfortunately
	good design principles do not carry the force of law, so don't
	expect a reduction in the percentage of crappily-made pages
	anytime soon.

      * Wendy Carlos _does_ check her email; she just doesn't answer it
	individually.  Instead she adds responses to questions of
	general interest to her Open Letters.  (I know; she answered one
	of mine.)  And, BTW, her background, while it does affect
	legibility a bit, is a very clever Inversion (a la Scott Kim)
	which turns her first name into a plane-filling tessellation.  I
	like it.

      * Why harp on bad search engines?  Ignore them and use the better
	ones; evolution in action.  Plus, once you find _one_ good site
	on a subject, they usually have pointers to other good ones.
	There's a bunch of great stuff you can get to from the Just
	Intonation Network's site, for example.  (Including a chapter
	from their JI primer.)

      * Usually the person who cares most about something getting done
	is the logical person to do it.  If Brian, as seems to be the
	case, cares so much more than the rest of us about building the
	Ultimate Tuning Site On The Web, then I say sincerely what he
	said sarcastically: maybe it's up to him.

      * The rest of us, though (since we're not _totally_ apathetic),
	would probably be more willing to give him our support,
	assistance, and cooperation if he weren't so obnoxious about it.
	But we've beaten that horse before.
