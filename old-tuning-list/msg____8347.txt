It may be obvious to some, but a number of people on this list have
concerned themselves with consistency in tunings such as 768-tET, and
since consistency requires the best approximation to be used for each JI
interval, those people probably have not considered the alternative of
using different approximations for the same just interval at different
pitch levels. This underscores my point that consistency (which was my
idea in the first place) is not important for large ETs, say, above
69-tET.
