Subject: the beat goes on

are percieved as 100.5 with a beat rate of 1. First how can this be 
meaused.

This is a standard result in psycho-acoustics. For instance,
there's an extended description and a couple of figures describing it 
in Roederer's book (Physics and Psychophysics of Music).

On page 31 there is a footnote: 

How do we verify that, indeed, the pitch sensation of the resulting 
tone does correspond to a tone of frequency f1+delta f/2? This is 
accomplished with pitch matching experiments: the subject is 
presented alternatively with a reference tone of controllable pitch 
and is requested to "zero in" the frequency of the latter until he 
senses "equal pitch" with respect to the original tone.
