Subject: Elitism

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Seems like Neil Haverstick and I pretty much agree on this subject in 
what he wrote recently.

A few additional comments. First, I'd say there is a great deal of 
humanity and passion in Schoenberg's serial music. Also, complexity may 
not have as much to do with the issue as it seems, because at least so 
far as I know, there are no measures of it in music.

And, to go out on a limb--so far out that Neil may be sharpening his
saw--I will say that for me, classical music is what I want to hear most. 
In some aspects I think that it is often superior--in some aspects only.
BUT that is my upbringing and preference only; it does not invalidate
others' preferences and abilities, and it is not absolute.  Classical
music is also not what I listen to 100% of the time, and I have been
vigorous in my support of other music. For Neil and others are surely
right that the division into kinds of music, flaky at times, has in any
case nothing to do with quality or importance. 

Inherently I don't deal with things that are in any sense popular, but 
that is my choice. Xenharmonics certainly fit that choice and probably 
always will, even when Neil and others bring other tunings to the rest of 
the world in the way that is certainly most important--performance.
