Subject: Tuning into the FUTURE.

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

Next step in tuning???  D a v i d B e a r d s l e y .. dmb5561719@aol.com and
others seem to have again fallen into the "What's the best tuning system for
the future?" conundrum.  I read calls for reversion to the old Just
Intonation model, yet see little JUSTification except the traditional, and
"muddle-headed" quest for non-beating intervals.  David's impatience could be
the result of "barking up the wrong tree".  Instead of looking for only a
tuning system, let's consider this as a quest for a complete system, method,
or paradigm for mapping what Erv Wilson poetically calls "tone space".  What
are the requirements for such a system for the future?  I propose that they
should:  (Pitch Mapping) * be applicable to all and every musical instrument,
sound,
  and previous music.  * be able to map any interval to known levels of
precision.  * Avoid any bias towards any particular integer or rational
number sequence (Harmony, Scales, and Coding) * allow any number of
conceivable intervals and arrange additions in patterns
  of progressively increasing dissonance.  * be able to map scales in an
unambiguous way, which provides clear
  codification, analysis and synthesis; and plot consonance and dissonance
  in a simple way.  (Notation) * enable any music from the past, as well as
the future,
  to be interpreted, emulated, represented and played.  * be clear,
unambiguous and, evolving from traditional notation, which also
  express "harmonic" structure.  (Conversion) * provide a clear, logical, and
easy route for novices to evolve and
  progress beyond traditional musical education, notation, instruments,12tET,
  and other systems.  * easily reprocess existing midi files.  (Time) *
provide a compatible and related rhythm and tempo system.  (Color coding) *
contain a practical pitch to color system, for synaesthetic visual
  representation, for immediate scale, key, and pitch reference and training.
(Geometry) * move beyond Platonic solids to spherical conceptualisation.  I
believe that I have found such a universal system, with large (L) and small
(s) intervals, derived from pi;  and am continuing to develop its potential.
If you'd like to know more, please check out the LucyTuning websites starting
from http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy.  You may argue with my failure to conform
to classical acoustic theory, yet can anyone honestly claim that any other
tuning system can fulfill ALL these requirements?  BTW Any webmasters wanting
relevant URL link exchanges, please EMail me (lucy@hour.com) with your URL
and any suggestions of which page you would like me to link it from, and to.
http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy Update on activities:  Having discovered that
LucyTuned Lullabies work, we are now exploring the use of LucyTuning to
further influence listeners decisions, and beginning to develop the use of an
enhanced technology for even more adventuruous commercial applications.  Stay
Tuned!  lucy@hour.com Monday 8th Dec 1997. London UK.
