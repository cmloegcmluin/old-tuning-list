Subject: Microtuning Yamaha FM synths

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hello Everyone,

I've been racking my brains and searching the net for a solution to my 
quest for an accurate  real-time microtuning synth.I use software 
synthesis to finally realise a composition,but for the initial  process 
of  composing,I need a real-time  system. 

I considered using samples indivually tuned,but it's too tedious & not 
flexible.

One possibility I thought of follows.I don't know if it will work as I 
have never used a Yamaha FM synth,so I'm hoping someone can shed some 
light.

-Since the carrier frequency can be specified in hertz (I hope it can, 
along with floating point no.s,anyone here know ?)
, it should be possible to tune one accurate note per MIDI 
channel,thereby giving 16 notes on a 16-part synth like the SY/TG-77 & 
SY-99.then depending on how fast these synths respond to program change 
messages ( anyone here know how fast in ms ?) ,it could be possible to 
obtain all neccessary pitches/notes.

It would require real-time MIDI proccessing using something like MAX to 
build an application that 
had the neccessary user-specified intelligence to know when to send pgm 
changes,and on what channels depending on which are occupied and what 
tuning you are using.It would also possible to assign notes from your 
controller to do specific things.

I would appreciate any advise and insights,perhaps from anyone who has 
tried this.

On a related note,I think it's a shame that there are barely any current 
synths that are actual synths and not actually glorified sample-playback 
devices.


Cheers,
Drew
