Subject: Brian's 17-tet modes

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Manuel: You are correct. After I posted the note, Brian told me
that he had made a couple of errors, but he didn't think they ]
would be too confusing. The essential point of his paper was that
non-diatonic, non-MOS (2 interval pattern), non-"chromatic"
(in the 12-tet sense) scales are musically useful in these systems.
I do not see that these scales fall into any of the usual classes,
though his descending 19-tet scale is an impropoper MOS whose
generator is 4 degrees of 19.
