Subject: Brian McLaren

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

I received a letter from Brian stating that he would not be reachable by
mail in Oregon until the end of February, as he has gone to southern Cal. 
for the time. John Chalmers, when he gets a minute, may have a suggestion
on how to reach him, since he is often near San Diego. It would be a shame
not to thank Brian for that series on psychoacoustic matters, regardless
of how much one agrees or disagrees with his reporting or conclusions. 

I'm not sure Brian doesn't *believe* in telephones, I mean he's been known 
to use one, but Gary is right in that he doesn't apparently have one in 
Oregon and does prefer written communication.

Maybe we could convince him to get a phone but leave it hooked up to a 
modem permanently...and thus accept e-mail but no voice-mail...
