Subject: just steel guitar, Shockwave and Justonics

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

T. Sage Harms (3215 Lyndale Avenue South;  Minneapolis, MN  55408;  USA)
wrote an article in Steel Guitar World magazine issue #12, concentrating
mostly upon pythagorean tuning on the steel guitar.  Perhaps that's a
start.  

   As for the status of Justonic Tuning's software products, I *think* that
it's not quite out yet, because they offered to let me beta-test it.  


   Please forgive me if I sound overpicky or whatever, but I think
personally that we ought to be cautious of substituting "pure" for "just". 
If we already have a term for a concept, I think we'd be better off not add
synonyms to the terminology soup.  

   Or perhaps John S. was just using the word more as a generic adjective
rather than as a synonym for "just"?  

   In the El Paso gig, Neil H. pointed out that he likes "pure" over "just"
on the grounds that it's a better description of the concept.  Well, that
may be a matter of perspective.  

   "Pure" is reasonable from the perspective of "beatless" harmony, but
some might argue that just intonation is less "pure" from the perspective
of having varying melodic whole- and half-step sizes in a diatonic
framework.  Perhaps that's a short-sighted argument, but still I think that
terminology ought to be based as much as possible upon historical
precedent.  As far as I know there is no historical precedent for a
specific meaning for the word "pure" in tuning theory.  

   What does everybody else think?
