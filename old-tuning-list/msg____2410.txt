Subject: File with equal temperaments info

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

There is a file that I've put at 
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/et_data.zip
with information about equal octave divisions from 6 to 612 tones ET.
It includes step size, the nearest approximations to 5/4, 3/2 and 7/4,
Fokker's misfit number, the Pythagorean thirds, number of recognisable
fifths, the sizes of semitones and several commas in number of steps,
the number of cycles of fifths and thirds and various possible
distributions of the major diatonic scale (5 larger + 2 smaller
intervals), two 12-note scales and other major modes and their
propriety (proper, strictly proper, or not). 
The file is in zip-format, unzip it with the -a option for ASCII file 
to prevent problems with the carriage-return character.
The size is 691 Kb, after unzipping 6.1 Mb.
