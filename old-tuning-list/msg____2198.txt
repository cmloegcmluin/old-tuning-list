Subject: New xenharmonic CD
---
"Ping-Pong Anthropology," by The 13th Tribe, is yet
another microtonal CD by yet another world music 
group well worth hearing.
In this case the members of the avant ensemble are:
Erik Balke, a Norwegian folk musician and student of
African and Balinese music; Werner Durand, a German
and Silvia Ocougne, a Brasilena.
Balke and Durand perform on harmonic-series PVC pipes
while Ocougne uses prepared acoustic guitars whose
strings are hammered, plucked and pulled.  Skin drums
and plexiglas tubes are also used.
The music uses a "call and answer" technique in
combination with digital delays, and the result is
something like ethnic music for a tribe of children
living in the rafters of a geodesic dome.  The first
track, "Dream Hunters," along with track 3, "Hazar," and 
track 7, "Ping-Pong Anthropology," are particularly
memorable.  All three performers (along with French
guest perfomer Pierre Berthet on tracks 8 & 9) use
higher members of the harmonic series to weave
extended melodies.  The effect is reminiscent of some
of the earlier compositions of Denny Genovese, although
with greater rhythmic density and a concommitant use
of digital electronics to generate a sleet of ricocheting
"ghost" notes.
This CD is available for a limited time from Experimental
Intermedia.  Not nearly as expensive as you'd expect
for an import--about $17.  Highly recommended.
