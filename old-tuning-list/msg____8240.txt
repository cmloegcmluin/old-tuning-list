Subject: Software for using MIDI Pitch Bends

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hello,

Thanks Graham.

Oh.

>What's "Megalomania" then?
"Megalomania 1.2.3  (shareware/freeware)
The application allows the user to design "effects" that process MIDI 
data in realtime.
The user designs an effect by connecting icons in a modular network, 
similar to some
software synthesizers.  An icon represents a simple computation (delay, 
transposition,
etc...) and the connections represent the flow of MIDI data."

etc.

Available at <www.harmonycentral.com> . Haven't tried it yet myself. 
It's a 68k app. (not PPC native) and uses MIDI manager.

I'm surprised RealTime Tuner (I have v1.1) ,etc. has not been expanded to
do fancier things, including non-octave based tunings, dynamic 
intonation, etc.
If I had Max I would have put something together myself. I'm at work on
non real-time thingies using IRCAM's PatchWork. I don't know how to get 
in 
touch with the RealTime Tuner  folks, maybe they'll see this .

On the PC there's Graham's stuff and Manuel's Scala. There is the option 
of
Virtual PC . Oi,  Greg (Schiemer), did you get Scala and VPC to gel ? 
Let us know if you did/do. Frankly the thought of trying to get
a Mac-Windows  spaghetti  to come out smelling right  in 
the same machine scares me.


Salut,
Drew
