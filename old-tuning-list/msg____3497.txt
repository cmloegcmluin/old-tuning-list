I don't know what you mean. Can you elaborate? This is what I mean. Take C 
major, a common diatonic scale. As usually defined, it has six consonant 
triads: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am. These triads are in fact consonant when 12-, 
19-, 31-tET, or meantone temperament is used to tune the scale. In all of 
these cases, G B D F will be dissonant, and in meantone or 31-tET, a closer 
approximation to a 4:5:6:7 chord built on G can be found than that which 
arises from the diatonic scale. That chord is notatod G B D E#. However, 
this chord will not sound correct in C major, despite its acoustical purity: 
the note "F" is expected, and an out-of-tune version is put in its place. In 
addition, the "clash" in G B D F is essential to the feeling that it needs 
to resolve to the tonic chord, C E G.
