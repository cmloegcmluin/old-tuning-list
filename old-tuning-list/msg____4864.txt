Patience Matt! This is only the first stage.
I see that you expect everything to be laid out on a plate for you.
Let's add the note names to this simple table of results. 
 
Original was:

More info. added to above:
 
The values below are from A2 string (110Hz.)

 33       E3   164         V       330         E4       V   * 2
 25       D3   147        IV       440         A4       VIII * 2
 20       C#3  137       III       550         C#5      III  * 4
 17       C3   132      bIII       660         E5       V    * 4
 
 
! NB. The * represents multiplied by frequency 
(i.e to give indication of octave)
 
 
So the notes which we produce produce from this are
A, C#, and E.
 
The Spiral of fourths and fifths runs:
 
A E B F# C# in one direction (Vths)
A D G C F Bb in the other.   (IVths).
 
 
So the ghosttones give us two new pitches in the fifths
direction E Vth and its octaves and
          C# III two ocatves higher.
 
Remember A-C#-E  I-III-V (a major chord).
Now all we need to do is ascertain the "exact" value
of either the III or the Vth interval and we have the
tuning defined.
 
By now resetting the string pitch we can generate all the
other notes that we need, and we find that the fret positions
match the touching positions as closely as we can measure.
 
Hence as we know that IVth plus Vth equals an octave,
we can generate any number of steps of fourths and fifths.

I need to get myself or build a metronome to reconstruct
the second part of these experiments, and when done will
complete it.
BTW A stable reference tone is also required (eg. tuning fork)
    to complete the experiment.

The figures for metronome readings represent the beat frequencies,
as beats per minute (i.e. tempo of the beating).
 
I may need to reset the reference frequency on the
spreadsheet to get the bpm values for each stage and each
frequency,as I work through each new note that I wish to examine.
(That's the easy part)
 
 
 
lucy Sunday morning - perfect Hawaiian sunshine with breeze.
I'm outta here for a while to search for a metronome.
 
Does the posting about the Waldorf schools mean that jk,
(my four-year old) is being indoctrinated with JI at the 
local Kinderhale? (Is that the school near Stroud in
the Cotswolds?)
