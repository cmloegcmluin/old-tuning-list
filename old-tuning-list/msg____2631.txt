Subject: New to this list: paradoxical scales, chromatic scales

From: thierry.rochebois@ief-paris-sud.fr (Thierry Rochebois)

Hello,

I am a doctoral student at the Universite Paris Sud in France.
I am involved in analysis and synthesis of musical sounds.

I am also interested in "Paradoxical sounds"(circular scales) and in chromatic
scales (12, 19, 24, 31, 53). I am particularly interested in building a 
"mixed-scale" system, i.e. using the relationships between 12,19 and others
rather than opposing them.



I use the CSound synthesis program, I own an Atari Falcon030 computer and a D5
Roland synthesizer (this synth is not designed for fine tunings, but, thanks to
the Atari, MIDI and pitch bend, it may be possible to achieve interesting
things).

I also run a Web page at:
