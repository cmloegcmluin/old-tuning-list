Subject: The Lion King!!

From: "Andrew L. Kaye" <androsky@fast.net>

Hi Folks.  I don't know how many of you are moms and dads out there, but
those of you who are, are likely to have watched one or more of the
Disney animated musical of the last several years.  Over and over
again.  So you might be all too familiar with, for example, The Lion
King.  I have a tuning-related question concerning the opening song,
"The Circle of Life."  At the climactic cadence of the song, when the
singer reaches into his higher register to sing "IN THE circle......the
circle of lai----ifffee", the singer's tuning on the notes sung to "IN
THE" always seem problematic to me.  We are in a major key, and the
notes are: In (6) the (6) cir-(5) cle (3-2-1-_6-_5), the (_5) cir (4)
cle (3) of (2) lai (2)-aiffe (1).  The "6" note in the scale appears at
this point as the third in a subdominant chord.  It seems to me to be
somewhere between 6 and flat-6.  Has this caught the attention of any
parents-tuning specialist out there?  What note is actually being sung,
and what relationship does it have to the underlying notes?

Thanks,
Andrew "Daddy" Kaye
