Subject: How to Program (fwd)

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I took this off the double reed list as pertinent to the issue of 
programming.  For AFMM concerts, programming is as important for me as 
composing an individual piece.  As other concert forums open up to 
microtonal music there will be less need to have exclusive concerts for 
alternative tuning.  For those that have never heard an AFMM concert, I 
understand it is difficult to imagine how it all fits together, but it 
does.  Listeners modulate dimensionally by both tuning and style.  AFMM 
concerts are experiential and not merely the some of their parts. :)

Subject: How to Program

How to Select a Program is an interesting topic, and one I've never seen 
addressed.  I asked the question on another list and got not one single 
response.  I'll ask a few questions with the goal of continuing the thread.

When selecting a program:

1.  Do you avoid or try to find pieces of similar style, nationality,
or school of composition?

2.  Do you usually include an ensemble piece?

3.  How frequently do you include an unaccompanied work?

4.  Is it important to you to have works representative of each period?

5.  How much consideration do you give to endurance when you select music?

6.  How often do you present works that are new to you compared to works
    that you have played before?

7.  How often do you perform music by live composers?


The above is only the beginning...
