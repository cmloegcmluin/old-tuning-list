Subject: RE: Historical Questions

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I have the impression that most, if not all, recent recordings of Das
Wohltemperierte Klavier on 'historical instruments' are in some variety of
historical tuning. In fact, it is such a commonplace that it won't normally
get mentioned in the liner notes - but is immediately audible. Starting
with Dutch early music specialists in the sixties, most professional
harpsichordists and fortepianists have done their own tuning, and usuallywith a single tuning fork (typically using the A440A as Bb to get something
something close to A415). Learning to set meantone, a Kirnberger or a
Werkmeister by ear isn't terribly hard - while tuning 12tet is really
specialist work unless you're using a digital tuner or a strobe.

At both of my Universities in the States, and here at the Frankfurt
Musikhochschule, the early keyboard faculty and students are themselves
responsible for tuning the instruments. There has been some influence on
the piano world as well - Keith Jarrett, enthused by Lou Harrison's
_Concerto for Piano with Selected Orchestra_ keeps a piano tuned (by
himself) in Kirnberger II, and has released recordings using it.

In the organ world, it has become standard practice to build new or to
restore old tracker organs in historical tunings, in some cases with split
keys. The Oregonian composer Douglas Leedy has made a small career out ofcommissions for new pieces for new organs in historical temperaments. Along
these lines, I guess that Ligeti's _Passacaglia Ungarese_ was the first
work in this century to be composed specifically for a meantone instrument
(Harpsichord).
