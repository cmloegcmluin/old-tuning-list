Subject: Re: Musicality of List Subscribers

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Brian M's suspicion that few subscribers to this list are ... I think his
phraseology was something like "interested in music" ... has gotten me curious.


   So I'd like to try a not-entirely-scientific survey.  Please reply to me
(only;  not to the whole list), and I'll publish the results in several days.
Three questions:
1.  Do you consider yourself more of a theoretician or more of a musician?  
    (I'll let each of you decide how to define those terms, except to say
    I'm refering to the sort of theory that involves such constructs as digits
    to the right of the decimal point, and logarithms.)
2.  Is the total play-time of music - in any tuning - that you've recorded, 
    played live, or scored on paper, greater than 15 minutes?  Again, I'll
    let you use your own judgement for what to count as "music", except to 
    stipulate that it be intended for artistic expression.  Freshman harmony
    exercises, for example, don't count.
3.  Is the total play-time of such music, specifically in unusual tunings, 
    greater than 15 minutes?
