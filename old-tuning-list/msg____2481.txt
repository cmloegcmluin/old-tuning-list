(It's now Webster University, BTW.)  Before that, Gerdine was head of
the music department here at Wash.U.  Here are our library's holdings of
Fokker's musical writings:

        JUST INTONATION AND THE COMBINATION OF HARMO <1949>  (WU)
        NEUE MUSIK MIT 31 I E EINUNDDREISSIG TONEN <1966>  (WU)
        NEW MUSIC WITH 31 NOTES <1975>  (WU)
        SELECTIONS FROM THE HARMONIC LATTICE OF PERF <1968>  (WU)
        UNISON VECTORS AND PERIODICITY BLOCKS IN THE <1968>  (WU)

The third item is an English tranlation of the second, but unfortunately
is not available for InterLibrary Loan.  (It's in our Special Collections
because it's signed by the translator, i.e. Gerdine.)
