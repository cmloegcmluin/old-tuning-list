I would like to know what JOHN CHALMERS thinks about this.

I would also like to ask people,like JOHNNY REINHARD, who include tunings 
as part of their music teachings, if they agree with this. 

I also have a question for ENRIQUE MORENO, McLAREN, and any other on the 
list who deals with non-octave scales. Do you agree with PAUL's 22nd
lecture of his 15-week course on tunings? Do you think it would be right
to spend  one hour out of 30 explaining historical and modern non-octave
scales? Is that how important they are for the future generations?
If you agree explain us how would you split the one hour speech, and if you
don't, how would you do it? Thanks in advance!!!

**********************PART II ***********personal local experience/thoughts****

As far as I know, in UK, all there is available, are musicians trained to
sightread quartertones very accurately. All organized by James Wood (director
of the Microtonal Music Centre in London) and the SPNM that 4 years ago
organized a composers forum where, after an introduction to tunings, we
were introduced to quartertone notation and techniques for diferent 
instruments. Apart from that, there is Charles Lucy who was doing allright
with popular music and who very kindly supports anybody who works with his 
tuning (I personally found him a bit restricted about the idea of using other
tunings that were not acoustically correct according to his theories).


I'm a bit mad about the little access that there is to "microtonality" or 
tunings in the educational system. Is that how we care for future generations.
I just finished a degree on music composition in UK, which is meant to be very
experimental, and avant-garde, and what do I get?
Nothing was mention about any other tuning system different than the 12-tET.
A bit was mention about the freedom of pitches used by Meredith Monk on her
compositions (when apparently she also uses Jewish scales, which were not even
mentioned on the seminar). It seems that some people like Neil H. are doing
very well in getting people interested through playing popular music, and
I would also like to know how people are doing in the educational context.
By the way Paul, do you have any experience teaching tunings? If so, I would
like to hear more about it.
