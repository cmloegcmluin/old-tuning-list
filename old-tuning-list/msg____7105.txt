John Maxwell Hobbs asked
Does anyone know if the AWE64 (or AWE32 for that matter) supports tuning
tables?

The short answer is no.  The EMU8000 processor operating system lacks a MIDI
interpreter capable of handling the demands of tuning tables.  John Loffink
has a list of sound modules and cards that do support retuning at
http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/ .

The General MIDI instrument banks called Sound Fonts can be retuned,
however, but it is a convoluted process.   Dave "Fisher" Rybarczyk, Graham
Breed know more than I do about Sound Font retuning.  Dave has written a
program in Visual Basic that does simple retuning.
