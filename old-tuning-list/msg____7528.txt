Last time we had this discussion, we agreed (I thought) that bowed
strings, winds, and brass instruments had exact integer harmonics for as
long as they sustain a consistent tone. That is a physical fact, true of
any system with a 1-component driver, which oscillates periodically and
therefore (by Fourier's theorem) has exact integer overtones. I don't
think of that as very few acoustic instruments. Plucked or hammered
strings are slightly inharmonic, while drums, bells, and gongs are
totally inharmonic.

A lot of misunderstanding arises on this issue because the modes of
vibration of strings, winds, and brass instruments are not exactly
harmonic series. But that is not the same thing as saying the timbres of
these instruments contain inharmonic partials. The latter statement
would be incorrect.

You'd be better off pointing out that few of the acoustic instruments
with exact harmonic partials (or rather, the players of such
instruments) can produce a pitch which does not waver more than 1 cent.
