This is a reasonable sentiment for a milatary general, but for a keyboard
muscian, it only makes evident the lack of tonal perspective.  
       If you do not recognize  a mean-tone tuning, or a Well temperament,
you are really missing an important perspective on what  12 tone ET actually
sounds like. 
      As far as what is "in tune";  if "in tune" describes that which is
arranged harmoniously,  it is a mathematical fact that equally tempered
keyboards are out of tune.  
      Violinists and other non fixed pitch instruments don't play in equal
temperament very long if left to themselves     .The critical musical ear
naturally seeks the harmonious placement of pitches to form purer intervals
than what is found in 12 tone equal temperament.
