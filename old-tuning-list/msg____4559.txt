Er, I don't think so. Dance club DJ's like to "mix" different tunes together 
and segue from one to another without disturbing the beat. They speed up or 
slow down their turntables by considerably larger fractions than 125/124 to 
do this.

One wouldn't necessarily have to keep the 3-against-2 going for long enough 
to hear the phase drift at each modulation. In fact, one could just switch 
to triplets suddenly, and later establish the basic pulse as an even number 
of these notes, without any drift occuring.
