Subject: Re: Henk Badings

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I would like to share my experience with Henk Badings.  On my first trip 
to The Netherlands Mr. Badings invited me to his home in the Dutch 
"countryside" so that he could hear me play a 31-tone ET scale throughout 
the range of the bassoon.  

He was so happy with the experience that he agreed to compose a new 
quartet for the AFMM - flute, bassoon, cello, and guitar.  A mistake in 
the granting process (outlander rather than inlander) put off the writing 
a full year.  Mr. Badings explained what had happened and that he would 
rectify the situation in the next year - however, he had passed away.

I had been warned about Henk Badings regarding his taking over the 
Conservatory leadership after its previous Jewish director was sacked by 
Nazi order.  As a Jew this is clearly of import.  Badings was guilty of 
moral cowardice in the service of ambition.  He was not, however, a Nazi.

Badings does not have a record that continues in this vein.  He worked 
hard at his craft with often beautiful results.  Unlike Waldheim, Badings 
was quite visible and held accountable by his countrymen.  

My experience was 100% with him 
and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to meet him and his lovely 
wife.  His music is well recorded on LP.  Especially wonderful are his 
many Duos for the Lemkes Violin Duo in 31-ET.  Sadly, Mr. Lemkes lost the 
use of his Bow arm in a traffic accident, silencing Mr. Bading's 
strongest musical voice.  His music is published by Donemus in Amsterdam.
