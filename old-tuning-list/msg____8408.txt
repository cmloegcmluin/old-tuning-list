Gack, I messed up.  To get the desired result the upper interval would
have to beat twice as fast as the lower.  Hmm--I think to get equal
beating you'd have to do something like this: up to the 5/3, down a
chain of three 3/2s-4/3s to 27/32.  The desired mean tone would beat
equally with the 5/3 (a narrow 3/2) and the 27/32 (a narrow 4/3).
