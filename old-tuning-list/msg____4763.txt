Subject: PAULE

From: madole@ella.mills.edu (David Madole)

I (and the Tuning List) are having a hard time making email connections
*out* from mills to PAULE, who must think I am ignoring his pleas for
help.  Attempts to communicate with the MCI mail admin have been abortive
(I CAN get through to them).

Could somebody please pass this message on to PAULE?  Perhaps some
requests from HIS end to MCI mail admin would be useful.  Also, maybe
someone could volunteer to act as a temporary mediator that I could
forward the bounced messages through to him that he could pass to
them.

Thanks,

Dave Madole
