   I think that what John S. and later Paul E. interpreted Neil's comments
to be much more specific than Bruce K., and possibly Neil himself intended
them.  In particular, I think they interpreted them - and it's a meaningful
interpretation - as refering to SPECIFICALLY playing from the harmonic
series itself, as opposed to various tunings built upon the intervalic
resources present in the harmonic series.
