        I wish to thank Mr. Kaye for bringing this point to our attention.
It is gratifying to me that someone not only had the interest to read our
web page but to question one of it's assertions. Your question has
stimulated discussion within our membership and has led us to make a
decision to modify the statement that you questioned.
        What is not apparent with the present wording, is that while some
just intonation composers (including Erv Wilson, Warren Burt, Brian McLaren
and myself) often use unconventional intervals with higher numbers in the
ratios of their frequencies (and as David Canright has shown, even the
intervals of equal temperaments can be measured in terms of frequency
ratios), this is not the practice of most just intonation enthusiasts (The
usual approach being to use the smaller number ratios).
        Also, while many musicians do strive for the most resonant
intonation of whatever intervals they may decide to use, this cannot be
shown to be universal.
        So, thanks to your interest we are (at least for now) abandoning the
assertion that "It is therefore the starting place from which all indigenous
musical traditions began" and will modify our web page accordingly.



Best wishes,

Denny Genovese
