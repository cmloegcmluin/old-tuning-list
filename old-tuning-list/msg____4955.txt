The strings ARE involved in the feedback from an electric guitar. Listen to
electric guitar music - it is an important part of many styles. Controlling
the energy coming back in will either give longer sustain or make a chosen
pitch increace in volume. By pinching the string with the plectrum, second
and above harmonics can be excited.  Using a finger vibrato makes the
fundamental a "moving target" so that only the higher harmonics get re
energised by the feedback.

The strings of an electric guitar will feedback by themselves if placed in
the high levels of sound you get in front of a guitar amp. So will a bass
guitar. A more resonant body will help that feedback because a large
resonant body will feed more energy back into the strings. Semi-acoustic
guitars are often used for this very reason.

The squealing that occurs with some guitars which is nothing to do with the
strings is microphony of the pickups. This is common with the early fender
pickups and other badly constructed units. It is caused by loose windings
in the coil being vibrated by the speaker, the emf induced is fed back to
the amplifier further agitating the coils. It is a high pitch because the
resonance of a little bit of 40swg copper wire is high. Dip your pickups in
hot wax or get better ones!
