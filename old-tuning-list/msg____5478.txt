Subject: Why are we writing?

From: William Richard Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

Thanks, Aline Surman, for your moderate observation
that ET is useful when migrating tonally in a piece.

I'd tune differently for playing Bach and Rameau, and maybe
even keep a roomful of harpsichords, which is easy to do
nowadays, with computers. Though, heaven knows, a real
harpsichord  DOES  feel extremely different.

May I speak to my own problems? I want to know where we're going.

I have spent a long time in school, and am becoming full of
degrees and erudition, but still I don't know where we're going.

My teachers seem to feel that I should just "be myself," but
in practice my self incorporates more problems than simplifications.

It is only a recent phenomenon that any working musician would
dream of leaving "da folks" out of his work, even granted that
in 1750 "da folks" were aristocrats. Aristocrats, now as then,
are notoriously lazy and ignorant. They have lots in common with
everybody else.

So, where are we going?  Why are we working to write music?


Will
