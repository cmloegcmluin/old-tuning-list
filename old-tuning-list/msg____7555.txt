   By the way, just in case anybody was wondering, I'm pretty sure that
that thingie about legislating pi=3 is a joke.  I'll admit it had me going
for a while, but I wasn't sure until I looked up the web page for the
Alabama state legislature and couldn't find the legislator's name, and
found that the Governor's name was incorrect.  So if it's not a joke, it is
at least a very OLD story.

   But I've certainly a lot of scientifically ludicrous statements from
certain politicians before, and the bit about Indiana having attempted and
failed to legislate a rational value for pi apparently is true.

   So I guess there's no need for Charles Lucy to be concerned that
LucyTuned music would, to be legal in Alabama, would have to be played in
equal-temperament!
