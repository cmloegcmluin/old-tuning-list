Charles Curtis
plays Terry Jennings

work of the late Terry Jennings in a special
arrangement for solo cello. Jennings, one of the
earliest minimalist composers, performed and
recorded with La Monte Young in the '50s, '60s
and '70s. Curtis has studied the interpretation of
Jennings' music with Young for ten years and

Young.

Michael J. Schumacher
Monologue
continuous sound environment

Schumacher's installation makes full use of the
magnificent Dream House 30-inch woofers. A
computer produces wave after wave of a big,
bassy sonic ocean, literally vibrating the guts of
the listener. The piece is randomly generated in
"real time" using the six prime numbers that are
the rhythmic basis of all of Schumacher's sound
environments: 13, 17, 23, 29, 37 and 43. By
using complex algorithms, the sound remains in
constant flux, and the many resulting combination
tones create a wild, raging aural seascape.

La Monte Young   Marian Zazeela       
Dream House: Seven Years of Sound and Light

Now in its fifth season, the Dream House has
become known as a sound and light oasis in the
parched desert of serious artistic encounters. "A
magical place," Paul Griffiths, The New Yorker. "A
wild frontier of tonality that has never been
explored, the outer edge of consonance," Kyle
Gann, The Village Voice. "The Dream House is a
unique life experience that you will remember for
years, and one that you will probably return to
time and again. It's a great place to celebrate,
reflect, create, rest, mourn, analyze, energize,
focus, wander, and revitalize." David Farneth,
