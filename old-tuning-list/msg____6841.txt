Thanks, Paul.

That makes sense now, and I'm glad to know that I at least had the
level one concept pretty much "right".  Of course, now I'm wondering,
how did they get produced?  Is there a mathematical method of finding
it, or is it an iterative process of some sort.  Surely, noone sat
down and tried them all by hand... ;-)

And, as long as I'm filling in my knowledge gaps on such things,
here's a question for anybody who would care to answer:

Is there some formula or procedure that one can use to determine the
generating intervals for the MOS scales of various types?  I'm using
an article by John Chalmers in XH 7-n-8 to learn about these scales,
but it only goes up to 20 tones.  I've figured out what the relevant
types are for 21, 22, and 23, but how do I figure out what the
generators are?  [Not that I need that many notes or anything, but
sometimes intellectual persuits are an end in themselves.]


Thanks,

Steve
