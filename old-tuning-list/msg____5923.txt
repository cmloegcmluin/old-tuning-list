What sort of tunings? ET's or just?
What sort of technical restrictions do you run into with various
instruments (and their related performers)?
   For example - with unconventional woodwind fingerings, 1) are there
     problems writing more virtuosic material requiring them (I know
     from playing flute that some alternative fingerings can be pretty
     cumbersome) 2) are there problems acheiving precise intonation
     with them (since not all alt. fingerings are dead on)?
   If your music is just, 1) do performers grasp the concept pretty
     quickly and tune by ear, or do they need to think in terms of
     deviations from 12ET; 2) how high a prime limit do you use, and
what are any difficulties you have with higher primes; 3) how
     beat-free is the result in performance; 4) how much does tradi-
     tional expressivity (vibrato, etc.) intefere with pure tuning,
     or, conversely, how much can it be cautiously applied while
     leaving theoretical niceties audible?
I'm just curious with what your experiences have been performing your
music, positive or negative.
Thanks, Chris
