Amazing how my posts are continually misunderstood. I wrote,

Why does that lead people to argue that Aristoxenus did not advocate equal 
temperament? Of course he did not. The idea of irrational numbers was too 
repugnant to the ancient Greeks. Aristoxenus just described what he heard, 
and a different mathematical mindset may have led to different 
interpretations of his descriptions. As these descriptions were 
self-contradictory, it seems useless to try to figure out what Aristoxenus 
"actually meant" in mathematical terms; however, this didn't prevent ancient 
Greeks or 16th century theorists from doing just that.

No, I meant all 2-limit approximations, i.e., octaves. Many cultures use 
distinctly out-of-tune octaves, yet still recognize an equivalence between 
pitches so separated.

Actually, I prefer to use the "limit" terminology in Partch's original 
sense, for all odd numbers and odd numbers only. However, when discussing 
tuning systems rather than consonance/dissonance issues, the prime usage can 
occasionally be useful.

I don't know how the word "mystical" got attached to Ptolemy, if I made the 
attachment, I apologize, I should have substituted a better word.

Thank you for the info, Jonathan, meantone was my choice as well.
