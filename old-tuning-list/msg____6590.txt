Subject: equal temperaments and pitch classes

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

The discussion on 19 equal has so far ignored the possibility of
19 pitch classes tuned according to the desired harmony.  For
example:

19 notes, maybe.  But why do they have to be equally tempered?

And what is the criterion for a tuning system _being_ mere noise?
That it doesn't reduce to 12 or 19 equal?  I still think melodically
in terms of 12 pitch classes, with diesis or comma inflections.  What
does this prove?

31 equal sounds nothing like either 12 or 19 equal.  Melodies in 12
or 19 pitch classes can, however, be played in 31 equal.

So, the melody C-D-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-Cx-Dbb-D is the same as C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D?
You don't hear the interval Dbb-Cx as a semitone?

Come on, 31 equal steps aren't _that_ complex.  If you agree that it's
smoother, why not use it for its harmony?  It's not that difficult to
convert 19 pitch classes into 19 notes from 31 equal.  Usually, a string
of 19 fifths will do, especially if you're working within the 5-limit.
One day, I'll get a computer to do it automatically.

This is a defect?  Think of the tricks you can perform!

Yes, 22 equal certainly takes you outside of the Western tradition.
It all depends how hung up you are on Western classical music.  Are
you saying that all other music is a mere curiosity?  One of the
characteristic features of this Western tradition is that everything
has to be given a name, and everything without a name is considered
musically unimportant.  I assume be "aurally distinct resources" you
mean intervals that can be given a name, and that people can be trained
to recognise.

What exactly does "close the cycle of fifths" mean?  1/4 comma meantone
has an open cycle of fifths.  If 22 equal has a cycle of fifths, it
closes after 22 steps.  Do you mean, rather, that there is only one
size of perfect fifth?  This seems to raise the diatonic notation to
a principle that I do not consider valid.

A system of 22 pitch classes for 5-limit JI runs into trouble because
the intervals are so unequal.  So, there is an argument here for
equal temperament.  I haven't investigated Paul Erlich's decatonic
modes enough to decide if they can be treated as 10 pitch classes.
I don't like the theory because it clings to the idea of diatonic
harmony -- that all notes used in harmony must belong to the same key.
I'd rather work out a chord sequence, and fit a melody to it.  Or,
define a melodic mode, write a tune in it, and harmonise it
chromatically.

If you're listening to septimal intervals in 19 equal, no wonder you
think they're dissonant!  I outlined a listening experiment on the
list before which confirmed the consonance of the 7-limit.  If you
disagree, can you give specific comments on it?

To state my own opinion, which is the only one I trust, a just 4:6:7
chord is more consonant than a major triad in 12 equal.  Extending
consonance to the 7-limit means just that -- no further.  You can't
disprove an argument by extending it to ridiculous extremes.

An example of a 31 equal mode with septimal harmony is Ab-A-C-C#-Eb-
F-F#-Ab.  The chord C#-F-Ab could be retuned Db-F-Ab, or left as it
is.  If the former, this mode is 7 from 12 pitch classes.  However,
it certainly sounds like a different mode in 12 equal.  In 19 equal,
it is recognisable, but has quite a mournful sound.  It does work
melodically in LucyTuning, but the harmonies are still way out.

To state that 19 equal is the only temperament to do anything is
clearly absurd.  Sharpen one note my a millicent, and nothing
important changes.  Perharps you discounting out of hand all the
meantone temperaments between 19 and 31 equal.  From this
distance, it's very difficult to tell.


Now, to some details:

The biggest problem harmonically with 13 equal is that it's fifths
aren't very good.  Stretching the octave for 19 equal works because
both the 3rd and 5th overtones are approximated flat.  I'd still much
rather use 31 equal, with pure octaves and almost pure major thirds.

So there's no problem with the 54.54 cents of 22 equal, then?  I'll do
the experiment myself when I understand what the terms mean.  I reckon
one step of 41 equal is about the smallest interval that can be used
melodically, but I still tend to avoid it.
