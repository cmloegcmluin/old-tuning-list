Yes, Joe, you are correct about that, but it seems that you may have
been implying otherwise in your post about tritones. That is, I don't
think 64:45 can itself be a "target" but is instead close to several
possible targets. Other notes in the chord can clarify which target that
is, and in the case of dominant seventh chords, only 7:5 can fit with
all the other ratios to define a simple "target chord".
