Subject: A window of opportunity for synth
  manufacturers
---
Csound allows users to generate csound
timbres in real time from MIDI input.  At
present, this capability is limited.  But as
time passes and massively parallel
P7 desktop machines become typical,
 this will change.
This means that synthesizer manufacturers
have a limited window of opportunity.  They
can either get off their rear ends and start
building *real* synthesizers--instead of digital
sample playback boxes full of canned sounds
burned into ROM--or they can go the way of
the dinosaurs.
Within 5-10 years, the average computer
user will be able to generate complex
and interesting csound timbres in real
time via MIDI using a standard desktop
computer.
This brings up the issue of Csound's support
for real-time microtonality.
There isn't any.
Having mentioned this to John Fitch, and
have received no reply, it seems appropriate
to bring it to the attention of the rest of the
forum subscribers.  If you examine the source
code for Csound, you'll discover that Csound
translates MIDI note input into real-time
frequencies by using a 2^N/12  function.
Yes, having thrown off the shackles of
the piano keyboard and all limitations on
scale and tuning, Csound now makes it
possible for us to...play in 12 tones per
octave via MIDI.
Unbelievable.  Disgusting.  Outlandish.
Yet true. 
Csound is locked into 12-TET for MIDI
playback until someone, somewhere
changes the source code.  Naturally, since
this is the prime venue for non-12
computer applications in musical tuning,
not a single person on this forum has
ventured to deal with the problem.
Thus, as always, we head forward into
the past at the speed of light!  Soon,
extraordinary sounds will issue from
our desktop computers...sounds locked 
into 12-TET, thanks to the crippled
artifically limited MIDI-to-Csound
routines frozen into the current
generation of Csound.
There's another issue of concern to
microtonalists:
Has anyone noticed that frequencies
in the HETRO output are specified as
16-bit integers?  With a frequency
range of 20 Khz, this gives a precision
of 20000/32768, not adequate to
describe the fine frequency shifts
that take place within individual
partials during the course of real-
world musical notes.  2/3 of a cent,
for instance, is 4% of a 72-TET scale
step.  While this kind of tuning accuracy
is perfectly acceptable for the overall
musical scale-step, it is surely INadequate
for specifying the fine frequency shifts that
give each changing overtone its "lifelike"
sound during resynthesis, especially when
the resynthesized timbre plays in a microtonal
tuning.
Naturally, no one has bothered to mention this
and naturally, no one has bothered to correct it.
More neglect of microtonality in the very field
(computer music) which ought to be most
congenial to new tunings & new scales.
