Subject: Re: Barbershop Tuning

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Thanks to Ben Denckla for the HTML fomatting command I had 
forgotten. I now have the barbershop tuning forum discussions properly 
formatted on my web page. I have had a little more time to read these, 
and there is some really interesting material (moving tonal centers for 
one) in there. Again, I repeat my offer to forward these forums as email 
to anyone who requests them.
	Has anyone written non-"standard repetoir"ish xenmusic for 
barbershop quartet? I would think there must be some "out there" 
quartets that would jump at the chance to try something really radical.
