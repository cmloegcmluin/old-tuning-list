   Certainly that's more true in a melodic perspective than harmonic.  Diatonic
melodies, even rhythmically simple ones, are very easily recognizable on
shrunken or stretched interval sizes.  Try for example tuning up a synthesizer
to 12 steps per 3:2 and play some familiar melodies.  You'll definitely
recognize them.  They're even recognizable if the "coefficient" is negative as
well as fractional or mixed.  In other words, melodic inversion works!  

   But it's also very easy to see that diatonic harmony is instantly destroyed
by doing this.
