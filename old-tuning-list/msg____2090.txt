MYTH: PITCH IS THE LOGARITHMIC FREQUENCY
HEIGHT OF A MUSICAL TONE, AND ITS
PERCEPTION IS AUTOMATIC AND INNATE.
Fact: There are 3 kinds of pitch: physical,
mel and perceptual pitch.  The 3 differ
significantly. Perceptual pitch is never
identical to the log of the frequency of
the fundamental of the perceived tone,
and mel pitch differs radically from both.
The perception of all 3 kinds of pitch is
strongly influenced by both context and
learned experience.

The perceived pitch of sine tones depends
on their duration and their loudness. "A
150-Hz tone increasing from 45 to 90 dB
drops in pitch to an extent corresponding
to a 12% frequency shift. This is close
to 2 semitones in the diatonic scale. The
sensitivity to this effect varies considerably
between individuals. (...) A funny consequence
of this is that a soft sine tone at 300 Hz
may sound as a pure octave of a loud sine
tone at 168 Hz. The mathematically pure
octave, however, has the frequency of 150
Hz. The tone that sounds as a pure octave
is 12% too high. This means that mathematically
it is a minor seventh! This is a good argument
for avoiding confusion of perceptual and physical
entities." ["The Science of Musical Sounds,"
Sundberg, 1992, pg. 46]
Pierce explains that "By asking naive subjects
to relate frequency changes of sine waves to
 a halving of pitch, psychologists found a mel
scale of pitch (for sine waves). In the mel scale
there is no simple relation between frequency
and pitch; nothing like the octave shows up. (...)
The sounds of orchestral bells are not periodic,
and these sounds do not have all the properties
of periodic musical sounds. One can play tunes
with bells, and the pitches that are assigned
to bells can be explained largely in terms
of the frequencies of prominent almost-
harmonic partials.
"Clucking sounds and shushing sounds (bands
of noise) have  brightness, but no
periodicity. Oddly, *we can play a 
recognizable tune with these sounds,
even though they cannot be heard as 
combining into chords or harmony.* 
Apparently, in the absence of a clear pitch,
brightness can suggest pitch.' ["The Science
of Musical Sound," Pierce, J.R. 1992, 
pg. 37]
"Systematical series of experiments have been
carried out in which listeners have been 
asked to adjust the frequency of a variable
tone so that it sounds "twice as high"
or "half as high" as a reference tone. (...)
The mel scale is constructed such that
a halving of the number of mels corresponds
to a halving of the pitch perceived. As
shown in the figure, a tone with the pitch
of 1,000 mel sounds twice as high as
another tone with the pitch of 500 mel.
Examination of the figure tells us this
corresponds to a frequency shift from
approximately 1,000 to 380 Hz." ["The
Scinece of Musical Sounds," Sundberg,
1992, pg. 47]
The mel scale of pitch measures what
is also sometimes called "ratio pitch."
This is drastically different from the
ordinary scale of perceptual musical
pitch, since the mel scale applies only
to sine tones.  
However, the plot thickens as soon as
we realize that *many musical timbres
can be modelled as sums of sine waves.*
Thus the conceptual basis for 
conventional harmonic-series models
of consonance, as well as for the 
purported acoustic superiority of
small whole-number ratios,
comes into doubt as soon as we
begin to examine the psychoacoustic
evidence in detail.  If perceptual
pitch is always different from 
physical logarithmic pitch, how 
can either equal-tempered or
just intonation tunings offer a
valid model for musical harmony
and musical melody?
To make matters even more complex,
"In certain cases the amplitude 
dependence of the pitch of complex
tones is the opposite of that shown
in Figure 3.4. If the loudness of a 
complex tone of about 100 Hz 
fundamental frequency is increased,
its pitch may rise rather than drop."
["The Science of Musical Sounds,"
Sundberg, 1992, Pg. 46]
"The pitch of pure tones depends not 
only on frequency, but also on other
parameters such as sound pressure
level. (...) Pitch shifts of pure
tones can also occur if additional
sounds that produce partial masking
are presented.  Pitch shifts produced
by a broad-band noise masker are
shown in Fig 5.4, and are given as
a function of both frequency and
critical-band rate of the pure tones,
the level of which is 50 dB. (...)
The results display in Fig 5.5 show pitch
shifts up to 8% at low frequencies
near 300 Hz, and a pitch shift
of only 1% at higher frequencies
between 1 and 4 kHz, due to the octave
ratio of partial-masking tone
and test tone." ["Psychoacoustics: 
Facts and Models," Zwicker
and Fastl, 1993, pp. 105-107]
The pitch of pure tones is also
dependent on their duration. 
Doughty and Garner (1948) found
that pitch is unchanging for tones of 
25 msec and longer, but that
12-msec and 6-msec tones have
a lower pitch. [See Doughty, J. M and
Garner, W.R. "Pitch Characteristics
of short tones. II: Pitch as a function
of tonal duration," J. Exp. Psychol.,
Vol. 38, pp. 478-494, 1948]
Corso summed up the situation when
he concluded that "the pitch of musical
sounds is not directly proportional to
the logarithm of the frequency and is
probably complexly conditioned." [Corso,
J.F., "Scale Position and Performed Musical
Octaves," Journal of Psychology, Vol. 37,
1954]
In short, most of what musicians
"know" about pitch is untrue,
at least as far as pure sine tones
are concerned.   This casts strong
doubt on tuning theories which ascribe
to various pitch relationships "special"
characteristics--in particular, the
data adduced in this post casts strong
doubt on both just and equal-tempered
tuning systems, and would tend instead
to favor non-just non-equal-tempered
tunings.
What about complex tones made
up of many sinusoidal components
and the influence of learning and
context?  What are the implications
for tuning and for music?
That's the topic of the next post.
