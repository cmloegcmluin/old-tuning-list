I have to disagree here.  The word microtonal definitely needs to be on the
front jacket.  The tuning email address will mean nothing to 99.9% of our
customers.  Only after they buy the cd will they realize its significance.

Full color is not that expensive.  Complete CD press runs of 1000 copies
with full color 4 page booklets are in the $1500-$2000 price range.  That
includes film, CD replication, booklet printing, assembly, shrink wrapping
and in some cases graphic design.

Agreed.  This project wouldn't have happened without Neil.  I do not mean to
denigrate Neil's dedication, just to say that future projects could be true
collaborations with someone like Neil taking the lead but not necessarily
working every last detail, just coordinating them.

The logo you refer to was created by the Just Intonation Network and should
only be used with their permission.  But when I mentioned graphics I had
more in mind than just a logo.  Perhaps some consistent graphical framework
with photos/artwork that is different with each volume.
