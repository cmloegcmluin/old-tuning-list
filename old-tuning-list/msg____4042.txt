   I believe that what Brian is refering to is that with non-ETs, you either
need, or will want anyway, more steps per octave, and physical mechanisms of
previous centuries put big limits on how many more steps per octave you can add
beyond 12.  

   However, when you force the circle of fifths to close at 12, there is less
impetus to even wonder about other pitches, because it is a complete system in
itself, and a useful one at that.  Meantone temperaments are not closed at 12
steps per octave.  

   Also, I'm told second-hand that when you tune the strings of a piano such
that the tensions of adjacent keys vary much from one another, they tend to go
out of tune quickly.  That makes ETs easier to realize on piano even if you do
stick with 12-tones/octave.
