Subject: Theremin player wanted

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Oh Tuned Creatures:

Yes, it's true: I am looking for a theremin player! It's actually for a
friend of mine, who has a near lock on a film score that will call for a
small ensemble including a theremin player.

Anyone you can recommend in the LA/San Diego area that can read and play?

Cheers,
Jon
