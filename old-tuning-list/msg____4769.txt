Subject: Ghosttones 2

From: Gary Morrison <MorriSonics@compuserve.com>

Charles Lucy posed a whole big slew of questions about viewing a
vibrating string from various angles and in various lights.  Unfortunately
if he was trying to come to some sort of point with those questions, I'm
afraid I totally missed it, despite having read them twice.  

   Best I can tell his last questions were something of a summary:

   The idea that strings, and most air columns as well, used in common
musical practice have precisely harmonic partials is indeed only an
approximation.  It is also very good approximation.  

   You can see that readily by decomposing and then recreating such a tone
with absolutely perfectly harmonic partials, which I personally have done. 
Without a doubt it's certainly noticeably different, but its effect upon
harmony is far less than, for example, chorus effect.  The relative
amplitudes of the partials are almost certainly more significant to the
perceived character of harmonies than such minuscule pitch deviations.  

   That however is not even close to true for characteristically
nonharmonic instruments like xylophones, bells, timpani, and is only
marginally true for the piano.  

   One of these days I'll have my internet/web act together and post some
strictly harmonic tones with their "original" versions.
