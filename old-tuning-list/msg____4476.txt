Adam,
	    I don't believe Mayumi Reinhard intended her scale as a "13-plane" 
scale with some arbitrary omissions and additions; I think it has a 
different derivation. Do the Reinhards care to comment?

	    As for CPS scales, I have a very good understanding of these after 
discussions with John Chalmers, which led me to some discoveries on 
multidimensional tilings after relating CPS to Euler genera. How do you see 
the "13-plane" scale as related to the CPS concept? I don't see it, but that 
doesn't mean it isn't there.

	    P.S. Don't consult Brian's posts for info on CPS, although these were 
far less misleading than his recent post on group theory.
