If I saw that, I would think 1059 cents, not 969.

I did not claim that I could do this! I certainly couldn't do it very 
accurately. I did mention that the accuracy of logarthmic pitch-distance 
perception was far more crude than the accuracy that can be acheived by 
tuning to eliminate beats. I just claimed if one had systematically learned 
72-tet, one could do it very easily. I've given myself comprehensive 
ear-training in 22-tet and 31-tet, not 72-tet. I would further claim that 
one could hear the difference in the melodic intervals without a tuning 
machine. It is quite possible to distinguish, by ear, major scales which 
divide the major third in half, from those that divide it into unequal parts 
like 5:4 (logarithmically), without listening to any harmonies.

>Can you sing easily a scale of 5ET?  7ET?
>Yes, IF you learn it by rote.

The musicians of Thailand, without the benefit of oscilloscopes, etc., 
achieve 7et very nearly. This was probably achieved through a 
trial-and-error method, and subsequently learned by rote. But the fact that 
it was acheived in the first place is evidence of logarithmic hearing. One 
can distinguish 5ET from other pentatonic scales, not necessarily in a 
musical context, but by listening to the melodic intervals one by one and 
noting any differences.

>Mathematical machinations to the contrary, cents deviations from a 12ET
>grid is for all musicians, not only AFMMers.

Dismissing arguments based on practicality, feasibility, and acoustics as 
"mathematical machinations" does not contribute to intelligent dialogue. 
Apparantly members of Franz Richter Herf's institute and those who have 
performed Ezra Sims' music do not fall under the heading of "all musicians."
