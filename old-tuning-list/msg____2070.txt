Are any of the piano's strings single strings?  I certainly don't claim to be
an expert on piano mechanisms, but whenever I've looked into a grand piano
anyway, I could swear that even the low A was a course of two strings.  

   Anyway, assuming that your memory is better than mine, then I'll give a very
nonspecific answer that the partials on real instruments are rarely precisely
harmonic.  Also you could well be hearing some comparatively quiet tones in
other vibrational modes, possibly tortional.
