>A tone might be the 8/7
of a 5/4 chord and the 5/4 of an 8/7 chord, but it's still 10/7 of the
tonic either way.  If these are puns, then one is punning every time one
changes chords.  But this essentially drains the meaning from the term.

I would only consider something a pun (in more traditional terminology,
an enharmonic substitution) if a tone were reinterpreted to a different
part of the lattice, e.g. suddenly treating 15/8 as 48/25.<

Although the tone in my example may be heard as 10/7 of some pitch, it is
not neccessarily heard as 10/7 above a tonic. A tonic is established from
within a collection of pitches, and a pun is a function not of a single
intervallic relationship but of a set of relationships. If I establish a
tone as the 5/4 above a tonic and then suddenly present it as the 8/7 of a
tone _not_ present in the initial collection, I am, in effect, moving our
center of reference to a different part of the lattice. (If you still
disagree, then please define how far apart on a given lattice two tones
would have to be to qualify...). 

I cannot identify intonational puns with ''enharmonic substitutions''
alone. Above and beyond my discomfort with the term ''enharmonic'' when
used in this context (I prefer to save ''enharmonic'' for the classical
tetrachord with the narrowest pycnon), ''enharmonic substitutions'' arise
in temperaments where series of intervals coincide and a single pitch can
be notated in more than one way. Intonational puns (and no one has yet
challenged my priority for the term) can cover a broader range of
phenomena, including the deliberate use of close but wrong pitches, and
pivot tones. Earlier on the list I distinguished portmonteau puns which are
heard simultaneously in more than one sense and those that are heard
differently over time.
