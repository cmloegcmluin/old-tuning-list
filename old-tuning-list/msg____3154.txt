As for whether more tones have subharmonics than don't...  Well, I suppose
that may depend on whether you're counting notes available on each unique
instrument type, or notes present in existing repertoire.  Or maybe there isn't
really all THAT much disparity between the two.  

   I based my statement that more musical tones in the orchestra have
subharmonics than don't, upon the what I saw in my (roughly 300-tone) test suite
for my program.  It contained typically about 20 notes across the range of each
instrument in the usual orchestra, and other instruments.  So the orchestral
strings appeared as 4 of 15 or so instruments in the test suite.  Counting them
that way, certainly more have subharmonics than don't, from what I saw.

   But I suppose one could argue something along the lines that:
1.  There is more repertoire for strings than for winds.  
2.  There are more stringed instruments - even orchestral ones - out there 
    than just violins, violas, 'celli, and basses.
3.  Although the strings represent only four instrument types of instruments,
    the orchestra nevertheless contains more chairs for more strings than for 
    winds.  
Arguing from those perspectives, I suppose the question becomes harder to
quantify.
