Neat!

William, can you please explain how you determined what frequencies to
play at what time.  I imagine that the crystal output (slowed down) is a
bit like sitting on the keyboard and staying there so you need a way to
seperate the notes.

If any of you composer types want data on this sort of thing then I have
the CRC handbook which has 3600 pages of physical and chemical
constants.  It includes the spectra of all elements and heaps of other
similar stuff.  I also have a scanner that can do OCR (although it is
behaving weirdly at present) which allows lots of numbers to be put in
with little effort and good accuracy.

*** All my posts to the list seem to suffer from numbers being inserted
after certain characters.  For example an equal sign "=" gets the
treatment as did some recent capital f's "F".  This does not appear to
happen to other people's posts and it doesn't happen to me on any other
list or in usenet or email.  Does anyone have a clue about this?  ***
