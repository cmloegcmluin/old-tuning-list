I got so caught up in describing and plugging the story that I forgot
my original point: namely, that his music does _not_ become ugly.  It
remains extraordinarily beautiful.  The state finds it necessary to stop
his output because (in their eyes) it is, by virtue of the fact that he
has been "polluted" by hearing Bach, _no longer entirely original_.  He
has heard another's musical ideas, and cannot help but be influenced by
them.
