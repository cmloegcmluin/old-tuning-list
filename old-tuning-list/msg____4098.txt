Subject: Shadowy Cabal Foiled! (film at 11)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

The estimable Dr. Strange spake unto the cybermasses, saying:

How can this *be?* Isn't this the hotbed of that diabolical Ferneyhough
person (whose setting of "Stabat sutem iuxta crucem" graces the recent
Hilliard Ensemble "New Music for Voices" double-CD on ECM in a most
non-complex manner, by the way. Gracious, could be be a more complex
composer than is easily described by the phrase "New Complexity?" Naah....)?
The solar batteries on the mind-scrambler satellites commonly used to
brainwash America's academic youth into a lifetime of Babbitry must be
failing.

Wait - come to think of it, the Freshman theory courses *here* are doing
a similar approach. And they're also yanking their students into the kind
of harmonic territory favored by Duke and Billy more often than George
Perle. And, come to think of it, the computer music classes are *waaay*
outside of that supposedly standard atonal serialist agenda from the git-go.
Can someone point out to me exactly *where* this Cabal of exclusionists
rules supreme? Doesn't look like that's the case in very many academic
establishments *I'm* near. In fact, that lack of a single, totalizing discourse
is making some of the students positively *crazy,* if anything. I view that
as an instructive dilemma, of course.

Bravo, Brian.

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
