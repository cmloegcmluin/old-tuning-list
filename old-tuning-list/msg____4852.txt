I see no difference here. I could say, "19 consistenly represents 9-limit
JI 
and 34 consistenly represents 5-limit JI," but I didn't want to start the 
odd vs. prime debate on the definition of "limit" again.

   I'm not sure about 19 or 34 right off the top of my head, but there is a
difference:

   Approximating the harmonic series itself forces them to be represented
relative to the fundamental of that series.  Two harmonic approximations in
some equal-temperament could, for example, be way flat of the harmonics
they are closest to, but if they are nearly equally flat, then that tuning
will have a pretty good approximation to that frequency ratio, but not of
either of those harmonics.
