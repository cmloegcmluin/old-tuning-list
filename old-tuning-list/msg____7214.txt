Subject: Homemade musical instruments

From: "Ed & Alita Morrison" <essaim@texas.net>

For those of you who wondered why I didn't buy a steel guitar ready made,
Gary Morrison identified the reason why I made the "steel guitar" rather
than buy one made in a factory.  I like to make things.  I make lots of
things, not only musical instruments.  I own only a few tools, but the work
is fun and imaginative.  These musical non 12 TET scales are
"unconventional" and so are my instruments.  I have some ceramic musical
instruments also.  Some work better than others and are not intended to be
played together with other instruments.  I made them as part of ceramics
classwork at a local university.  Have some fun, don't be too serious about
your music.  ALITA MORRISON
