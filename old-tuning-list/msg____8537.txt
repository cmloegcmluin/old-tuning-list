While the thirds accordian proportionately to the fifth (however large is
one third, the other is condensed), the neutral third is always dead
center, dividing the fifth into 2 identical parts.  Just as the tritone
bisects the octave, the neutral third bisects the perfect fifth.

The neutral thirds of all the meantones, 12-TET, 31-TET, quartertones,
Egyptian music, and others are roughly all in the same place because the
fifth is so etched in its shape.  The difference of a few cents in either
direction from 351 cents (at perfect fifth of 702 cents) is negligible for
musical purposes.

Consider it anecdotal in that I've come to recognize the place of the
neutral third as a distinct relationship in the order of musical sounds,
common to more than its share of tunings.
