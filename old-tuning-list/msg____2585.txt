In reference to Kami's questions, I pronounce 7/4 as "seven four,"
and call the interval either a 7/4 or a harmonic seventh, depending
upon context. Similarly, 1/1 is 'one one," 3/2, "three two," and a
perfect fifth, etc. What to name 1/1 is more of a problem as "tonic," "fundamental," or "root" is not correct in all contexts.
 
A few French authors still use Savarts, either 301 or 300 of them to the 
octave.
 
I think the least perceptible musical interval is closer to 2 cents,
approximately 866/865, though many people's discrimination stops at 2 
or 3 times this.
 
Why would asthmatic children hear higher pitches than normal ones, if 
that is the implication of Manuel's post?  As for the 200,000 hz Russian 
experiment, I suspect the subjects were "hearing" by some mechanism other
than normal audition, perhaps by direct neural stimulation, or because 
of subharmonics generated in the skull, etc.
 
I've known adult women who can hear ultrasonic security systems, but
I don't know the frequency used. I would guess about 25Khz.
