I know this whole business can be very confusing, but let me try to
explain this step by step.

First of all, as the title of this message indicated, I am talking about
odd-limit theory, as in Partch's original definition. The limit is
defined as the highest number needed in the representation of the
interval or chord after all factors of two are discarded (octave
equivalence is the justification for discarding them). This also agrees
with Ralph D. Hill's observation that every new odd number adds a new
quality, as well as a higher degree of tension, to a chord. I used to
believe (though I'm not sure in light of my recent obsevation here) that
a given style of music established a certain odd limit as the norm;
higher-limit chords will sound dissonant and need to resolve, while
lower-limit chords will sound incomplete. This is certainly applicable
to Common Practice and the 5-limit; 3-limit pentatonic examples are
easily constructed, and I believe I've taken a first step toward
realizing the 7-limit case (see my upcoming Xenharmonikon paper).

Now let us state what we mean by "representation." For an interval, this
is just a lowest terms ratio p/q; we can define this to be the frequency
ratio, in which case the period (or wavelength, string length, . . . )
ratio in lowest terms is just q/p. Either reprentation implies the same
odd limit for the interval.

Following Partch, we will define integer multiples from 1 to n of a
frequency to be an "n-otonality," and integer multiples from 1 to n of a
period (or wavelength, string length, . . .) to be an "n-utonality." So
we can define the otonality-limit as the lowest n for which a chord
(with all factors of 2 removed) is a subset of an n-otonality, and
similarly for the utonality-limit.

For a chord of 2 notes, the limit of the 1 interval in the chord is the
same as the utonality-limit and the otonality-limit of the chord. For
more than two notes, the otonal or utonal representations may differ in
complexity, in which case the simpler one is often chosen and the chord
is deemed as appropriate. For example, 10:12:15 is a "5-limit utonality"
and 4:5:6:7 is a "7-limit otonality." As Paul Hahn has pointed out, the
3-limit, 5-limit, and 7-limit are particularly easy cases to deal with,
since if all intervals of a chord belong to one of these limits, the
chord itself will belong to that limit either as an otonality or as a
utonality.

However, the 6th chord 12:15:18:20 has an otonality-limit of 15, a
utonality-limit of 15, but no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Kami
Rousseau's 6th chord 14:18:21:24 has an otonality-limit of 21, a
utonality-limit of 21, but again no interval is beyond the 9-limit. Paul
Hahn's example 18:22:24:33 has an otonality-limit of 33, a
utonality-limit of 33, but no interval is beyond the 11-limit.

It appears then that there is a new class of "saturated" chord beyond
the otonal and utonal chords that Partch envisioned. By saturated I mean
that no new notes can be added without increasing the odd-interval-limit
of the chord. I think this finding merits investigation as a natural
extension of Partch's work.
