Subject: Re: Dowland's Preferred

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

John Dowland's son Robert indicated the frettings of his father's lute
temperament.  I had the opportunity to examine this on microfilm at the
Columbia University music library.  (And it's in English!)

Essentially it is a set of instructions for placing the frets.  I
indicated each and every pitch on each string on the cover of the AFMM
publication PITCH I:1.  

Since it is a tablature notation for Dowland's music.  I don't know if I
can give a complete linear ordering of pitches.  Some notes have 2
different pitches available.  Tablature erases any confusion about which
one to play.  

When Wim Hoogewerf saw PITCH in Paris we started working toward the day
when he would play Dowland in this temperament.  And to grand success,
based on all experiences to date.

For the lowest string, the pitches are (beginning at the first fret)
108, 204, 285, 388, 498, 597, 702, 810, 906, 986

For 2nd lowest string
606, 702, 783, 886, 996, 

You get the idea...:)
