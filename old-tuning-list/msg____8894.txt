I _don't_ think this experiment is very different
from most concerning at least psychoacoustics --
and that was my point.

As we've debated in this forum very recently,
it is becoming increasingly clear that a person's
perception of consonance is extremely subjective,
and has as much to do with musical context,
social conditioning, the structure of an individual's
ear, and the particular set of preconditions embedded
in that person's experience (and possibly many
other factors), as it does with psychoacoustics.

I don't have a problem with the results these
researchers got, from their experiments, regarding
psychoacoustics.  I _do_ have a problem with the
extrapolations they made, from their results, to any
significant comment about _music_.
