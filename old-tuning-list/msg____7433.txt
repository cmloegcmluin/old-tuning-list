   Just generally speaking, Ensoniq probably has the best microtonal
provisions.  As far as the most musical capability is concerned, it seems
like the K2500 could be your best bet, but its microtonal capabilities
aren't as flexible or intuitive as Ensoniq's.

   I have lots of Ensoniq gear, but my K2500 information is based upon a
friend trying to use his microtonally.  He describes it as "designed by
Martians", but very powerful.
