Betreff:Kopie von: Re: pop in microtones

I agree largely with Jon Szanto. The bulk of pop music is, and will
continue to be built upon, a bedrock of the prevailing temperament. Lest I
be misread as eurocentric, this goes as well for Turkish Arabesk, Indian
film music, or Javanese Campur Sari, where the local temperament does
indeed vary from 12tet by microtonal intervals, but it would be an imperial
gesture to claim that they are therefore microtonal in themselves. In all
of these traditions, there are ornamental, and expressive deviations from
the temperament (as well as outright mistakes in intonation!) but the
structural referent is always that tempered set. And to claim that the
variation in tuning from one gamelan or piano to another constitutes
''microtonal music'' rather than tolerance within a norm, can only be true
when two such varied instruments are used together.  I can well imagine
that the decreasing costs of digital number crunching will one day allow us
to retune a given recording as we like, but I suppose that it will be
introduced as a kind of enhancement in sound quality - akin to the noise
reduction of my youth.

Microtone is a useful word - for an interval smaller than a semitone. Let's
not rob this useful word of its utility by claiming it to mean so much that
it ends up meaning so little!
