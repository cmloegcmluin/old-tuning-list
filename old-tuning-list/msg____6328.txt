From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

I always enjoy the discussions about ratios and eq temps. It is true
that being "in tune" is a mathematical phenomenon of frequencies matching
up perfectly...I agree that when we say eq temps approximate a pure
ratio, it doesn't correlate in a way because as soon as you are off of
the ratio, the new note is NOT the ratio, so it IS something else. Just
exactly what it means to have music that vibrates impurely is probably a
pretty poorly studied area, but I know that some folks think it can cause
great harm in various ways. I use eq tunings because I love chord
changes...I am under no illusions about what I do, and why. I also know
that music possesses a "magic," a quality that transcends logic and
intellect. Whether or not impure tunings twist or distort this magic, or
whether it works regardless of tuning systems, is an area that I'd like
to see more discussion on. Sound is a foundation of the fabric of the
Universe, and has a powerful effect... I feel there's a lot of mysterious
things about music, and tuning and frequencies are a very important part
of those mysteries. The effect that music has on people (and the overall
environment), separate from the issue of tunings, is also a quite valid
area for study...but, since it is not quite as "scientific" as
frequencies, it's a bit harder to get a handle on in any definitive
way...Hstick
