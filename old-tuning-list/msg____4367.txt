Subject: equal temperaments on the fly in kyma

From: "Marcus Hobbs" <marcus@fa.disney.com>

here's another example of how a xenharmonisist might use
the kyma:
i wrote a sound that lets you change the equal
temperament on the fly.  you use controller data to designate
the temperament from 2-128 TET.  you could do temperaments
greater than 128, but the sound would have to be extended
to handle mapping midi note numbers to a range greater
than 128. a second controller is used to specify an octave
deviation (from -6 to +6 octaves, but again, you could specify
it anyway you want).  the results are clipped to be
on range.  you can plug any waveform/timbre into this sound.

i'd be happy to chat with anyone interested in how i'm using
the system to do alternate tunings.  you should also give
carla scaletti or kurt hebel a call...they designed and support
the kyma.
