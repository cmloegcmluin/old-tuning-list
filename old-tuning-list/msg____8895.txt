First, welcome to the List.

I've decided it would be more fruitful to send this
to the List than to you personally.  Perhaps others
have comments.

The "subharmonic scale" can be characterized as a
utonal progression, in Partch's terms.  It is the
exact inverse of the "harmonic series" of overtones
above a fundamental.  In the case of subharmonics,
the "fundamental" is the highest note in the series,
with the subharmonics in reciprocal integer ratios
below it.

The proportions as we used in our improv were as follows,
with pitch progressing from the top down, and with
the equivalent "bottom-up" standard terms given for
the notes which form the "minor triad":

1/3  "fundamental"
1/4  "5th"
1/5  "minor 3rd"
1/6  "root"
1/7  
1/8  "5th"
1/9
1/10  "minor 3rd"
1/11
1/12  "root"
1/13
1/14
1/15
1/16  "5th"
1/17
1/18
1/19
1/20  "minor 3rd"
1/21
1/22
1/23
1/24  "root"
1/25
1/26

Note that we normally skip the 1/1 and 1/2 as they
just produce higher octaves of the top 1/3.  Intervals
between notes become progressively smaller as you
go down the scale.

The top note, 1/3, was around 3200 Hz.  Notes below
1/16 are progressively smaller "semitones" -- the
keyboard tuning went much further than this, but
notes near the bottom were quite low in pitch and
sounded more like rumbles than clear subharmonics.
