In traditional harmony, the dominant seventh is a dissonance and must be 
tuned as a dissonance. Otherwise, it doesn't want to resolve. In jazz in the 
mixolydian mode, the dominant seventh chord is the tonic chord, and tuning 
it more purely can only add to its tonicity. It can, however, make the chord 
sound out of tune with respect to the scale. That's why I'm working with 
22-tet, where many tetrads resembling the mixolydian seventh and the dorian 
sixth come out of a coherent scale and gain "melodic justification" as well 
as more harmonic purity than the 12-tet or other diatonic versions.
