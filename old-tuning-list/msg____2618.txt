Subject: Re: Proteus Tuning

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Of course I have used the Proteus tuning table, but right now I'm not 
limiting myself to a fixed scale, and wanted to use pitch bend to 
hear the pitches in counterpoint.

About these little glissandi between notes when pitch bend is used: does 
the microtonal MIDI spec say anything about this?

On another matter, I want to say that the Toby Twining group was in 
Raleigh, North Carolina last night, and they put on an excellent and 
entertaining concert.  The show included seven pieces from Toby, an 
audience-participatory mime improvisation, and a premiere of Ben 
Johnston's imprvisatory "Mantram and Ragas".
