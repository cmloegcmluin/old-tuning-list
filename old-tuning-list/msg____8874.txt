Subject: Don Ellis

From: monz@juno.com

Just some background -- the reason why John
Starrett mentioned Don Ellis in the first place
is because Ellis is in my bio: my hearing of his
"Bulgarian Bulge" way back in high school got me
very interested in Bulgarian music, which in turn
got me thinking rhythmically the same way as
Bulgarian musicians (asymmetrical meters grouped
in 2s and 3s played very fast).

I had quite forgotten that he played quarter-tones.
