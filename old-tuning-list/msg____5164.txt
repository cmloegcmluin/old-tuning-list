Hey y'all-

"This isn't right. This isn't even wrong." 
	Wolfgang Pauli, on a paper submitted by a physicist colleague:

	What an appropriate quote. There seem to be two main camps here, those 
who believe in action at a distance and those who don't. Depending on our 
definition of "action", rational scientific philosophies may be built 
incorporating either view. The case for particle exchange as the mediator 
of all physical interaction has been made already, I believe. 
	
	While I do not believe gravitons from Mars affect us in any 
profound "physical" way, we are all nevertheless bound up inextricably in 
the geometry and dynamics of the universe. 

WARNING!! What follows is only an analogy!

ANALOGY:
 WHILE NOT CONVINCED DO

  An individual point in a phase plane can be considered as a separate 
  point, but as part of a flow (set of solution curves) of a differential 
  equation this point is profoundly "influenced" by the dynamics of the 
  flow. A small perturbation of the underlying dynamics could place our 
  intrepid point on either side of the unstable manifold of a saddle, and 
  its evolution under the flow would be greatly changed. Furthermore our 
  point, let's call him Pointy (what character development!) is 
  delicately related to all the other points in his particular solution 
  curve, as a small perturbation to the dynamics will place him in a 
  completely different curve. If there is more than one attractor in the 
  system, there might be fractal basin boundaries, or even riddled 
  basins, so that the smallest change in Pointy's position or the system 
  dynamics could mean completely different outcomes. 

END ANALOGY

	Is this action at a distance? Not in the standard physical sense, 
but the percieved connection between objects and events can take many 
forms. Astrology used to be our best stab at physical cosmology, and 
although it is no longer considered science, adherents are not 
necessarily drooling Ricky Lake junkie trailer trash. It is human 
nature to experience mystical feelings, and these feelings will find 
expression, whether couched in the terminology of Buddhism, raga or 
superstring theory. There is an underlying structure in our common 
experience that finds eloquent expression in the works of great creative 
artists, like Bach, Einstein and Eckhart, and I think we are all richer 
for the variety of sensual and intellectual experience. 

	When someone claims that "forces" influence us in a 
certain way, these effects can be measured with our best equipment or 
the claim interpreted in light of our best and latest paradigm, but we 
must be careful to define our terms and assumptions precisely so that 
we know we are all speaking the same language. Physicists and 
mathematicians tend to use very precise terminology, and when some  
someone uses the term "chaos" in conversation with me, I must be careful 
not to assume they are using it in the same sense that I would, lest we 
miscommunicate. I may not believe that the planets influence us, but if 
you do and you write a music of the spheres, I sure would give it a 
listen.
