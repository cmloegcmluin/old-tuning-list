This is  _exactly_  the point I made several times.
I never claimed I or anyone else could hear prime
"ness" in a specific interval -- just that it comes out
when listening to real music.  The more, and more
different kinds of, intervals you are hearing, the
easier it is to pinpoint the effect/ affect of the
prime factors.
