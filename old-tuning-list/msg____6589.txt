From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

As always, I continually realize what a hoot this forum is...I am
constantly learning and challenging my own beliefs...there's some mighty
smart and perceptive folks here, so I am grateful. As far as what Mr.
Gibson said about musicians writing for the masses, and not for the
exceptionally acute listeners...Gregg, when I write, I try and follow my
inner voice, the gift I have been given, whatever that may be. I am not
trying to write for anyone, although after a piece is conceived, I may
then try and decide if it is appropriate for one group or another. There
are some of my pieces that I would not play in a blues bar, for instance,
because they are inappropriate for that group of folks, at that time.
When I write using 34 tone equal temperament, I am aware that the
"masses' may not relate to it so well, but is that because of the
cultural training we all receive, or what? I feel that if a piece is good
and real, than the tuning is not the main issue...it's the end result. I
see no reason why the "masses," whoever they are, cannot like music in
any tuning, as long as the piece itself is valid. Which gets into some
interesting areas...are we writing music to try and please the largest
number of people possible (and from which culture, by the way...a large
group of Turkish folks may well relate totally differently to a
particular piece than a bunch of people from Alabama, I think), or are we
writing music that we feel needs to be written because we hear it that
way? Which musicians did you mean, anyway, when you said that "they"
write for the masses?
    Also, again on the issue of hearing teensy intervals, and are they
musically valid... I am sure that training is the issue here, not can we
hear small intervals. Of course we can...the old saw about people using
only 10% of their brains is very applicable in this case. I am confident
that, if people were brought up with the concept of intervals smaller
than 12 equal, we would find that most people could hear intervals
smaller than 12, 19, or whatever. Gregg, I would suggest that you look
into the music of Joe Manieri, for one...he uses 72 equal, and even
teaches this system, and claims that folks have little trouble with it,
once they are exposed to it. I also recommend listening to Johnny
Reinhard's string quartet, "Cosmic Rays, " which has comma intervals
throughout...I can hear them, and I am sure that anyone could, if given
the proper training and exposure...I am presently writing a 34 tone piece
that uses the comma interval (one 34 tone step, in this case) as the
primary interval of the piece, and have played it for several
folks...everyone can hear it, and I personally think it is essential to
the piece, and has a real haunting sort of effect. Why you believe what
you do is a mystery to me at this point; it is far removed from many of
the "microtonalists" I have gotten to know so far, but perhaps future
discussions will make your position clearer...Hstick  PS...also, to
dismiss tunings because they are "useless" reminds me of Duke Ellington's
comments about music in general...there's only two kinds of music, good
or bad. A tuning is useful if you write something good in it...HHH
