Just out of curiosity, why couldn't the piano be tuned? Was the tuner or
the piano's owners unwilling? Or were there physical reasons why it could
not be done?

This sounds like someone who hasn't had a lot of experience with JI and who
has a very narrow view of what tonal music is, how motion can be defined,
and how interest in music can be created. It sounds like he claims that one
can't have a dissonance in JI, which is not true, at least to my own
definition of dissonance. By the same token, one could say that it is
impossible to have a consonance in 12TET (which does have some truth to it,
though your theorist might disagree). To me, tonal music does not
necessarily imply harmonic progression towards a goal - that's just what
European common-practice music was. Nor does a composer have to employ
harmonic progression towards a goal to create interest in a tonal
composition. There are often theorists who say that this or that kind of
music "can't work," when I think they are finding justifications for their
own personal preferences rather than arriving at universal rules

I don't think it's suited for atonal music. I think it reinforces tonality
by its very nature, though I am using the term tonality in much more
general sense than the "tonal music" of the common-practice period. Lou
Harrison says that Schoenberg's great genius was in the realization that
12TET leads to atonality by its very nature.

>Can a composer write JI music that provides tonal motion rather than just
>common-tone modulation?  Can this be done with a mere 12 notes or less?

I don't really understand how "tonal motion" and "common-tone modulation"
are considered opposite directions, but I certainly think that JI can
support tonal motion. One need only to listen to much of the JI written to
hear that. Modulation, of course, is very limited in JI, but only if you
want all of your keys to sound the same. If you take the changed quality of
the different keys as a new resource, you can turn this to your advantage.
Of course the more tones per octave the more possibilities. (I chuckle a
bit at the "mere 12 notes" as I have been writing a lot of pentatonic music
lately -- now that's a difficult compositional exercise!)

>If the answer to these is "no", for what style is JI best suited?

If you listen to some of the compositions being done today, as demonstrated
on the Just Intonation Network's samplers, you will hear an enormous
variety of styles, though all within what I would call a tonal framework.
