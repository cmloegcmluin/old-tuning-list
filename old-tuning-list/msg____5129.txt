Expensive  --  well, only relatively.  It's a bargain for the computing
power it delivers!

I'm 42, a bassist (with past rock & roll loud performing), but still in
reasonably good shape, etc., and my hearing discrimination also fades out
arount 16 kHz.  Either I'm holding on OK or Marcus is aged before his time!

At 14 kHz and above, the frequencies really become "high sparkle" to me,
and so I use them in my composing rather freely in that way.  I carefully
control lower frequencies (using Kyma) for ultra-precise melodic/harmonic
relationships, but up high I let them float around freely for color and
texture.  I can't hear them with more specification, so I assume that no
one else can either.
