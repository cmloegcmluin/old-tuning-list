Subject: Miscellanea

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Adam: re "untempered criticism." I added the words, but I wasn't really
trying to write an automatic ranter.... But, it shouldn't be hard,
alas.

Re CET, TET, MET, etc: Bruce Gilson and a few other theorists 
use millioctaves specifically to avoid the built-in pro-12 bias of 
cents. Yasser used centitones (600 to the octave); some French
theorists Savarts (300/octave). The late composer Paul Beaver favored
"harmos," the cycle of 1728 (12 cubed in base-12) to the octave.

For special purposes, I think many these log measures might have their uses.
I've invented a few, not entirely seriously, though, and put them in
XH 15.

BTW, I recently received a copy of "The Micro-Tome," the newsletter of
the Boston Microtonal Society. This issue (November 1996) carries an
interview with Ezra Sims and an article about Ives's Universe Symphony.
For more information, write Boston Microtonal Society, 27 Valentine
Street, Boston, MA 02139.
