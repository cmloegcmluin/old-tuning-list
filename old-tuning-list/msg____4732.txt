From: TONY SALINAS <salinas@lgu.ac.uk>

I'm planning to go to the festival May'97 of microtonal music
with a short budget, maybe Johnny Reinhard has a job for me
collecting tickets or doing administration???? ... or maybe
somebody from New York in this forum is interested to do
do exchange. What I can offer is accomodation here in London
for a couple of weeks. Maybe somebody is interested on doing
research in the British Library! ...There's also a Microtonal
Music Festival in X-mas organized by James Wood...any time
would be fine for me.

I would also be interested to met the microtonalists of the 
area!!!

Looking forward to hear from you

Tony Salinas
