Subject: Diary of a CD-R Novice

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
	This begins a series of short posts on the trials and 
tribulations of a physicist-musician-inventor learning to use CD 
recordable technology. CD-R allows you to record your own CDs on a 
desktop unit onto $6 discs. The recorders are currently available for 
approximately $700 (in a couple of months all of the big names--Sony, 
Phillips,... will be available for under $700). 
	First let me clear up a couple of mistakes from my last post (I'm 
a novice, so I get to make a few). I stated that my expert source (a CD 
professional) said to avoid JVC units. He did not say that they were no 
good, simply that in his opinion Sony seemed sturdier. Further, I stated 
that CD-R had a conservative lifespan of 10 years, and that standard CDs 
outlasted this. My other expert source strenuously 
disagrees, stating that CD-R will outlast standard CD media, as the 
aluminum is subject to oxidation from oxygen dissolved in the 
polycarbonate, while the gold reflective surfaces of CD-R discs is not. 
Further, she states, unless the CD-R disc is exposed to extremely bright 
light (much brighter than sunlight) for long periods, say days or weeks, 
the information will not likely degrade.
	Last night I installed the SCSI board and CDR unit in my machine, 
a Gateway 2000 75MHz Pentium, and fired it up. The system could not 
locate the CD-R drive, and the software supplied with the SCSI board had 
a faulty #2 disk, so I couldn't run the diagnostic. Well, that's what you 
get for using a DOS system. I will try to download some new software from 
the net and get this thing up and running so I will have something a 
little more heartening to relate next post.
	On a more upbeat note, Denver's Microstock festival is being 
organized for the 19th of October, and we are presenting a day of 
lectures and demonstrations on the 18th at the University of Colorado at 
Denver on the Science of Sound and Music in conjunction with the 
festival. Any microtonalists who will be in Denver October the 18th are 
urged to contact me if they wish to present a 25 minute talk or demo.
