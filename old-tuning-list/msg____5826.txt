From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu>

If one looks at the record in the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe of Thomas Atwood's
composition lessons with Mozart, one sees that Mozart starts him writing
out diatonic and chromatic scales, noting that a wholetone must contain
both a greater and a lesser semitone and that sharps are lower than the
enharmonic flats.  This without any reference to specific instruments.
To me this indicates Mozart tends to think in meantone.

(One also notes Mozart's tendency to call Atwood an ass when he makes
rather egregious part-writing errors. 8-)> )
