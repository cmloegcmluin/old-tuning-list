   First of all, Ensoniq's "pitch tables" cover the full range of MIDI
key#s, each independent of the others.  Each key may have any arbitrary
pitch you'd like it to, irrelevant of the pitches you assign to any of the
other keys.  (Well, each key's pitch is arbitrary within available pitch
resolution of course.)  Each instrument may have as many as 8 pitch tables
(although selecting more than four rapidly is a bit tricky).

   To set up a repeating pattern of pitches, such as 12-Toned Ptolemaic JI
in C, you enter the pitches for the keys C4 through C5.  You would set, for
example, E4 14 cents flat of the 12TET reference.  (Actually, that's not
exactly true;  you specify pitches between 0 and 99 cents above whatever
12TET pitch reference lies directly below it, so you'd define the E4 key
top play an Eb4 86 cents sharp.)  Notice that you set the pitch of both of
the C4 and of the C5, the C5 being an octave higher than the C4.

   You then tell it to "extrapolate" the pitch table from C4 to C5.  That
causes it to duplicate the pattern of pitches between C4 and B4 upon the
pitch you chose for C5, and again on C6, C7, C3, C2, etc.

   In my 88CET tuning scheme, what looks visually on the keyboard to be an
octave, instead spans a 7:4 (88CET's very-close approximation that is).  So
in 88CET I set C4 and C5 to be 7:4 apart, and when I extrapolate the table,
I get something that repeats in 7:4s instead of octaves.

   Now, 22TET...  You have a very basic question to answer before you can
set it up.  What keyboard mapping do you want?  How do you want pitches in
the tuning to map to keys on the keyboard?  A common way is to map them
"linearly", each key 1/22nd of an octave apart, mismatching octave
boundaries in the tuning with those on the keyboard.  If that's the way you
want to map it, then set the pitches of the keys C4 through Bb5 to
successive 22nds of an octave, and extrapolate your table from C4 to Bb5.

   Many of Ensoniq's "synthesizer" series, like their VFX (and
unfortunately unlike their samplers), have an additional pitch-table
function called "interpolate", which creates equal divisions.  So, to tune
22TET on the VFX, you...
1.  Tune Bb5 to an octave above C4.
2.  Interpolate the tuning between C4 and Bb5.  This sets the 22 pitches between
    those two keys to successive 22nds of an octave apart.
3.  Extrapolate the tuning from C4 to Bb5.  This duplicates the 22TET tuning
    that "interpolate" created between C4 and Bb5 across the whole MIDI range.

   An alternative to mapping keys linearly is to break the tuning into
several 12-toned subsets that can be mapped on octave boundaries, and
switch off between them using the patch-select keys.
