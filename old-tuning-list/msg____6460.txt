Yes, you're right about this.  But I've had some email correspondence
recently with Anne about playing the Kingma flute, which she now
uses.  Although, as she says, this instrument is not what one might
call a 24-ET instrument, it is specifically built, as a
'quarter-tone' flute, using Eva Kingma's key-on-key mechanism.  To my
knowledge this is the only specifically designed non-12-ET
commercially avaliable professional concert woodwind.  It is
certainly advertised by Osten-Brannen as the world's first 'fully
quarter-tone flute'.

Well, different manufacturers do different things.  Look for
example at O. Lee Gibson's book called 'Clarinet Acoustics' to see
the extent of these differences.  Two points on this are very
important. Firstly, as Johnny Reinhard rightly points out,  woodwind
and brasswind are instruments of semi-variable intonation. (ie., they
are not of fixed intonation, like the piano, nor are they without a
mechanism which encourages discrete steps, like the violin).
Woodwind performers instinctively adjust pitch as a matter of course,
in all music.  Secondly, manufacturers do go to some lengths the make
their instruments so that the scale is correct, and as near as
identical as possible on every instance of the same model.  What a
manufacturer considers 'correct' may vary very slightly.  But in
general, it seems that much effort is put into actually 'centering'
the resultant pitches which arise, by equalling out factors of breath
pressure in tests etc . And the 'model' is certainly 12-ET.  If this
were not the case, there would hardly be so much mathematical theory
for woodwind tone-hole design (even if, it won't necessarily give the
right results!!), nor computer programs for same.

I agree with this point entirely - although I didn't think it was the
point Johnny was making.  I thought he was saying that if
microtonality was taught properly, then musicians would be able to
play accurately in alternative tuning systems on conventional
instruments anyway, and therefore new instruments are unnecessary.
Did I misunderstand?
