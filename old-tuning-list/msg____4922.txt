     I must question this.  I would be very interested in learning who was
tuning equally tempered keyboards in the 1700's, and  how they were doing it.
  This date seems somewhat at odds with Hipkins' experience at Broadwood's, (
the English were not 100 years behind the times in temperament practises,
were they?)
     From what I have read, in Mozart's lifetime ET was the province of
theorists, but well-tempering practises went for another 100 years.  

      If I am missing something here,  I would appreciate  learning of
trustworthy resources that support the use of ET in the 18th century.
