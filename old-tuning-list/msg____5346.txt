That sure seems to be the question on everyone's mind in this list.  That's
why I posted it.  Has less to do with Wagner's music, than the trend he
embodied of artists inevstigating new proving ground, such as xenharmony as
it blossomed in the post-Romantic era, along with Nazism and
metamathematics.
Other tuning readers might notice that the whole shooting match was
considered a Wagner analysis.  Few more days until MayDay.
