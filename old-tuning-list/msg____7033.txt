Regarding Mr Mickey Mouse: On the Roland,  if you want to preserve a
any kind of realistic quality of timbre the upper limit of
transposing a sample from its original sampled pitch is about a
minor third (up), and a major third down - depending on the timbre.
In my own case, I typically use a sample mapped to no more than about
150 cents BELOW the original sampled pitch, but very seldom
transposed upward.   This is more than adequate for my purposes
(local friends think I'm too fussy) and there is no 'mickey mouse'
effect within these limits.

(Of course, you can get away with more than this if realism
is not important, - or you can do away with realism altogether and
transpose up (as far a two octaves) - and down (as far as you like).
The E4 is slightly  better better at preserving realism over a wider
range, but by no more than a semitone.  It can also transpose upward
over a much greater range, I believe).

Sorry, John, this is wrong.  Increasing the number of 'partials' has
no effect on the used sample RAM on the Roland or AKAI systems. (It
does on the EMU, but, as I understand, so little that it is
negligible). On the Roland -  suppose there are 4 samples in memory,
of flute tones, Eb4, F#4, A4 and C5; and that they take up 2Mb.  You
then create a 'one octave 41-ET'  flute, by creating 41 'partials'
which map each of 3 samples to 10 divisions of the scale, and the 4th
sample to the remaining 11 divisions, such that you can now play this
scale over 3 and a bit standard-keyboard-octaves.  The mapping from
sample to 'partial' is one-many, and you've still only used 2Mb RAM.
On the Roland there is no limit to the degree of one-many-ness,
excepting the limits on samples and 'partials' (512 and 255
respectively).  (Actually this is not quite right - the relation is
many-many, except that the maximum number of samples that can be
associated with any one 'partial' is 4.)

For your interest, there is also a 'micro-key-follow'
tuning facility in the Roland S7XX series, whereby you can
'interpolate' (to use Gary's 'Ensoniq' terminology) a 'partial'
across the (any part of the) keyboard in 1/8ths of a semitone, 2/8 of
same, 3/8, 4/8 (quarter tones), 5/8,7/8, 8/8 (12-ET), 9/8, etc up to
16/8 of a semitone (whole tones).

I agree entirely with the general points 1 and 2.  I'm unconvinced
however about the last sentence of this paragraph.  Samplers, if used
for anything approaching realism, will require significant amounts of
RAM whatever the 'partial'/zone architecture etc, at least until
some form of data compression of the 16 bit format is introduced (or
something). The fact that EMU have implemented 128Mb on the E4
seems to confirm this - they didn't build it for composers working
with ATS.  More 'partials' does not mean more RAM;  on the Roland
(at least) only samples take up sample RAM.

But I suspect you may have other (good) reasons for saying what you
do (?).

Thanks, Gary.  I've seen this sort-of kind-of thing on various
synths. Can I ask a further question?  I understand what you have
described, that is if you want one single sound (either a synthesised
sound or a sample) mapped to this kind of 'key-table'.  But, on the
Ensoniq sampler, if you want to achieve some simulatory realism
do you have to laboriously map each sample to a point or points on
the key-table - or is that not something that can be done (or is nor
worth the trouble etc)?  (Please excuse me, I'm aware of being
very biased toward wanting realism.  I know that's not what everyone
wants - and it should not bias this discussion.  But it's what
interests me about these machines!)

In my work I've created simulations of many of the standard
orchestral instruments for every n-ET between 13 and 36, (and some
others above, especially 41) in each case creating a single
partial-sample relationship for each pitch (!).  Creating them is one
thing - learning to play them all is another!  In most cases the
keyboard mapping I've used is simply 'keyboard-chromatic', since I
get used to re-remembering where the octaves (and everything else)
are. Anything less than but near to a multiple of 12, I cheat a bit,
and ditch a key somewhere.
