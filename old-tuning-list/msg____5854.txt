Neil, thanks for your interest. Once again, the 22-tone guitar is with
me for the long haul -- my little bits of 22-tone magic so far, some
conforming to my theories, others not, are really just the infancy of
something new, and I don't want to take any shortcuts in the learning
process. Sure, I've jammed on some 22-tone blues, etc., but that's not
what it's all about for me. Right now, I'm too busy with conventionally
tuned music and musicians to do what I will someday need to do -- shut
myself away from the diatonic outside world and really explore musical
space unhindered. I just turned 25 yesterday, and I guess it's keeping
me happy for now to keep surfing the 12-tone wave I'm riding -- there's
nothing like sharing a common musical language with musicians all over
the Western world (or what amounts to the same thing, Cambridge). I'm
not going to rush anything, and when the time is right, the 22-tone
>stuff will come together . . .
