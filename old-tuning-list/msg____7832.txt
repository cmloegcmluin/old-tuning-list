There are two main reasons that scholars have accepted for the
emergence of music theory in a system of tetrachords:

1)  Tetrachords provide the smallest _diatonic_  interval-structure
    that repeats.  In other words, in a diatonic scale, that is,
    one with steps of the sizes "tone" and "semitone", the interval
    structure of the four notes within a "perfect 4th" will contain
    one "semitone" and the rest are "whole tones".  This is the
    smallest diatonic unit that provides a "semitone", and thus the
    unique smaller step which identifies the structure.  In genera
    other than the diatonic, the tetrachord still encompassed the
    main identifying interval, be it a 6/5 in the chromatic, a
    5/4 in the enharmonic, or some other ratio of a "3rd".

2)  Ancient Greek was a tonal language, where the _pitch_  of a       
vowel affected its meaning (like modern Chinese).  It is
    assumed that during poetic speech, the "melody" of the phrase
    covered approximately the range of a "4th", thus this became
    the important unit to the Greeks.
