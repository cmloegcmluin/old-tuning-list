Subject: The Glechniszahlen-Reihe Monster
---
Along with the Sierpinski gasket and the
Wierstrass curve, the Gleichniszahlen-Reihe
Monster is one of the more interesting
number-theoretic constructs.
Consider the sequence:
1
1  1
2  1
1  2  1  1
1  1  1  2  2  1
..
Is there a pattern here?
The answer's embarassingly simple: row 2
is "one 1," referring back to the previous
row.  Row 3 is "2 ones," referring to row 2.
And so on.
This "likeness sequence" (a loose translation
of the German name) grows quickly.  Row 27,
for example, contains 2017 entries.
Clearly the Gleichniszahlen-Reihe Monster can
be generalized to any two relatively prime
numbers.  The monster then takes the form:
p  q
1  p  1  q
1  1  1  p  1  1  1  q
3  1  1  p  3   1  1  q
1  3  2  1  1  p  1  3  2  1  1  q
..
What does this have to do with tuning?
Well, the Gleichniszahlen-Reihe Monster
offers an attractive method of generating
modes from a tuning.  It also provides a
scheme for traversing ratio space to generate
scales (if the units of the sequence are 
considered as coordinates in ratio space).
Lastly, the Gleichniszahlen-Reihe Monster
could be used as a melodic engine for algorithmically
generating note-sequences in any tuning (if
the units of the sequence are considered as indices
of an array containing xenharmonic pitches).

Reihe," in Bild der Wissenschaft, vol. 12, 1986,
