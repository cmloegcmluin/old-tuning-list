This may not be what you're talking about, but there are several pages of
links to sites concerned with tuning.

sorry I dont have the proper quoting doolies:

Im personally interested anything & everything in this space that lends
itself to more interactive participation of all posters, lurkers, specialists
etc.  What I had in mind with my suggestion was more of a actually link page
of web sites, ftp sites, newsgroups, other mailinglists, of all who come here
regularly, EVEN IF IT DOESNT SPECIFICALLY REFER TO ALTERNATIVE TUNING.

reread my post from yesterday & the spelling errors make it sound like my
keyboard is gummed up with old coffee spills & fingernail clippings.  sorry
about that, any future submissions will be more closely edited.  I was
obviously on a jag...
