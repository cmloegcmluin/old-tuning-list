Subject: Pitch-tracking software

From: Alexandre Enkerli <enkerli@iname.com>

Hello all.
I'm wondering about other people's experience with pitch-tracking 
software. For example, Wildcat Canyon claims that their Autoscore Pro 2.0 
package is able to track pitch-bend. How accurate is it?
Also, there are a couple of Mac programs that track pitch. Some of them 
are not that bad. And some people have interesting ideas such as 
VocalLab, a pitch-training program that displays variation to 12ET notes.
