Subject: why ET's

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Actually, that is an interesting question. If I am not mistaken, the 
original impetus for developing eq temps in western music was to be able 
to modulate to distant keys, and be somewhat in tune. The history of 
meantone and well temperaments seems to bear that out. Using Papa Bach as 
a prime example, his music would have been impossible to realize in any 
sort of pure tunings. So would jazz, or any music with more than a few 
chord changes...and, I love music with chord changes.
    As to the comment that we now have keyboards that can play pure 
tunings, that's great for keyboard players, but maybe not for the rest of 
the musicians in the world who play other axes.
   And, Marion's comment that he thought people gravitated to eq temps 
because they were "easier"...easier in what way? I certainly admit that 
pure tuning understanding is a vast and endless subject...I am working 
toward that goal daily, and it's a long haul. However,do we mean, by 
easier, intellectual understanding, or the performance of great music? If 
we mean performance, than I must frankly say that much music in pure 
tunings that I've heard is abysmal, more of an attempt to demonstrate the 
tuning rather than to be a great musician. This is referred to as 
microdoodling (in some places). I'm not so sure that modulating through a 
cycle of major or minor 3rds in 34 tone eq, and writing a killer chord 
progression off of same cycle, and then improvising (or composing) a 
great solo over those changes, is terribly easy. This is one of my future 
projects, and it is a bear. Again, musician and theorist surely overlap 
in places, but too often, in my experience, there's a lot of talk about 
tunings, much of which is quite advanced, but little advanced music to 
back up the talk. 
    Much great music has been made in 12 eq, and I am listening to some 
killer flamenco as I write...yes, I am bored to tears with 12 eq, but you 
"just" champions better get on the ball, then, and do some serious 
playing and composing, instead of chattering...then, your words will have 
more real depth and meaning...Hstick  (PS...and certainly, such folks as 
Lou Harrison, the Reinhards, Catler Bros, John Schneider, and a few 
others, have made great "just" music...not to mention the zillions of 
Indian, Arabic, and Turkish musicians who have been doing so for 
thousands of years)...(PS 2...my friend Ernie Crews had a dream a while 
back that the "just intonation" folks had taken over the world, and had 
outlawed eq temps...ho ho)
