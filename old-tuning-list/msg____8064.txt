The Yamaha (the one at Yale's CSMT, Adam Silverman should be able to
tell us which one) did have FM capabilities. However, I didn't think of
that as "synthesis from scratch." Looking back at Gary's query, however,
I see that he would indeed qualify it.

Yamaha's synthetic waveforms are themselves FM-based, and can be used to
FM one another.
