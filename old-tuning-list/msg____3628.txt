Subject: Why I use == temperament

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

REplying to Paul E on Sept. 9:

>>What if the seventh of the dominant seventh chord *is* in the melody?

Harold, why do you use equal temperaments at all? It it only for 
convenience?

-------------
1) I find that if the seventh of the V7 is approached or left by intervals
of a whole step or less, that it works pretty well melodically

2) Since I frequently compose music by organizing ideas found through
improvisation, I find equal temperaments more conducive, especially since
I like rather chromatic harmony. However, since much of my theorizing about
microtonal composition is based on the proximity of irrational ratios to
rational ratios, I may well compose some JI music in the near future.

And to reply to Gary Morrison--in a IV, V7, I progression, I would have the
tonic of IV descend to the 7/4 over V for the V7, and then let it resolve in
its usual manner.

Equally and temperamentally yours,
Harold
