I have to agree with Gary that San Diego is much less hectic
and less crowded than LA, and also nowhere near as big.  In
addition, it has the best freeway system of any city I've
known, so gridlock is not bad (only a little, at rush hours).

I haven't gotten the chance to visit the LA microtonalists
yet, but it certainly does seem to me that there's a very
active bunch of us here in San Diego.  There hasn't been a
strong focal center for them since Ivor Darreg died, until
now -- that's what we're working to create at Sonic Arts.

Bill Alves, however, made some very salient points.  Although
we are glad to offer our resources at Sonic Arts, it has nowhere
near the facilities that a college can offer, and that's important
if this is going to happen on as large a scale as it looks like
it might.  Perhaps I can talk to my connections at UCSD, but
I'd go with Bill's college.

And as for a special dinner, I'd like to add that some of the
most enjoyable and most informative aspects to attending Johnny
Reinhard's AFMM festivals in New York were the "post mortems"
(as Wendy Carlos called them), where a fairly large group of
us went to dinner after the concerts and talked tuning-ese.
