Actually, I'm not concentrating on any particular systems. I'm suggesting that it's a simpler organizing 
principle to consider the audio spectrum as the pitch resource rather than any individual pitch system which 
must then be forced into all duties including analytic. The latter is something that bugs me about Charles 
Lucy's claims for his (adopted) system, which I told him in conversations when I met him. He says the Lucy 
system can be used to approximate other scales of the world. My question is: Why bother; why not just use the 
scale you're trying to approximate? Tuning systems are guides into the infinite resource, they are not that 
resource. They provide a way of drawing individual choices from the daunting infinity of possibilites; a way 
to get started. I'm interested in tuning systems because each suggests a way of hearing, and I enjoy hearing 
in different ways. I am however just as interested in drawing pitches from the infinite resource using my ear 
and inspiration, and analyzing it later if need be. Beauty often has an underlying mathematical structure, and 
mathematical structure often appears beautiful, as Joseph Schillinger pointed out, which probably says 
something about the construction of mind. While it's entirely valid to construct a pitch set using some formal 
process and then see what music we can make out of it, we shouldn't forget that pitched music is neither 
limited to nor necessarily described by that particular formal process.

Who said anything about picking pitches chaotically (although that sounds really interesting, see below)? I 
had a feeling responding to an analogy might have been a bad idea. Your analogy means something specific to 
you which it didn't suggest to me, and misunderstanding ensued. Oh well. 
 
Speaking of chaos, I have found a few places on the web where you can download and listen to fractal sounds, 
including this site which uses the pixels values from a sequential scan of a Mandelbrot rendering to choose 
from a (not choatically derived) pitch set (a 6-note octave-repeating scale in 12tet: 0 2 4 7 9 11, or 
x.x.x..x.x.x, or a major scale without the 4th degree). I'd be interested to hear what it would sound like 
with a chaotically derived pitch set.

Here's a good starting place for finding fractal music on the web:
