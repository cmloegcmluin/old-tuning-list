Subject: Yamaha TX802 Tunings?

From: Steven Sauve <synthguy@interlog.com>

Greetings...I'm a rookie here, and my first interest is finding Alt 
Scales for the Yamaha TX802...i've checked the Mills FTP site, but it 
seems fairly void of anything...are there others out there?...


thanks,

..ALIVE AND WELL for as LONG as I can REMEMBER...
