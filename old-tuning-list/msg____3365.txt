Subject: Re: TUNING digest 798

From: rrcp@qnet.com (tom speer)

Sorry if this is to the wrong address but I accidently deleted my "tuning" 
directory.
I tried to unsubscribe once before (I did use the proper commands) when I 
still had the faq but for some reason it didnt work and I received NO 
improper format reply etc.
Please either unsubscribe me or send unsubscribe info and I will try again. 
Thanks in advance
