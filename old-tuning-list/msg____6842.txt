Subject: 19 TET - where does it begin?

From: "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com>

I'm thinking about how to retune my diatonic pedal steel (see
http://wco.com/~quasar/tunings/fscale12.htm ) to 19TET.  I tune with a Korg
chromatic tuning meter that measures the variations from 12TET in cents.

The question becomes "Where does 19TET begin?".  Since my tuning is in F, it
would be pretty easy to do the calculations with F as the starting point.
On the other hand, most music today uses A=440Hz as a starting point.  Is
that appropriate for 19TET as well?

I realize, of course, that any starting point will work.  My question is
whether there is an established pitch that I should start with, or does
everyone using 19TET define their own starting point?

Also, regarding Gregg Gibson's assertion that the octave should be stretched
a few cents, wouldn't this be a problem for guitar players (and steel
guitarists) who are accustomed to sounding harmonics to get an octave above
the note they are fingering (or barring)?  I also suspect that there would
be a lot of beats happening around double- and triple-octave pairs.  If the
bass player plays an A, and my A three octaves higher adds 10 cents to the
equation, I wouldn't expect it to sound good.

One final, unrelated note - I suffered a hard disk crash last week that
destroyed my e-mail archive.  I lost all of the addresses of people from
this group with whom I had been corresponding.  Please ping me at
quasar@wco.com to restart our conversation.  Neil and Gary - I got the
cassettes and I'm really enjoying them.  Thanks!
