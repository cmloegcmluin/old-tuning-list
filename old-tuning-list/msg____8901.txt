Subject: updates to my website

From: monz@juno.com

- My website has a new look,

- the microtonal dictionary just keeps growing:

http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/define.htm

You might want to bookmark it, and please send 
me your own definitions.  I'm going to cite anything
I get that's worthwhile.  It's a great opportunity
to exchange links.

- and the main paper that explains my theory now
     finally looks good.  It should give a nice
     print-out, especially in color:
