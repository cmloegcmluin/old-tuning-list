   Speaking for my own experience, I don't concur with that whatsoever.  I
don't find 7:6 to be unpleasant or beating at all.  (And I certainly have a
lot of experience with 7:6, since my current main microtonal fascination
approximates it well, and uses it as one of several basic building blocks).

   In comparison to 6:5, I find that 7:6 is no less discordant, but it is
certainly darker in character, and has a certain "zap" sensation in place
of 6:5's sweetness.

   Now Gregg spoke earlier about splitting a fifth in the same sense that
an interval and its inversion split an octave.  He seemed to suggest that
if you split up a consonant interval such that one of the two intervals is
discordant, that the other must be discordant.  I think that that's a risky
overgeneralization.  For example, I find 7:6 to be much less discordant
than 9:7, and I personally think that 8:7 sounds about as "good"
("consonant" if you'd like) as anybody could expect a second to sound.

   That being said, I personally think that, although "dissonant" may be a
livable choice of adjectives to describe 9:7, two that describe it better
to my ears are "shocking" and "startling".

   And also related to septimals, I don't find 7:4 to be even slightly
discordant.  I have described it over the list as like "a fifth with an
attitude".  Now I freely acknowledge that that's a self-contradictory
description because of the obvious fact that 7:4 isn't ANY kind of fifth
(except maybe a way-sharp augmented one!).  Still to my ears 7:4's auditory
effect has some curious similarities with 3:2's.  I don't know if I can put
those similarities into words any better than this:  As with 3:2 or 2:1,
7:4 fuses pitches very tightly, and its lack of the sweetness of major and
minor thirds and sixths makes it seem quasi-perfect.  But unlike any
perfect interval, it has a flourescent "zap" much like 7:6's, which is the
"attitude" part.
