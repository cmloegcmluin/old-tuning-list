Subject: Mbira festival

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Perhaps the 4-day festival that De IJsbreker organises about the
African mbira is interesting for the Dutch subscribers. It's held from
Thursday 14 March to Sunday 17 March. There are concerts, workshops,
lectures (by Paul Berliner), videofilms and an exhibition. Works were
written specially for the festival by Peter van Bergen, Ron Ford and
Maarten Altena. The concerts feature contemporary music from Africa 
and Europe. More information:
