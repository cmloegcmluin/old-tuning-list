Subject: seminar announcement in Ithaca NY

From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu>

In case any of you are going to be in the Ithaca area
this week, I am giving a talk at Cornell University that discusses
various aspects of "Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale."
It'll be interesting to see how engineers and tuning theory
react to each other...

Date:     Feb 20 1:30 pm, Phillips Hall

Title:    Perception-Based Audio Signal Processing

Speaker:  Bill Sethares

Abstract:

At the intersection of signal processing, music, and psychology lies
perception-based audio processing, which investigates the
relationships between the structure of sounds, the structure of music,
and the underlying biological/perceptual aspects of the human
auditory system.

The talk begins by showing how to build a device that can measure
the "sensory" consonance and/or dissonance of a sound in its musical
context. As shown in my recent book "Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum,
Scale", such a "dissonance meter'' has implications in music theory, in
synthesizer design, in the construction of musical scales and tunings,
and in the design of musical instruments.

The talk then examines some of the signal processing problems that
arise when trying to manipulate sounds so as to remain faithful to
psychoacoustic principles. These involve complex (and sometimes ill-
posed) optimization problems, as well as (nonlinear and/or time
varying) algorithms designed to decrease (or increase!) the
dissonance of a sound. In particular, we discuss various "spectral
mapping" algorithms that try to move the partials of a sound without
changing its "character".

Sound examples are present throughout.
