hello,

can i jump in a second?  i'm no representative of astrology (or physics),
but my impression of the field is that there are forces much larger/deeper
that act on all things, including the stars and planets used by astrologers.
not that the weak forces exerted by same stars and planets are the sole
governors of our fates.
