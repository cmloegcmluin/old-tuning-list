Yes, Giovanni Gabrieli (c.1553/56-1612) is famous for his "Canzoni da sonare"
canzonas for brass choir. He wrote 36 of them which were published between
1597 and 1615. Although he specified ecclesiastical modes for them,
the tonality approaches the major/minor concept. He was organist in
the San Marco of Venice and pupil of his uncle Andrea Gabrieli. 
I can recommend performances of Hesperion XX (on EMI Reflexe though 
it may be out of print) and also the Netherlands Wind Ensemble.
The Italian composer Luca Francesconi (1956) is also crazy about 
these canzonas and has them influence his compositions, for example
Risonanze d'Orfeo.
And I suppose I don't tell anything new when I mention that Purcell has 
a beautiful canzona in Music for the funeral of Queen Mary.
