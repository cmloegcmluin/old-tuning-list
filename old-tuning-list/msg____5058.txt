I posted this to the list on Monday, but never received my copy from the 
Tuning list server, so I'll assume no-one else received it. Apologies if 
you've seen it before, or if you think it was hardly worth posting in 
the first place.

Just to avoid any further possible misunderstandings on this matter, 
I'll repeat what I said in an earlier message: within the tuning 
environments of well-temperament and 12TET, while there is of course no 
acoustic distinction between the pitches C# and Db, this does not 
prevent us from making functional distinctions in our notational system. 
But this has nothing to do with the matter under discussion. Functional 
distinctions only exist within a relational system. Now if Beethoven had 
been speaking of pitches within a piece, or even of keys arrived at by 
means of modulation within a piece, then such a system would have 
provided the context for talk of functional distinctions. But Beethoven 
was talking about Db major and C# major in vacuo, as the tonics of a 
piece, and therefore outside such relational systems, and so not 
amenable to functional distinctions. What else is left if we cannot 
distinguish the keys on grounds of acoustic difference (as is the case 
in WT or 12TET), nor on the grounds of notational-functional 
distinctions? Again, I offered the other possibility in previous 
messages -- arbitrary associations of keys with various pieces, 
instruments etc (I'll put synaesthesia in this category too: while 
individuals, such as Messiaen, feel their associations to be necessary, 
each synaesthesiac differs). Beethoven's statement would seem to fall 
firmly into this last category.

So if not acoustic differences, nor notational-functional differences, 
nor arbitrary associations, then what?

Obfuscation, nothing else.

By the way, if anyone can locate the Beethoven quotation, I'd be 
grateful.
