Sorry if you misunderstood academic manners -- an "adversarial" stance 
is adopted only in order to sharpen arguments (granted, the temperature 
can rise somewhat if a lucidly stated argument is distorted). 
Furthermore, I've strongly hinted before that I'm playing devil's 
advocate -- I'm not against what you say, but I want to hear the best 
possible arguments for the case, so that even the most dogged and 
sceptical supporter of the 18th-century ET thesis will be convinced.

Here's an example, I think, of the adversarial game drawing out a better 
argument. In reply, I suppose one might ask why a fretted string 
instrument could not then be used as a point of reference by the 
keyboard tuner. But otherwise I'm satisfied on this matter.

So what you would want to establish is that 18th-century keyboard tuners 
considered the achievement of ET, accurate beyond audible margins of 
error, considered such a hopeless task that it was not worth attempting. 
If so, I trust that we would eventually be able to find some recorded 
statements to this effect.

I'm afraid that this, and much else that you've said, goes no further 
than to say that well-temperament was a possibility for this music. But 
I never argued with this. What I was asking you to do, rather, was to 
back up your categorical statement that equal temperament was _not_ used 
at all (as a keyboard tuning) in Germany/Austria c.1800. I suspect by 
now that you said all you can on this matter, and I thank you for this. 

My concern is simply that there is not so far any case which would 
withstand scrutiny as an academic paper; since your interests are 
practical rather than academic, you may not be worried by this. But it 
will prove a difficult task, since at present revisionists such as 
Rudolf Rasch, are (as Manuel Op de Coul reminded us) prepared even to 
say that Bach might indeed have intended the WTK for equal temperament, 
notwithstanding all that has been argued to the contrary. If respected 
academics are still prepared to place ET (as a keyboard tuning) back 
even as far as the 1720s, there is a great deal to be done before we can 
hope to establish the counter-thesis that ET didn't begin to emerge as a 
practical possibility (for keyboards) until at least a century later. 
Whatever the merits of Rasch's case, there is a very long way to go 
before the historical case for the prevalence of well-temperament into 
the 19th century has been established. There are two routes by which we 
can attack the consensual thesis that ET was well-nigh universal in 
Germany/Austria by 1800: one is to provide convincing documentary 
evidence to the contrary from contemporary sources (I've still seen 
nothing in this respect); the other is to shift the burden of proof onto 
those following the consensual thesis, by demonstrating that ET was so 
far beyond the capabilities of 18th-century tuners that its supposed 
establishment by 1800 is most improbable (you have said a couple of 
things which move in this direction). Does anyone know of more material, 
or can anyone suggest further arguments which would contribute to either 
of these possible lines of attack?

Meantone? Yes, probably 1/6-comma from good string players, and on some 
keyboards (it was Silbermann's choice), but I thought we were talking 
about well temperament. Was this a typo?

In any case, would you agree then that for music which modulates freely, 
but which remains locally diatonic in most passages (as in Beethoven), 
well-temperaments are best, but where local chromaticism becomes more 
prevalent (as in later Chopin), then equal temperament is more 
satisfactory?

Definitely a typo here (op. 39 Preludes "durch alle Tonarten"). The date 
of composition is thought to have been 1789 -- certainly a later Bonn 
work -- so the opus number, 39, is misleading in this respect. In this 
case, even if (contrary to your view) ET was prevalent by 1800, there is 
still a fairly high probability that in relatively provincial Bonn, well 
temperament would still have been much in evidence at this date. Tuning 
matters aside, I find it particularly interesting that the two preludes 
traverse the circuit of keys in different ways: the first reaches C# 
major by fifths, then manages to reverse all of this and more in a 
wonderful chromatic passage to arrive on a genuine Db major (genuine in 
the sense that it is not just a notational convenience), whereupon the 
fifths sequence resumes until the final (genuine) C major is reached. 
The second prelude, maintains the fifths sequence throughout, and passes 
through the cycle twice, so removing changes due to notational 
convenience, we pass from C major to A*# major. The first prelude even 
manages to maintain a high level of inventiveness, and deserves to be 
heard more often on the concert platform.
