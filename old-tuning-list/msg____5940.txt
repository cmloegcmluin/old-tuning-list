Subject: Notation for 19 and 31tET proposals

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

In response to the query about notation for 19 and 31 tET.

I propose the following method.  Notation for 19 and 31 tET is really
simple.

If you use the Large (L) and small (s) interval patterns.

One octave is 5 large plus 2 small = 5L+2s

In 19 equal Large interval (L) is 3/19ths of an octave
and small interval (s) is 2/19ths.
Therefore 5 Large (*3)= 15/19ths plus 2 small (*2) = 4/19ths = One
Octave.

In 31 equal Large interval is 5/31sts of an octave and small interval is
3/31sts.
Therefore 5 Large (*5)= 25/31sts plus 2 small (*3) = 6/31sts = One
Octave.

So just like LucyTuning, you can now use conventional notation to
describe your music, except that as ET's are circular (instead of
spiral),
and therefore in 19tET Fb and E#: and Cb and B# will play the same note.

So in 19tET, the available notes will be:
C C# Db D D# Eb E (Fb/E#) F F# Gb G G# Ab A A# Bb B (Cb/B#)
and in 31tET, the available notes will be:

C Dbb C# Db Cx D Ebb D# Eb Dx E Fb E# F Gbb F# Gb Fx
G Abb G# Ab Gx A Bbb A# Bb Ax B Cb B#
I suggest that you use A4 = 440 Hz as your reference pitch.

(which is under development)

They have lotsa

P.S.  I have examined many of the new notation systems, and have come to
the conclusion that the best suggestions to date come from Anne and Bill
Collins.
Bill is the ASCAP writer of "Without You".
They solve many of the
shortcomings of conventional notation by using close and wide line spacing
on the staves, plus lotsa other "neat" ideas, which enable their system to
be "music" rather than instrument biased fingering systems like
klavier(sp?).
