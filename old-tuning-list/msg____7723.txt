Subject: LiSa Sftwr Samplerw/microtuning,$250!

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hello Everyone,

If you already know about this,please forgive the long post.It's just =
so cool,I had to make sure everyone knows.

LiSa (Live Sampling) by STEIM is a real-time audio manipulation =
environment that runs on any
Macintosh or Mac-compatible computer with a Power PC (PPC) processor.

Upto 64 voices,depending on cpu speed.
28 voice polyphony on an 8500/120,
12 on a 6100/66,
10 onq 5300/117PowerBook.

No additional hardware required

Handles 44.1k mono samples on ea.voice.
Also does real-time mono sampling like a very fancy digital delay.

How many samples it can hold is somewhat unusual ,essentially =
unlimited 
,and very flexible with direct & arbitrary access to any sample (or =
portion thereof) that is in the buffer.

OMS/MIDI manager compatible.

Needs 4MB RAM for LiSa itself,plus user defined RAM for  samples.

Each of the 128 MIDI notes can be tuned to any pitch in the range of =
0-12000 cents, thus making it possible for each MIDI note to play at =
any pitch within
LiSa=B9s entire range.  These pitch tables are stored at the Preset =
level, meaning that each Preset can hold 16 pitch tables, one for =
each channel.

 The file you load when you start up the program is called a Setup. =
Every Setup is comprised of up to
128 Presets. A Preset is what you are actually working with at any =
one time when
programming or performing with LiSa.

So,you can have access to (16 * 128) 2048 arbitrary tunings at a time =
!

Plus,Pitch bend range of 0 to 60 semitones.

It has a very full MIDI implementation,with access to numerous =
parameters.


Doesn't have much in the way of efx, has fuzz,a pseudo-resonator,and =
elaborate control over the samples themselves.

Cost :1392 French Francs.(@US $250)
