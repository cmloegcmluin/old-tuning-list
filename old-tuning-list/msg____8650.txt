HI,

Sorry for the delay with my 2 cents. I haven't had access to the
internet for over a week,
and when I did yesterday I had to do it on Windows, an absurd program
called
Explorer, and an absolutely idiotic-unintuitive mail (apparently)
program called Outlook (which managed to destroy some of my mail). 
Coincidentally all 3 apps are made by the same obscure North-West
American company.

I don't know much about all this yet, but might what Brad is talking
about and Sethares' approach be achieved using additive synthesis ?

It just seems the logical solution.

There's bound to be a lot of info on the mighty mighty infobahn about
additive. Greg Sandell's  SHARC Timbre database also (I think) has some
info
that is of use, since there's been mention on the Sharc list about
people using
the data to build sounds in the Kawai K-5000 additive synths (I wonder
if they 
have any microtuning capability) <http://www.parmly.luc.edu/sandell/>.

If you don't have access to any real-time additive synthesis system
(Kyma, 
K-5000, MSP,etc.) , there's always building samples in any of the free
software 
synthesis systems  (Csound, Syd, etc.) and loading them
into a sampler like Vsamp<http://www.kagi.com/smaug/vsamp> 
(on a PowerMac).

BTW, Kyma is now just $3300 for the base unit (four 80 MHz dsps, 96 MB
RAM
, digital i/o) and it's new and improved:
"Based on the new Motorola DSP-56309 chip running at 80 MHz, the
Capybara 
320 base unit is now available for US$3300 and provides a minimum of
four DSPs 
(expandable to 28) with multi-channel I/O, synchronization to external
clocks, and 
96 MB of sample RAM (expandable to 672 Mb) in a low-noise,
rack-mountable package 
connected to a desktop or laptop Macintosh or Windows PC."
<http://www.symbolicsound.com> This beaut is getting more and more 
affordable (compared to many of the commercial synths and samplers
around,it's
actually cheap !) and powerful......
