>The Bach "chestnut," as Reinhard said, is rather enduring, it seems.

        Somewhere, in a cyber-corner of space, a motley crew of harmonic
hobos gather around the  warm ,glowing list with the low flames and alluring
coals.  They begin to hammer once again on the chestnut..............

     I agree.  with one obsessive/compulsive flag.  It is very difficult to
believe that ET was tuned on a keyboard before 1830.  I say this because I
know how hard it is to tune ET today, with all the checks and balances that
were perfected in the late 1800's.  According to the research done by Barbour
and Jorgensen, there was no evidence of the  tools necessary to tune ET being
used before that time.
       I would defy anyone to aurally tune a temperament on a piano,
harpsichord, or clavichordy today that is equal without the use of the thirds
as measurment intervals.  I can't do it, and I am real familiar with 12 TET.
  You simply cannot tune ET on a strung keyboard  using fifths and octaves.
 The M3-min3 and M3-sixth tests are needed.
       The M3rd/sixth test is also useful for testing the widths of fourths,
( and will actually tune a guitar in very close ET if you know how to count
the beats at the G-B third).
     Hipkins tells us that ET was nowhere near practised at the Broadwood
factory in 1848, by the best tuners there !!
>From Jorgensen, we read that Mersenne himself said that the ratios for ET he
is credited with publishing (1635?) could not be used in tuning a clavier.
 Organs, which could sustain a long enough tone to count the beats, could be
tuned in ET, but nobody seemed to like it.
     Lutes, with  linear placement of the frets rendering any mathematically
described temperament possible, were perhaps the first truly equally tempered
Western instrument, along with the viols.

>also know that Handel had a keyboard with, I believe, 16 tones/octave...was
>this a common practice then?
     The physical limitations of the human hand seem to have limited the
number of keys for ordinary use. There have been many versions of more than
12 tried, but none seem to have been accepted for long.

      I remember reading that he could retune his clavier in 15 minutes, I
suspect that refers to changing the enharmonic notes.  Also I remember a
quote from one of Bach's sons, stating that the old man would not have
preferred ET.
     This is somewhat hazy, as the smouldering coals get raked,  there is a
chestnut in here,  I just know it........
