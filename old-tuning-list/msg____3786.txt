Subject: More beating Intervals

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

While trying to determine the source of the discrepancies between
my numbers and Manuel's, I recomputed my earlier table and got the
same results. However, it occurred to me that my approach does not
distinguish between intervals that are sharp from those that are
flat, or in other words, between intervals beating because they are to
narrow or too large. Hence, there are two solutions to each of the
relations; one where the beat rates are due to intervals both sharp
or flat, and one where they are dissimilar. I have thus added a
column of "Equal and Opposite" tunings for these new results.


Beating Intervals	Equal		Equal & Opposite

1. 4th = min 6th        695.8096      	697.1769
2. 4th = Maj 6th        696.2958	692.1612,  too flat?
3. min 6th= Maj 6th     696.0063        698.1741
4. 5th = Maj 3rd        695.6304	697.2785       
5. 5th = min 3rd        695.8096      	693.3588, too flat?
6. Maj 3rd = min 3rd    695.7294	(629.9748, unacceptable!)	
7. min 3rd = min 6th    698.8781        695.9340
8. 4th = Maj 3rd        697.4747       	695.2284
9. 5th = min 6th        697.0390        696.0237

My approach is based on Rasch's beat rate formulae where x is the 
temperer and S=81/80. The tempered fifths thus equal 3x/2. The 
"register-free" beat  rates of the various intervals are as follows:

Fifth 		3x - 3
Fourth 		4/x - 4
Major 3rd 	5Sx^4 - 5
Minor 3rd	6/Sx^3 - 6
Major 6th	5Sx^3 - 5
Minor 6th	8/Sx^4 - 8

Tunings are defined by taking pairs of these relations and setting
one equal to the other or to the negative of the other. Thus #4 
where the Fifth beats at the same rate as the Major third is defined 
by the formulae 3x - 3 = 5Sx^4 - 5 and 3x - 3 = 5 - 5Sx^4. Solve these
equations for x, then multiply by 3/2 to get the decimal fraction for 
the tempered fifth  and then multiply this value by some convenient 
pitch base such as C261.625 hz. From this frequency, one may compute 
the difference between the 3rd partial of the tonic and 2nd of the 
tempered fifth. This value is 0 for x=1. 

Beat rates of the  other intervals are calculated by generating them
from tempered fifths by the traditional Pythagorean cycles. Beat 
rates are then determined from the lowest (nearly) coincident partials 
as above.
