For that matter, once or twice I've Christopher Franke use a somewhat
xenharmonic sound when scoring _Babylon Five_: it sounds like he's
feeding a basic drone through a filter that's set just below ringing,
then sweeping the filter up slowly so that it "brings out" successive
partials one after another.  The partials are of course in small integer
ratios to one another, so one could think of this as very rudimentary
JI.
