Traditional diatonic music uses 7-note scales and 5-limit harmony.
In this context tritones are dissonant.  The simplest 5-prime
limit ratios are 25/18 and 36/25, or (-1 -2 2)H and (2 2 -2)H.
The latter comprises two minor thirds 6/5 or (1 1 -1)H.  That
means it must be a kind of fifth.

The difference between these quintal tritones is just over a 19th
of an octave.  That means they're well represented in 19-equal
and the difference is melodically important.  Staff notation is
a consistent way of notating quintal intervals, so the distinction
is preserved.

When a tritone is used in isolation, or is treated as consonant,
the best tuning is septimal.  The difference between 10/7 and
7/5 is only 35 cents.  7/5 is chosen as the augmented fourth
because it's the smaller.  However, as this isn't a diatonic
interval, there's no standard way of notating it.  The obvious
example is a 4:5:6:7 chord.  For 7/5 to be an augmented 4th,
7/4 must be an augmented sixth.  If you're writing septimal music
in meantone temperament or notation, you have to be aware of this.
Unfortunately, most composers do treat 10/7 and 7/5 as enharmonies,
so the usual notation of 7/4 is as a minor seventh.  You have to
work out from the context whether a 7th chord should be quintal or
septimal.
