   Just as a side note, for most keys with less than 4 accidentals, even
quarter-comma meantone (12 tone per octave that is) would probably work fairly
well.  

   I have had definite, but limited, exposure to well temperaments.  I
personally have come to the conclusion that the differences between most well
temperaments and 12TET are certainly significant, but ultimately not all THAT
big.  

   Then again, along with all of the other factors - timbre, musical style,
tempo, and others - there's another factor you need to consider in weighing
answers from tuning listers:  How wildly different from 12TET are the tunings
they've dealt with?  In my case, they've been pretty darned different.  

   To an American, Arabic and Eskimo culture seem pretty different, but to a
Martian the difference would seem real subtle!
