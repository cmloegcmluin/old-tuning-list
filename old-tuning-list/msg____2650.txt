Subject: Bitter criticism

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

I want to jump on this issue before anything gets out of hand, and append my 
comments on the new CD of Partch's "Bitter Music".  I did not intend to 
support serious censorship of a performance, but rather pose the 
consideration that Partch's music must be gingerly presented, since it 
treads the fine line between high art and folk art.  I am of the opinion 
that it could (and must) be judged, therefore, with the high standards we 
use to review a concert of any fine opera.

Most people cannot play piano, and their opinion of "Bitter Music" will 
therefore be based on a recorded version.  This version should therefore 
be only of the utmost passionate and skillful rendering.  Perhaps someone 
should take this journal and make it into a grainy film, starring Tom 
Waits as Harry, with the piano parts arranged for guitar, harmonium, and 
viola.

As I said before, I am not a critic except in my own armchair, and I 
probably should have kept this judgement between my dog and myself. 
Although I stand by my opinion of the work's rendering, I apologize to 
Warren for the unwarranted confrontation.  I appreciate his efforts to 
get the work before more people, and hope that no hard feelings linger.

Adam
