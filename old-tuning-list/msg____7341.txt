"no one would use a C# and a Db in the same piece."

Perhaps not on a keyboard, but with a recorder or some other instrument
they might.  I believe I noticed this in the Handel recorder sonata in F
major.  However, I do not have it handy.  Certainly Jon Catler uses this
technique when he writes for bassoon, allowing me to get notes that are
not found on the guitar.

Incidentally, I am doing a polymicrotonal improv with English hornist and
microtonalist Emanuelle Somer from Belgium at the Knitting Factory on
Thurs. April 3 at 7 pm in N.Y.  We had great success earlier this year
playing for a composer's organization.  Essentially, we work very hard
together to find out what the other can do and we work out a myriad of
pitch, timbre, and structural ideas.  When it's time to perform?  well
we're 1 for 1.
