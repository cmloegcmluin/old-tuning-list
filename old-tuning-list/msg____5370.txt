All I said and meant was that there is no just 81:80 in any ET. Terribly 
obvious. But your elaboration is more interesting:

In any ET, we would agree that the perfect

We might not, but let's for the moment.

We would also agree that the

I agree that we may define crucial consonances as closest to just in an ET
(usually representing the pure harmonics, with a power of 2 in the
denominator, in case anyone else isn't sure what we are talking about). 
After that, I would start (not necessarily conclude) by defining such
things as commas in structural terms. They are left over as differences
between multiples of harmonics. The syntonic comma has a standard
definition; often it comes out positive or zero, sometimes it is negative.
To say that it may not be the closest to 21.5 cents is certainly true but 
is not affected by the structural definition. If you don't keep the same
definition across tunings, you can't compare what is being defined, as 
your subsequent demonstration shows.

[two usually equivalent definitions omitted, one for m3s, one for M3s]

Perhaps not relevant, but it would. There are plenty of tunings where 
there may be a choice of P5, and we may prefer the one which is farther 
from just for one of several reasons.

If you don't try to make dissonances define themselves like consonances,
it's not necessary.

This I find most interesting, and I must get back to your notion of 
consistency when I have time to return to the theory. Of course, if a m3 
is defined in terms of a M3 and P5, this discrepancy will never come up. 
Still, the m3 is valuable enough that the problem you mention is worth 
consideration. I tried to do so, in fact, in my 25-tET piece, because it 
has two viable m3s, at 288 cents and 336 cents.

Obviously [!], if a syntonic comma is defined only one way (the difference
between four P5s and a M3), there will be only one result.
