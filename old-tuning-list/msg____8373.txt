From: <Nangaku@aol.com>

A web search for "Fractal Music" came up with many sites, although the ones I
checked out sounded like 12 ET.  There is one site that I think I heard of
from this tuning list that has fractal microtonal music which is at

I don't know anything about how it is composed, but I'd also love to hear
anyone's thoughts on how fractals relate to tuning.
