Just thought I'd add that I see adds for used Yamaha DX7-II keyboards, like the one 
I have, in the local used-stuff paper in Los Angeles for $300 to $500. It holds 2 
user tunings which are complete per-note tunings, that is 128 midi triggerable or 
61 keyboard triggerable pitches each tunable across the instrument's range (8 
octaves?) to a resolution of 1024 Yamaha tuning units per octave. If one were to 
purchase an additional memory cartridge, something like 40 additional user tunings 
may be stored. Of course, using the midi tuning dump lets you store endless scales 
on a computer or generate them in real time for transposition fun.
