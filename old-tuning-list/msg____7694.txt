Subject: Just intonation/Logic Audio Discovery V.3.0

From: Rikta Hawkins <hawkinsr@ccgs.wa.edu.au>

Hi all,
I'm new to the list and am asking this question on behalf of Kevin, who has been using Just Intonation for years and loves the sound of it.

Is it possible to set up Just Intonation in the MIDI section of Logic Audio Discovery Version 3.0?

Regards,
Rikta
