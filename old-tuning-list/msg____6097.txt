i use kyma to send a bulk tuning dump to the ensoniq mr rack.  does anybody
know the tuning  resolution of the rack?  (are you out there, steve curtain?)
 it sounds pretty darn good, especially for music consisting of relatively fast
events (like, techno).

i don't like using pitch bend...the pitch bend affects all notes on that
channel, meaning that you can really only do monophonic stuff.  yuck.

the ensoniq is really smart about its tuning stuff.  for example, octave
transposition really doubles the frequency.  it does NOT simply add 12 to the
note number.  you can have any arbitrary ordering of pitches (they don't have
to be increasing).  the rack chooses the appropriate sample based on frequency,
not on notenumber.  you'd be amazed how many synths claim to support alternate
tunings, but yet do not provide these little details.
