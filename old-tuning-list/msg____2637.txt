Subject: Micro tuning, MIDI and Pitch Bend

From: thierry.rochebois@ief-paris-sud.fr (Thierry Rochebois)

For a few days, I attempt to achieve microtuning using
an Atari and a D5.

I use the pitch bend to affect the pitch.

The problem is that when a note is off... it is not really off:
the release of the note is not actually finished.

The solution consists in using half MIDI channels.
For each "virtual" channel, I will use 2 real channels so that
release part and pitch bend wouldn't overlap (I will play half the
notes on one real and the other half on the other real channel).

So, I will only be able to use 4 channels rather than 8...

I think that it will be enough for a start!
