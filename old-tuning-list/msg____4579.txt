From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

The problem for some with microtonal improvisation is it is near
impossible to analyze intonationally.  The music may be great, or even
superior to much of prepared composition, but it is tough for a
microtonalist to promote its microtonal pedigree.

Improvisation was once part and parcel of the Western art tradition in
music but increasingly lost favor in the late Baroque until its virtual
extinction.  J.S. Bach stands apart from his contemporaries in the extra
detail he included in the scores...this from a master improvisor.

The reasons for the demise of improvisation is that composers began to
distrust players who would not stay within both the style and manner of
each particular piece.  I have heard several computer composers 
wax poetic at the inability of players to reproduce their music exactly
enough.  This is an extreme position.  And they were not speaking
exclusively of microtonal compositions.

Choosing notes from a given scale (albeit a microtonal scale) is easier to
do, I think, than imagining exact microtonal relationships and producing
them extemporaneously.  Matter of fact, many "classical" composer do not
realize the exactitude with which a player can pluck (as described by the
great shenai player Bismallah Khan) any of an infinte number of microtones
out of the sky.

Interestingly, south India is much more of a composition-based society,
while in north India the music is mostly improvised.  Both use the
microtones of Raga, however their choice of instruments is different.
Clearly, both north and south Indian music has immense power and value as
music. Microtonal improv, however, lacks easy musical analysis for pitch.
This factor alone may account for its lack of supporters among the
microtonally literate.
