Subject: Microtonal font

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Brian McLaren mentioned my microtonal font, and Adam Silverman asked about
it. One of the unpleasant facts of academic life (pace Brian) is that I 
have to work more and harder this year just to keep going, which is I 
imagine true of everyone in nearly any profession. Accordingly, there is 
some tweaking I have to do to this font to be able to present it to 
others which I have been unable to complete since originally mentioning 
the font in this forum some months ago.

Forgive the delay please; it will come, and it will be 1995.

I have not actually used the font with Finale yet, but there's no reason why 
it shouldn't work. It is simply a font (bit-mapped, Postscript, TrueType, 
etc.). It contains 123 symbols, which should keep many people happy or 
busy or both. More description later if anyone wants it.

Although I do not want to use this list to sell something, I will offer
the straight facts and not attempt to advertise it. If readers object, I
will not mention the font again on the list except to say it is available,
and then give more information to readers privately. The information will
probably end up on the list anyhow... 

It is in a Macintosh format only, by the way. Also, I have not figured 
out Finale's arcane goings on as have Brian and others. I have used the 
font until now with Lime, because I can simply declare a pitch offset for 
each accidental and have my synthesizer produce the correct pitch on 
playback. This happens regardless of how many accidentals sit in front of 
a note. The limit is currently 14, I think. But that's to Lime's credit, 
not mine. Lime has some limits, as Brian mentioned; but using pitch bend 
it enables many synthesizers to do what I described, (not using pitch 
bend for the old FB-01). Pitch bend is not ideal, but it works for now.
