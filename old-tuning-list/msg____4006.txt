Subject: A Problematic BM

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Brian.  He's kidding, isn't he?  This can't be real, can it??

Well, enough have weighed in.  Many have been quick and merciful in pointing
out the obvious.  As for me, I figure anyone who pans any life system as big
as the WWW (not to mention the entire net) after only four hours of
amateurish searching must need a wheelbarrow to transport their gonads.

So Brian says:
>[B] somebody named Harry Partch did something in connection with
>microtonality, but he's obviously not worth bothering with because no
>info is available about him

Not to mention the British Harry Partch Society web site (which has a page
of microtonal resources), it makes me wonder what brought the visitors to
Corporeal Meadows for the last 10 weeks - dumb luck?  No, the keywords <META
NAME="keywords"> for the gateway page are (in order):

   Partch corporeal just intonation microtonal

and this site has been submitted to as many submittal places and search
engines as I can find.  Of course some take a while to add to their indices,
but I can't help that.  I'll be here for a while and meantime, something is
obviously working.  Brian is obviously not.  

He slams all but Manuel for not including [...many things...], and lo and
behold, some of those 'things' are right there on the Meadows; kind of
insulting.  Finally, since designing the site is *not* an occupation, but a
service I am providing out of the goodness of my heart (and pocketbook),
well, you'll see...

But I smile when I see:
>    If you have a web site or ftp site for microtonal music, please 
>add it to the Virtual Library at 
>http://www.w3.org/pub/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html

John Starrett showing just how to get things happening, in three little
lines.  Wonderful contribution!  I agree when John says:

>Finally, I like Brian (never met him). I like passionate people.  They are 
>interesting, but sometimes a pain in the ass. When one of them  explodes 
>all over his friends, neighbors and enemies alike, one expects  that is 
>for a good reason, and one expects changes will then occur.  Since Brian 
>has thrown down the gauntlet in his own court, and with such  force, I 
>expect nothing short of perfection, and soon. 

With that in mind, and the following:

>Brian McLaren will be in the San Diego area for the next several months...

I just can't pass up and opportunity like this.  Please note that the Sonic
Arts Gallery is not just in my neck of the woods, but mere *blocks* from my
house, I haven't seen Jonathan Glasier in a long time (overdue), and I am
feeling frisky.  I'm not gigging on Dec. 7th, so I hope to make it to the
concert.

Yes, I am going to meet Brian McLaren, and find out what's up.  To
paraphrase David Brinkley, I may not be able to be objective but I can try
to be fair.  I'll be sure and let you know exactly when the Brian McLaren
Home Page / Microtonality Central is on the WWW; I can post my *own* email <g>.

Am I nuts or what?  Must be the single malt talking...

Cheers,
Jon
