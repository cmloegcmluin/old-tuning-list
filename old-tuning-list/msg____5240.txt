I agree, and then some. In this book, Tame takes an overall tone of
European racial superiority. His objections to jazz reflect a general
objection to any strongly rhythmic music -- to all of the musical forms
of Africa and the Middle East, for example. He also objects to any music
that constitutes a meeting of different musical genres. I believe his
phrase was "grotesque -- as all half-breeds are grotesque." These
objections were explicit; however, I don't have the book anymore and
can't offer exact quotes. I got rid of it because I found it overtly
racist and offensive, and not particularly well-written.

Far better books on this subject are:

Berendt, Joachim-Ernst, _The World is Sound: Nada Brahma, Music and the
Landscapes of Consciousness (Rochester, VT: Destiny, 1983)
Campbell, Don, ed., _Music: Physician for Times to Come_ (Wheaton, IL:
Quest/Theosophical Publishing Co., 1991)
Gardner, Kay, _Sounding the Inner Landscape: Music as Medicine
(Stonington, ME: Caduceus, 1990)
Hamel, Peter Michael, _Through Music to the Self_ (Boulder, CO:
Shambhala, 1976)
Goldman, Jonathan, _Healing Sounds: The Power of Harmonics_ (Rockport,
MA: Element, 1992)
