Subject: RE: octave equivalence

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

You know, I've been pondering Bill Sethares' mention of a study "that
approached octave-equivalence from a melodic perspective" (that's probably not a
direct quote, but that was the idea).  

   I don't know whether what I'm about to say will be perceived as...
* a pointless statement of an obvious truism,
* a surprising but insightful observation, or
* utterly preposterous nonsense,
but something dawned on me after I read that statement from Bill:  As far as I
can tell, octave equivalence is ONLY meaningful from a melodic perspective.
That because the entire purpose of fusing individual tones into a chord is to
have them lose their individual identities and form a single combined sound.  

   Now that is not to suggest that two notes an octave apart have to be played
in sequence rather than together, for them to be appreciated as octave
equivalents.  But if they are played simultaneously, you have to at least
auditorially pick the pitch of one tone out of the chord, then the other, then
compare the two.  If you were not to do that, then they would be no more than
simply a combination timbre like from an organ, rather than tones that sound
like two versions of the same pitch.
