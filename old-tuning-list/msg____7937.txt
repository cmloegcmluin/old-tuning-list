   Johnny Reinhard of course gets plenty of unusual tunings from his
bassoon and other instruments, by using nontraditional fingerings on
traditional instruments.  I was pleased to see, however, that a very
reputable flute maker was marketing an instrument specifically designed,
including keys that don't exist on the traditional instrument - to play
quartertones.
