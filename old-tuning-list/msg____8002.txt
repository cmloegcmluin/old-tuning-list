A few items...again, in regard to the Buzz system...it's the 12 tone 
eq system which is screwed; until they fix that, it doesn't matter what 
you do to the intonation. It is indeed frustrating that this is pased off 
to many musicians as a real breakthrough...
    There is an interesting article in the June 1998 issue of Inside Kung 
Fu about the use of sound in the Hung Ga system...they associate the 5 
tones of Chinese music with other Chinese philosophies, and relate them 
to the practice of their martial art...
    For anyone in the Denver/Boulder area, Junko Shigeta (koto) and I 
will be on radio station KGNU Monday, June 8, from 7-8 PM, on their 
Cabaret show. Junko is a marvelous musician, and very open minded. We are 
doing some traditional Japanese music, and some microtonal compositions 
too (19 and 34 eq). I am also starting to play my fretless acoustic on 
the traditional stuff, which will allow me to perfectly match her 
pitches, many of which are definitely not 12 eq...although a lot of them 
do match up pretty well. One interesting discovery for me was that in one 
of our pieces, her major 3rd is sharp even to the 12 eq 3rd; maybe it's 
Pythagorean? Does anyone know? (plus, it sounds right on her koto).I 
believe there is a fellow on line here who plays koto...your opinion 
would be welcome...Hstick
