Subject: 19

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

While there are undoubtedly many new ways to use 19 that are truly 
wonderful, some of which Brian McLaren has described, his assertion that 
traditional 12-note modes of thinking must be abandoned is contradicted 
by the aural evidence. In addition, to say that the intervals of 1/19 and 
2/19 do not sound like a semitone also seems contradicted by experience. I 
think it best to keep in mind that a "semitone," like all intervals, has 
a range of acceptability, depending on many factors; to compare the 
63-cent interval and 126-cent interval to 100 cents grounds the 
discussion too firmly to 12-note ET as a standard.

There are certainly problems using 1/19 and 2/19 as a semitone. Those 
very problems may also create solutions as well as lead to some other 
ways of using 19 which may have nothing to do with semitones at all.

Any other opinions out there?
