Subject: Cheap Explorations -- the Temporary Guitar

From: Steven Rezsutek <steve@synapse.gsfc.nasa.gov>

It was a busy weekend for me, but I now have a microtonal instrument
that is a bit less unwieldy than my keyboard.  I don't take ultimate
inspirational credit for this by any means, but I thought that others
would be interested in the success story.

I had de-fretted a cheapie classical guitar that I had some time ago,
with intent of fretting it to a xenharmonic scale, but hadn't decided
which one yet, and I never seemed to get around to placing that order
to Stew-Mac.  I tried tying frets, using old strings, but was never
able to get them to lie flat against the fingerboard.

Finally, this past Saturday, the desire to do some exploration
overcame the mental barrier about needing to have "real" frets, and a
quick trip to the shop produced a handfull of bits of fine 4130
welding wire (not that it matters, but 4130 is a rather musical steel,
IMO, at least judging by the bicycle part wind chimes I build a few
years ago).

A couple of hours later, I had cemented down, trimmed, and filed 31
pieces of wire, fretting the guitar to 22TET, more or less. Dipping
the wire into the tube of cement (Duco Cement) provided enough
adhesive to hold the fret to the board, even after it had been slid
around to fine tune, without making the appearance too unsightly. I
had cut the wires long to provide ease of handling, and then snipped
off the "handle" when the cement had hardened.

The acutal tuning was done by ear, using my synth as a guide, and
tuning by unisons and octaves on the first and fifth string
(`A'10).  Not exactly precision, but it seems good enough for my
purposes at the moment, and it actually had a sort of "warm, earthy"
feel in its imperfection.

By all appearances, this operation can be done numerous times without
harming the structural integrity of the instrument and without a slew
of specialized tools.  The downside is that its accuracy may leave
something to be desired (wires not perfectly straight, or not
perfectly set, varying intonation, etc.).

I call it "temporary" for a couple of reasons:

The first is that the wires can be removed with a little acetone, and
the finger board sanded if necessary, and recemented down in a
different tuning.  I had sealed the fingerboard with Minwax wood
hardener (or something) when I made it fretless, which seems to both
provide a good bond with the cement, and prevent it from soaking into
the wood too far.

The second is that the whole affair seems rather delicate, so I don't
expect it to last all that long before it needs attention.  As long as
it survives long enough for me to decide whether its tuning-du-jour is
worth preserving in a "permanent" fingerboard, though, it will have
served its purpose.


Now, the fun part begins... :-)


BTW, the inspiration came from something I recall reading long ago
about the frets of the <mumble> being adjusted and then fixed with
wax.  [If anyone knows what instrument that is, could you refresh my
memory?  I want to say sitar, but I don't think that's correct]


Hoping someone finds value in this,

Steve
