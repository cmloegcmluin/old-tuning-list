Subject: Catler and such

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

First of all, to respond to James Jeude's post about the Forever Bad Blues
Band gig...I couldn't agree more about James's assessment of Catler vs.
McLaughlin...I too believe that McLaughlin's innovative days are behind
him, although he is one of the best guitarists to ever play the instrument.
Catler is certainly in the forefront of innovation in the guitar world
today, and I would certainly like to see him get the recognition he
deserves. In fact, I wrote a profile on Catler and Dan Stearns in the
May 1996 issue of GUITAR PLAYER mag...see if you can pick it up, or, I
would be happy to send a copy of the article to anyone who requests it.

To contact Catler, try 2350 Broadway #240, New York NY, 10024, or call
212-580-0602 (not in the mornings). As far as his unequally fretted
axe, it is a 49 note/oct. 13 limit JI design (of Catler's), but I
would not presume to comment too authoritatively on it. Please contact
Jon, and I believe you'll find him more than helpful to talk to (one
of my 12 year old students called him to interview him for a term paper,
and he was very kind with his time). And yes, we are indeed bringing
the Catler Bros. to Denver on October 19th for MICROSTOCK II...more
info on this gig later.

One last comment...there has been a good discussion of Partch's music
lately, and I want to clear up my position a tad...Partch's tuning
is not "weird" to me, and the scale itself is not the issue. For me,
it is the emotional/spiritual content that I do not care for; I just
don't like whatever he was expressing...that is a totally personal and
subjective opinion, and in no way is meant to challenge his genius.
It is not a matter, for me, of "getting used to it"...Hstick
