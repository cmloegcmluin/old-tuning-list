Subject: Cage pointer (haven't I mentioned this before?)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

In light of the recent couple of posts on the late Mr. Cage, I just thought
I'd mention again that I've found James Pritchett's book "The Music of
John Cage" [Cambridge University Press] to be one of thos volumes that
has actually gone a long way toward providing light rather than heat on
the subject of Mr. Cage's music [since that's what it's about. Scores and
everthang....] *and* its aesthetic and historical contexts. It's quite a
short read, and - at the very least - the explication of the overall
architecture of Cage's early percussion works is worth the price of
admission alone. I think it should provide you with a good idea of the
range of Cage's compositional output over the course of his career, as
well. I'd sure like to see a volume of as high a quality on Mr. Partch....

An interesting aside: he alludes to it a bit in the introduction to the
book, but James *certainly* didn't start his musical career as a
fan of Cage's work - if anything, quite the reverse. What changed his
view was a serious look at the work itself, and the experience of meeting
and getting to know Cage. I think that at least some of the insight gained
helps to make this an interesting book, and I commend it to your
attention.

With regards,
Gregory

paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
