J.S. Bach's reputation was to empower the cello as opposed to fretted
gamba continuo useage.  This is besides the special and historic attention
Bach gave the cello in the 6 Suites for Cello.

While learning of Bach's championing of the fretless cello, with his
gunning apart from the status quo, I concluded it must have something to
do with the ease with which the cello could perfrom in the myriad of
well-temperament constellations.

Gallileo's father Vincenzo Gallilei's musical sponsor Bardi
described how due to temperament, lute players (of whom Vincenzo was an
arch-lute virtuoso) did not play with keyboard players because the
sound was painful.  (Read Bardi in Strunk, The Renaissance in Source
Material).  Keyboards kept different friends than lutes, apparently.

To hear some strinking lute temperament, with a choice of possible C's and
other notes, listen to Irish-born composer John Dowland played in the
tuning insisted upon by his son, lutenist Robert.  Wim  Hoogewerf of Paris
played Renaissance-era Dowland exquisitely on a microtonally-designed
guitar (each string had individual fretlets).  Hearing Dowland performed
in this added dimension is the proper preparation for Bach in Werckmeister
III.
