I had to work out my own feelings on this subject, and came to some sort 
of resolution.  HP's moods came from much deeper than the harmonies, but 
must have had some sort of grave extramusical bitterness involved 
(Extrabitter Music?  Bitter Extramusic?).  Actually, the person who 
helped me deal with this the best was Dean Drummond, who hasn't been 
given much credit around here for being the closest to HP's music, be it 
on HC, string quartet or zoomoozophone.  He pointed out that the 
crassness is a built-in factor, and is not meant to be attractive.  While 
Harry's music is satirical to the LCD (see: "Exercises in Counterpoint 
Tried in a Court of Ancient Ritual", or the "Do Not Loiter" section of 
_Dreamer_), is must not be expected to lift the spirit like "Don't Worry, 
Be Happy".  None of it does, with the possible exception of the Lewis 
Carroll songs.  After abandoning the music for a while, I have come back 
to it full-force, with a love and respect for its similarity to "Four 
Saints In Three Acts"--unsubtle satire with tongue firmly in cheek.  My, 
don't I take myself too seriously sometimes.

Yours,
Adam

P.S.: Did anyone notice that "Don't Worry, Be Happy" is good 5-limit JI?  
Maybe Toby Twining should cover it:)
