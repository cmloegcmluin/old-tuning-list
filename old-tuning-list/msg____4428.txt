Subject: new www microtonal midi examples & software

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Kami sent me this URL

http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~moh/midifiles/
 
this morning. Here you will find numerous Persian music MIDI files and a 
command line program that runs on UNIX to retune existing MIDI files
by cents. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks easy and straight forward. 
Thanks, Kami.

I enjoyed the new age joke in yesterdays digest. I haven't really heard 
any microtonal jokes yet, but I imagine one must end in "...because he 
kept losing his temper! Haw haw haw". 

Adolph Mares, the president of the Denver musicians union did quip to me 
a few months ago, upon hearing that I was going to do a microtonal gig 
with Neil Haverstick, "So you're going to use those little sons of pitches?"
