Subject: lurkers confess ?

From: Joergen Teller <106321.1617@CompuServe.COM>

hello tuners

i've been reading this list on/off since a year.
as a composer my main interests in microtunings are related to
EPS-samplers, MIDI-guitar, drone-guitar, slide-guitar, feedback,
grainsamples, electro acoustics etc.

I used microtunings like 19,24, 31, 53 ET / JI and some homegrown
prime/series of growth-based ideas and frequencie relations based on ants'
communication and the boosted freq. area of the human ear.... also i use  a
lot of doubling of samples with detuning the original samples from 6-33
cents to make the sound live in the stereo etc etc.
 
these tunings were used on tape pieces and for works with MIDI-guitar and
sampler. the guitar were tuned diatonic and sometimes played with slide or
distortion using a heavy pickin' to create overtones and flageolets ...

so in that way i incorporate microtuning and just wait and see where this
change in my music will bring me and the listeners. 

the list here is great. i enjoy the information on different composers work
- especially the brief passage on spectral composition - i found 3 cd's
with Tristan Murail- which I only just have had time to listen to.

Some of the discussions is a bit beyound my knowledge to interact with
so i just lurk and delete a lot - well now you know i'm there behind the
screen somewhere -  i dont know at which frequency your pc is humming - but
here in cph we have 50 hz running in the wires so i guess my mac sings in
that area 

- sing along 

(thanx for the kickin'  J. Reinhard)

best
