Subject: Nicola Vicentino

From: TONY SALINAS <salinas@lgu.ac.uk>

Dear list members,

Apologies for assuming that Nicola Vicentino wrote a piece 
for 4 viols (31 tones/octave)

This is originally a 4 part madrigal, which is followed by infor-
mation on how to fret lutes and viols to his enharmonic 31 notes
octave tuning.... why??? .... probably with the idea of playing
the madrigal on a fix pitch instrument in order to train the
singers.

His archicembalo obviously, dindn't give a sustained tone, but
I think he built a portative organ (31 tones/octave) which
would probably give better idea to the singers of the sound
of the madrigal. Anyway, I think this portative organ didn't
have enough range to play the madrigal.

Going to the point...Nicola Vicentino didn't seem to state
very clear if he meant a 31tone 1/4-comma meantone tuning
or a 31 ET, which in fact doesn't make much difference.
Since the use of logaritmic calculation wasn't discovered
until XVII century, I presume that he thought of meantone
as sounding equal tempered.
