Er, pardon me but it _is_ correct; at least, it is cribbed directly from
the code that generated the table at
<http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist.txt>, and I haven't
discovered any errors in that table yet.  (And that table _doesn't_
claim that all tunings are level 1 consistent.  Code it up and run it
yourself if you don't believe me.)  Don't be misled by the natural
language paraphrase that I followed it with--the paraphrase is not
exact, but I couldn't think of a concise and non-technical way to say it
precisely.

Holy cow, it was just an example.  The point is that such discrepancies
will occur in any tuning that is level 1 but not level 2 consistent, as
you demonstrated with 22TET.

That's absolutely fine with me.  More than fine, it's great.  Odd
structural artifacts like this in low-consistency tunings are features
of, for example, several of Easley Blackwood's 12 Microtonal Etudes, and
massively cool pieces I think they are.  It's just a different path than
that which I am attempting to follow.

Please understand that I am not trying to talk you out of composing in
22TET or whatever tuning you please; I am simple trying to explain that
my preference for higher consistency is _not_ "arbitrary", but justified
given certain assumptions which you may not share.  I respect your
compositional choices; please do me the same courtesy.
