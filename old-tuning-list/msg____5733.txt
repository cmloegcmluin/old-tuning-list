Actually, the most common mistake (Part 1) is to try to put some word
like "unsubscribe" in the subject, (the second option, above).  This is
rejected by the listprocessor to avoid mail loops (which is necessary -
think it through if you must).  The most common mistake (Part 2) is to
then ignore the very clear "suspicious subject" message that the
listprocessor sends back and to continue to assume that you are sending
the wrong message to the wrong address or something.  I don't know how
many times my mailbox has been muddled with people simply ignoring the
"suspicious subject" message and trying various addresses and messages
and then finally sending me some possibly rude message about how
nothing works.
