Books that do an excellent job with both history and at least one
composer's original ideas are:

1. _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_ by Easley Blackwood
(don't have the citation handy).

2. _Genesis of a Music_ by Harry Partch. Da Capo Press, New York, 1974.

3. _New Music with 31 notes_ by A. D. Fokker. Verlag fur systematiche
Musikwissenschaft GmbH, Bonn, 1975.

Start with these and then I can give you references for specific
theories.
