Subject: modes (last gasp)

From: "Collins, Gordon" <CollinG@f3groups3.fsd.jhuapl.edu>

>These are the proverbial "church modes" used in Gregorian chant [....]

An adequate description of the church modes is beyond the scope of a 
reasonable post, but, just for the record, the primary distinguishing 
characteristics of the original church modes are as follows (numbered and 
named as by the medieval writers):

                    Final    Nominal    Nominal
                              lower      upper
                             bound of   bound of
                             melody     melody

 1)  Dorian           D         D          d
 2)  Hypodorian       D         A          a
 3)  Phrygian         E         E          e
 4)  Hypophrygian     E         B          b
 5)  Lydian           F         F          f
 6)  Hypolydian       F         C          c
 7)  Mixolydian       G         G          g
 8)  Hypomixolydian   G         D          d

(The note names refer to the double octave A-G,a-g,aa of available notes - 
tuned in 3-limit JI - then in use.)

In the 16th century, Glarean added four more:

 9)  Aeolian          A         A          a
10)  Hypoaeolian      A         E          e
11)  Ionian           C         C          c
12)  Hypoionian       C         G          g


This would all be much simpler if whoever first threw away everything but the 
note range, redefined *that* as a "white note scale", ignored half the modes, 
and added the "Locrian" scale had chosen a new term for his/her creation....
