Which I can confirm. I picked up an Egyptian Oud recently that uses  
mother-of-pearl and laquer (sp?) on the fingerboard, and different from  
the lute, is performed with a plectrum (traditionally an Eagles feather)  
to double-pick in a very impulsive fashion. With the right tension  
strings, you get a very clear tone without buzz because of the amount of  
energy imparted into the string. You do need to be "fretting" on the  
very tip of the finger, I must try the sarangi fingernail stopping.  
Interestingly, there is not a saddle like in a guitar.

I bought it because I liked the sound and felt it would aid playing  
alternative tunings, without having to build or commission a special  
guitar, resetting sliding frets etc, and could draw on lutherie  
experience of a traditionally fretless, plucked instrument. I hope over  
time it will aid training my intonational sense.

I was interested to read the Oud in the past has used frets, does  
someone have a reference or examples? Other Levant instruments like the  
Saz and Tar use tied on frets, which of course the Lute has used, the  
Bouzouki and I believe it's arabic cousin, the Buzuk, use hammered in  
frets.
