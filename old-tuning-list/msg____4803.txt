Subject: Diapason Press

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

Some readers will be aware that some years ago, Dr. Rudolf Rasch of the
University of Utrecht started Diapason Press to publish three kinds of
material: 

a tuning and temperament library, consisting of treatises dealing with
microtonal matters, often with translations and always with extensive
commentary. 

a general series of music, consisting of works historically significant to
the history of tuning, even though not always microtonal in an explicit
sense. 

Corpus microtonale, a series of microtonal compositions, mostly from this 
century.

I subscribed to all three series and am glad I did because of their high
quality. However, Rudolf has been busy with other things in recent years
and hasn't issued much material, also due to some expenses involved. 

The good news is that he will soon resume publication, probably within the
next year in all three series. I have been his assistant editor since
1988: that is my chief connection with Diapason Press. I encourage list
members to become acquainted with the series, perhaps by visiting a
library which has some (I know, this is impossible for many people), and
supporting them with purchases, either directly or indirectly via a
library. There is truly valuable material available here. 

Because there is no web site for Diapason yet (one is planned), I will
list what's been published if enough people are interested. (But I have
only a week to do this, because I will be going away for a bit.) Further
information on prices, etc., could come later from various sources.
American and other foreign distribution is planned. 

The more material Rudolf sells, the more he can print. Meanwhile, rest 
assured that I receive no monetary benefit from any of this. The only 
"benefit" to me is more work, which in this cause I will gladly take on 
when I can.

I spent a pleasant few days with Rudolf two weeks ago in which he
explained his plans to me. I think they are very much worth supporting.
Any opinions out there?
