Subject: a plea to Partch disciples

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Many folks have shown their heads recently, describing themselves as 
"Partch experts" as far as having played in his ensembles etc.  Why is it 
that whenever I have a question about his instruments, nobody responds to 
my queries?

Here is my newest question: in Intrusion 3 (The Rose), Adapted Guitar II 
has ratios *only above* the tablature to mark stopping by the sliding 
bar.  In the next Intrusion (The Crane), ratios are found above, plus 
parenthetical ratios are below the notes. I am especially having trouble 
figuring out which octave is being used, as he was lax in "boxing" the 
ratios to represent the upper 2/1.

Can someone who has played the Adapted Guitar II answer these questions?
