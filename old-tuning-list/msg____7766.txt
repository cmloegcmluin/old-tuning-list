This doesn't mean all that much--I'm still struggling with the 7-limit,
but if I were to work in 9-limit or higher, I'd probably prefer to
diagram the 9s with a separate axis, and have one of the unison vectors
be (2 0 0 -1), to reflect my odd-limit orientation.  Of course this
would be much easier if I were a five-dimensional being who could buy
4-dimensional graph paper.
