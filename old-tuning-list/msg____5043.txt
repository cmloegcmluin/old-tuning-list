RE ether: Whether Einstein or other theorists still needed the
concept of the ether in 1920 is irrelevant to physics today.
The concept is not needed for current theories. Einstein never
accepted quantum mechanics in full and ignored the strong and
weak nuclear forces in formulating his abortive unified field 
theory. He made essentially no contribution to physics after General 
Relativity. 

Re Rydberg states of H: Spectra of atoms more complex than hydrogen do
not have these simple relations. However, other number series than
n^2 (n 1, 2, 3 etc.) may be used for defining chords, scales
and intervals. Fokker made use of the Fibonacci and Lucas series. 
Brian McLaren has proposed a number of other series. Erv Wilson has 
generated many too.

Dominant 7th: While one might add the 8 to the 4:5:6:7, it is not
mandatory and makes the chord unnecessarily dense. One might add
the 9 to make a dom major 9th or 17 (8:10:12:14:17 as a minor 9th.
The 10:12:14:17 part is Ellis's diminished 7th. Other chords such
as 11:13:15:17 have been used too.

Re Aristoxenos: I think Jonathan's suggestion that reluctance to
extract the 5th root of 4/3 explains the failure of Greek theorists
to interpret Aristo correctly is a wonderful piece of insight. 
I too was seduced by the octave...

Paul E: I have constructed a number of positive systems with good
Harmonic 7ths.  Will post a few later when I have formatted them.
