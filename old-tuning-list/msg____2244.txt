Sorry I didn't take the time to read that in detail.  I appreciate your

I can't... but as I said, I was puzzled that K's temperaments didn't live 
up to his own description of JSB's.  However, my explanation was that by 
K's time taste was shifting towards the classical style, for which K's 
temperaments might really be better suited.

Organbuilder John Brombaugh, located here in Eugene, OR, now uses Kellner 
regularly (except for the occasional meantone organ with subsemitonia!).  
Bach's music is a first priority in his organ designs.  He started using 
Werckmeister, then Kirnberger, then a modified version of same, use 1/6 
comma Valotti in at least one organ (Ames, Iowa), but has now settled on 
Kellner.  His organ at Eugene's Central Lutheran church is now in 
Kellner, previously being in Kirnberger III then a modified Kirnberger.

My house organ was last tuned in Kellner, and I found it quite
satisfactory.  I'm considering one of Neidhardt's, though.  I asked
Brombaugh's opinion of N's temperaments, and he called them "monkey
business."
