Subject: Ed Foote's ET remarks

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

Back in the 70's the elder Mr. Sabathil and Robert Buecker
both lent me harpsichords for a while, and naturally I had
to tune them every couple of days.

For me, at least, well temperaments are what comes naturally in
this situation. Each time I tuned, I tried to find appropriate
little personalities for each key. E and A were usually brilliant,
and G and E-flat were usually sweet; but it was a game pursued
for fun, and it was different every time.

I think it is simply true that the well temperaments are
attractive variations on ET, and they are indeed improvements
upon ET.

The French, of course, are bureaucrats by nature; but in practice
a well temperament is better even for serialism than a blank
ET. It is true that one might want to retune keyboards in serial
pieces from section to section, or even phrase to phrase, but
that is no insurmountable problem with electronic instruments.

Best,

Will
