Subject: a little stretch

From: wabi@server.net4you.co.at (Helmut Wabnig)

Hallo, 
Adam asked about stretch.
That is, lowering lows and heightening heights.

                                x
                            x
                       x
-----------x---x---x------------------>88 keys
      x
  x              piano tones
x


Three reasons:
1.)psychophysical
   there is a thread running on this list, 
   will they talk about?
   we tend to hear bass tones higher than they are
   physically and the opposite happens with high tones.
   Stretch compensates for that.
2.)Physical
   The upper partials in the higher notes are sharper
   withe respect to the notes and would give
   undesired beats.

This is called "Railsback" stretch after O.L. Railsback.

3.)The instrument sound becomes more aggressive, brighter.
   Use it for a piano in a crowded and noisy bar.
   Other instruments like it too, eg accordeons, harmonicas.
   Too much stretch will sound dissonant.

What will you do with too much hot water?
Store it in the deep freeze.
