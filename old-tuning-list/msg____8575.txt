   I probably didn't follow Bram's suggestion then.  In the case of Bill's
example, Bram, were you suggesting to add a wave at 100.5Hz whose amplitude
is a constant minus the amplitude of the composite waveform?  If so, then
as Bill said, yes, it seems like that ought to work.  It would seem pretty
involved when you get into nonsinusoidal waveforms, though.

   I was thinking, apparently incorrectly, that (again using Bill's
example) you expected to be able to remove the beating phenomenon by adding
a 1Hz sinewave to the 100Hz & 101Hz composite wave.  That didn't seem
likely to work auditorially, and certainly doesn't mean anything in terms
of the objective tones.
