You're welcome.  I should dig out my program and run it a little ways
past 1200, just to make sure there isn't some awesome ET out there that
would get us a lot more accuracy/consistency for not too much more
resolution.  For example, I found this line in my consist2.txt table:

1848|  46   5  5  5  4  .  .

1848 has higher consistency at the 11-limit, where 612 stops, is also
consistent at the 13- and 15-limits, and is divisible by 12 to boot!
