   Frankly, I'm inclined to agree that San Diego would be a better venue.
I believe that there are more active Xenharmonicists there than LA,
although perhaps not by much.  But perhaps more importantly, I think that
San Diego would be a somewhat less intimidating place to hang out in.  It
has quite a bit less traffic gridlock, for one thing.

   On the other hand, I'm just a Texan who has visited both places only a
few times, so I may not know what I'm talking about.
