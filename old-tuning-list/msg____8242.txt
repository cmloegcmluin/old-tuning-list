Subject: Sound Forge

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

In an attempt to create JI instruments, I have begun putting the
individual
samples in my Emu E4K into Sound Forge, retuning them, and returning them
to the sampler.  However, I have not found any of the pitch shift/preserve
duration algorithms to be effective in retuning.  They all produce
obvbious chorusing effects on any but the smallest retunings.
I will say, though, that I have not put a whole bunch of time into this
endeavor.  Are there any Sound Forge users on this list that have found
any of the pitch shift algorithms to be particularly effective?

I have also tried to do pitch shifts without preserving the length of a
sample.  This technique is more effective, but changes the character of
some samples.

thanks 
Jesse
