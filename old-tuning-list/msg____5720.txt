You forget that equal temperament is also a well temperament.
A tuning is a well temperament when there is no wolf fifth and it can
be played in all keys. One precise definition is that there may be no
fifths larger than pure and no major thirds smaller than pure.
Your presumption does not hold for well temperaments. So, I don't know 
of any recordings of Das Wohltemperierte Klavier which are not in a
well temperament! On the other hand I neither know records which have
the tuning specified on the cover, but haven't made a real investigation.
There have been interesting discussings on the list before about which 
tuning Bach would have had in mind. You might want to read those. It
started in Sept. 1995. The old digests can be downloaded from the Mills
server. 
I don't have an answer for your 2nd question.

There is plenty of information. If you search for the string "temper" 
in the tuning bibliography then you get a match for most languages 
that you can narrow down.
