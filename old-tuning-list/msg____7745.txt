Subject: Washburn tuning improvement?

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

I saw a Washburn ad in a recent issue of Guitar PLayer that claimed they
used a new method of construction that enables you to play "in tune"
anywhere on the fretboard, but it gave no details.  Does anyone know what
this improvement is?
