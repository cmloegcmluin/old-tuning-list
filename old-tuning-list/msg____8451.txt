Subject: a cool bach site

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	This is not strictly tuning related, but this site has some 
amazingly deft MIDI reworkings of Bach in rock style, which are made to be 
heard with the Yamaha softsynth.  
	Also, on the business of Yamaha patenting 19TET instruments, is 
this a sign that they think this fad may catch on?
