Subject: Sine Mod ET's

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

The Tuning List has been rather inactive recently so I 
thought I'd post some recent studies of mine. Just before last Xmas, 
Brian Thomson posted some examples of sine-modulated equal temperaments. 
SMET's are ETs in which the interval width is periodically varied to 
improve the consonance of certain intervals, at least in the mode 
starting on the note 0. Brian used the formula A*sin(pi*F*N/ET) where F is 
the frequency (restricted to even numbers in this case), A is the 
amplitude, N is the note index and ET is the number of notes per octave). 
The phase is 0 at tone #0.
	I wrote a simple 1-D search program BASIC program and minimized 
the sum of the abolute values of the errors between the closest SMET 
notes and the JI intervals 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5, 5/3 and  8/5, a somewhat
 different set than BT used. The summed absolute error, squared error, 
mean deviation, variance  and standard deviations were computed in cents 
for each SMET. Other evaluation and statistical functions could have beed 
used, but these seemed appropriate to me.
	Results were obtained for the 12,15,17,19, 22, 24, and 31-tets. 
The errors of some unmodulated ET's are small enough that "improvement" 
is scarcely necessary and others are so inharmonic there is little point 
as even drastic amounts of modulation do not really make much difference. 
 
ET		F		A		STD 	Un-MOD STD
 
12		10		 0.132579	5.29859	12.05267	
 
15		8		-0.240234 	4.69927	13.31584	
 
17		10		 0.502893	5.53674	27.30851
 
19		8		 0.1136078	0.48389	5.95502
 
22		20		 0.1699097	2.94625	8.92950 
 
24		10		 0.265158	5.29859	12.05267
		
31		18		 0.133739	1.467844 4.58336 
 
A few caveats: the search program was somewhat sensitive to initial
conditions and although I set the acceptable summed error to be less 
than 10 exp -7, even in double precision mode, I would not trust the
numbers past the 6th figure. In a few cases, the best solutions had
A's greater than 0.5, which would imply overlapping notes, except
that in some cases two or 3 adjacent intervals varied sufficiently that
no inconsistencies arose. These cases have been omitted from the table
above except for 17. My solution for 19 is very similar to Brian's, the 
differences in the amplitude are probably due to my use of a different 
interval set and round-off in my computer.
