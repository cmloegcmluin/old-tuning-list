Steiner claimed to gain his knowledge directly from the "Akashic Record"
-- i.e., to have direct knowledge of cosmic truth. Statements such as
the one about Atlantis are basically equivalent to and as historically
precise as contemporary "channelled communications." Steiner's roots
were in the Theosophical movement of the 19th century; he eventually
broke from the Theosophists to form his own school, Anthroposophy, a
pastiche of Christianity, Northern European pre-Christian traditions,
Goethean science, Zoroastrianism, and eastern esotericism.

The motif of intervals and the octave as emblems of human experience are
discussed in _In Search of the Miraculous_, by P.D. Ouspensky, and
_Enneagram Studies_, by J.G. Bennett. While these writings are
subsequent to Steiner's, they also derive from late nineteenth century
esotericism, and from individuals who were as mysterious as Steiner
regarding the sources of their information. Though I am not familiar
with her writings, Helena Blavatsky's writings might be an interesting
source to mine for more background.

Kay Gardner discusses the psychological effects the various intervals in
Sounding the Inner Landscape.
