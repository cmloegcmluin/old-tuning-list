Subject: 88CET #10:  Note Doubling

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Probably the easiest way in a traditional tuning to extend a chord is by
doubling one or more notes in octaves from its basic position.  One of the main
goals of Sethares' 88CET-optimized partial mappings is to create a pseudo-octave
with a pitch-duplicating sensation kind of like the real octave's.  That 14-step
pseudo-octave works great for doubling on these mapped timbres.  On
approximately harmonic timbres however, this and the other false perfect
consonances don't work at all for doubling.  The rest of this posting addresses
doubling in reference to the usual unmapped timbres.  
 
   Can the octave-doubling principle be extended to tunings that don't even have
an octave, by doubling by an interval other than an octave?  Brian McLaren, who
has worked with a variety of nonoctave tunings, believes that whatever your
cycle-interval may be can produce a doubling effect.  He reports, for example,
that doubling notes in 3:1 perfect twelfths in Pierce-Bohlen tuning works just
great.  

   What exactly the cycle interval is in 88CET, or in Carlos' alpha and beta
tunings for that matter, is not immediately apparent.  The step size for these
tunings, unlike Pierce-Bohlen, are not based on making any particular interval
exactly just.  They are instead based upon making several target intervals as
accurate as possible.  

   To my way of thinking, for a tone added to a chord to be thought of as a
double, that tone should not have much effect on the underlying character of the
entire chord.  If it changes the character of the chord, then it clearly has a
significant function in the new chord, so it doesn't make sense to think of it
as a functionally equivalent double of a another chord tone.  

   The idea of nonoctave doubling then has meaning provided that: 
1.  The interval by which you double a note is more "bland" than the intervals 
    in the chord itself.  Consider for example the traditional 4:5:6 close-
    voiced, root-position, major triad.  Doubling the root an octave higher 
    does not significantly change the underlying character of the resultant 
    chord from its undoubled form.  The octave added into that chord is 
    comparatively bland; doesn't attract our ears' attention like the thirds.  
    On the other hand, if we were to instead to try to double its root a 7:4 
    ratio higher, the underlying character of the chord does significantly 
    change.  It becomes a dominant seventh chord.  The subminor seventh 
    attracts attention as much as the thirds in the chord, if not more.  
2.  No other resultant interval is more interesting than the intervals in the 
    undoubled chord.  Using the above example of doubling the root of 4:5:6 
    major triad up an octave, the resultant chord has the ratio 4:5:6:8.  That 
    clearly creates the interval of an octave between the root and its double 
    (4:8), but it also creates a perfect fourth (6:8), and a minor sixth (5:8).
    The underlying character of the chord does not change also because those 
    intervals are no more attention-getting than the major and minor thirds 
    already in the undoubled chord.  Obviously you would get a very different 
    sensation if you were to start with a 3:4:5 second-inversion triad, and 
    attempt to double the bass up a perfect fifth.  Although the interval of 
    doubling, the fifth, is bland in comparison with the other intervals in the
    original chord, this also produces a 9:8 major second, which is clearly 
    anything but bland, so it definitely attracts attention away from the 
    constituents of the original chord.  It changes the chord's underlying 
    character.
