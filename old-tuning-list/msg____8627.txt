The suggestions about making it more inclusive sound good to me.

And a conference in southern California sounds great.  One suggestion,
for international delegates it might be more convenient if the
conference took place in the summer.  It's difficult for me, for
example, to come to the States when I'm supposed to be teaching
over here.  That's a big reason why I don't get to most of the
microtonal festivals that go one for a day or two here and there.

Best,

Lydia Ayers
