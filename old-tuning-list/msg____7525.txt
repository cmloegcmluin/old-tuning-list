Subject: JI Tuning Resolution

   Another consideration that deserves some thought along these lines is
that very few acoustic instruments have their overtones within 1 cent of
exact harmonics.  So, if the ideal is to realize the natural sound of real
acoustic instruments, within 1/2 cent of exact JI ratios, then that might
end up somewhat like painting a bullseye with a spray can:  Your mark may
be centered right on the center of the target, but it might still cover a
quarter of the radius of the target.

   I am of course exaggerating to illustrate the point.  The mitigating
factor here is that most instruments have their lower partials closer to
harmonic than their higher ones, which are generally quieter.
