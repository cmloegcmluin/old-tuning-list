Subject: Overtones and Tone Color

From: <Nangaku@aol.com>

Thanks for all the response to my overtone/tone color question.  So does it
follow that ideally one takes into consideration the natural acoustic
properties of a particular instrument when one is choosing a particular tuning
system for an instrument?  Can anyone offer a good example where the complex
vibrations and shape of a particular instrument are highly integrated with the
system of tuning?
