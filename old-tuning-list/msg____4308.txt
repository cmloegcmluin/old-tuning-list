Subject: Re: McLaren on Group Theory, etc.

From: Gordon Collins <gcollins@ctisinc.com>

Dear me, dear me.  I've been lurking on this list for a few weeks,
waiting to get a feel for it, but I must rise up now in defense of
mathematics.  Yo, Brian!  Get yourself a good book on Number Theory.
Hardy & Wright is a good choice.  (Yes, that's *Number* Theory, not
*Group* Theory.  The integers modulo N do form a group under addition,
but that is not relevant to your post.  Issues of compositeness and
relative primality are pure Number Theory.)  In said book you will
discover that 7 mod 12 -5, not 5, and that yes-indeedy-do there are 12
(count 'em: 12 !) distinct equivalence classes modulo 12.

Faulty whole-number mathematics on the tuning list?  For shame!
