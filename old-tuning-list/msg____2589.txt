The question is perhaps better approached by rewording it: "...can 
perceive as a _pitch_?"

Remember that when we talk about "frequency" and "Hz" we are talking 
about the number of modulations from 0 air pressure to +/- n air 
pressure (amplitude) per second. You can _hear_ a 1 Hz tone; it is a 
transient followed, 1000 milliseconds later, by another transient (tap 
.. tap ... tap).

As you increase the frequency, you first hear these transients closer 
together (um, more "frequently" -- amazing language, ain't it?) until 
they start to sound more like a buzzing noise and, finally, a low hum (a 
pitch!) at around 20 Hz.

(I'm feeling really nostalgic remembering Bob Snyder demonstrating this 
to my first composition class, sticking a couple of cables into the e-Mu 
synth on the wall of the classroom and cranking the frequency up & down 
in the "threshold" zone. Everything I'm recycling here is derived from 
his course text (of course I never throw _anything_ away)).

This happens because our brain processes sensory data in "frames" 
approx. 30-50 ms long ... so discrete events which occur more frequently 
than 20x per second seem to happen continuously (we cannot perceive 
their absences between them). This is _exactly_ the same process by 
which we see film -- a collection of still images -- as a seamless 
moving image. The threshold below which we can detect flicker in a movie 
projector is approx. 16-18 frames per second (i.e., 16-18 Hz.). (16 and 
35mm cinema runs at 18 or 24 fps, (sound always at 24); but many super-8 
cameras and projectors run at 16 fps, a speed at which many people can 
see flicker; at progressively slower speeds, more and more people can 
resolve a succession of still images.)

(unfortunately, I can't find the _reader_ from that class, so I'm 
dependent on the familiarity of names in the bibliography in the text 
for suggestions ... you might try Lachman, Lachman & Butterfield, 
"Characteristics of the Short-Term Store" in _Cognitive Psychology and 
Information Processing_ (1979) (sorry, no editor listed here), Ernst 
Poppel, _Mindworks--Time and Conscious Experience_ 1988), um, I'd be 
guessing beyond that ... actually, I'm guessing *period* as to which 
article had which data, so *definitely* don't quote *me* (e-mail me a 
fax # & I'll send you the whole biblio))

Hope some of this helps...
