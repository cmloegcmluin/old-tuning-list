Patrick:  I like the idea on speaking to Roland.

Has there, in the past, ever been a "wish list"
sent around collectively?  Things like pitch
resolution, non-octave repeating scales, etc?

The two pieces I find usually missing are:
1) Only 12 pitches to choose (then next octave
        repeats)
2) Only ONE (or maybe 2, e.g. Yamaha) storable 
user scale, necessitating frequent trips to
a librarian application to get a new tuning.

Ideally, for me, one would have 5 or 6 tunings
quickley accessible, then these would also
be non octave-repeating. We could frame our request
as coming from the WM school, no?
