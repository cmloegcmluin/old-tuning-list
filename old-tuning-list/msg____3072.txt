Ladies and Gentlemen-
	Yes it is true that the dyes are photosensitive, and will degrade 
in direct sunlight, but with proper care they should last between 50 and 
100 years (according to manufacturer's accelerated aging tests). My 
brother (CDR expert) estimates more conservatively at about 10 years with 
the current media and sloppy handling. 
	There are a couple of good CDR drives going for $700 and the 
media price has dropped to $6 per disk. Within a couple of months 
Phillips, Sony and Yamaha drives will all be available for about $700 
(Bob says stay away from the JVC unit). CDR is not as permanent as CD 
with real pits and lands, but a disk with a 10 year lifetime is more than 
adequate for distribution to reviewers and radio stations as a promo 
tool. 
	Brother Bob is going to loan me a Pinnacle CDR unit so that I may 
learn to record CDR myself, and I will keep the forum updated on my 
progress in the nerdly art.
John Starrett
