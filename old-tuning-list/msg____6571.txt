Well said! Choosing a tuning system with that justification might make
sense in some algorithmic composition contexts but otherwise seems
poorly motivated.

Besides, Turkish musicians are trained in 53-tone and can readily
distinguish between, and perform in, scales where one member is
displaced by a comma (as often happens when comparing Turkish, Persian,
and Hindu scales).
