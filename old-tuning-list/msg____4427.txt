Cool. Thank you very much. I can get these to play now. I like it, especially the tuned 7ths.
There are some things I hear that I want to get in and see if I can try something else with,
but I'm now not sure how to edit the midi file. I'm using my new PC compatible and don't have
any midi editing software for it. All my midi stuff is on the Amiga, which is still packed
away in a box from moving. I notice some of the voicings have slow beats in them, which is 
probably due to the poor resolution of pitch bend on the Soundblaster card I have. I'm not
sure what the specifications are on this thing but I can hear that it's not perfect.

I haven't heard of that--would like to hear it and learn more about all the possible
instruments or tools out there which are available.

Sure. You can program your own voices starting with a pure sine wave and expanding from there
using frequency modulation of sine wave by sine waves, stacked. When I'm tuning the DX7-II, I
use a patch I made which is completely steady and has a brightness parameter that I can
adjust manually using the modulation wheel (the modulation wheel doesn't have to produce actual
modulation, or wobbling, it's a generic controller). I turn up the brightness to 
hear the upper partials, which makes it easier to tune pitches relative to one another by 
listening to the beats. The higher partials beat faster with small tuning deviations than the 
lower ones, so provide a better cue for fine tuning.

Before I had the DX7-II or the Amiga, I wrote a bunch of software for the Commodore 64 for
my own use. It has a SID (Sound Interface Device I think) chip which can play 3 notes at
the same time, each tunable to an exact partial in an humongous harmonic partial series
(overtone, not undertone like the frequency-divider type chips) from partial 1 to partial
65535. The frequency of the 1st partial was very low, like around .5 Hz or something. 
This thing could produce completely steady tones and play them in perfectly 
synced just intervals which would never beat in a million years. 

One of the software things I wrote was an ear training program. I wanted to be sure I
was one who could, as you wrote, DO it and not just talk about it. It quizzed me with
simple just ratios and as I got better increased the complexity of the intervals. It
also had a routine that would quiz me on random intervals (technically, they were just
ratios because that's all the SID chip could play, but the resolution was fine enough
that they can be considered approximations of any interval) for which it expected a 
value in cents to be answered. It would keep track of my errors in guessing and show 
me my average performance. On good days, I could identify random intervals with an 
average of 5 cents error.
