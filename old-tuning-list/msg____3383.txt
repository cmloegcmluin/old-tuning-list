Subject: octave equivalence

From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu>

Yesterday, when discussing experiments with the Bohlen-
Pierce scale, PAULE wrote: "octave equivalence is a real and 
unavoidable phenomenon."

"Octave equivalence" is one of those terms that we all think 
we know what it means, but when you get down to actually 
trying to define it, it becomes slippery. 

An intruiging experiment reported by D. Deutsch in the book 
"Psychology of Music" examined octave equivalence from a 
melodic, rather than a harmonic perspective. She took a 
familiar tune (maybe it was Yankee Doodle, but I'm not sure) 
and octave transposed a large number of the tones. When 
asked what the melody was, most people could not identify it. 
However, if the listeners were prompted (by hearing the 
unaltered melody just before) then they could 'hear out' the 
melody in the altered version.

One way to interpret this study is that this kind of octave 
equivalence is a function of "the brain" rather than of "the 
ear" (i.e., is a result of higher level neural processing rather 
than lower level sensorial processing). As such, it is likely that 
it is highly subject to training, or cultural conditioning.

The Bohlen-Pierce tritave unarguably exhibits one kind of 
"tritave equivalence" that is analogous to (one kind of) octave 
equivalence. This is: for a harmonic sound with partials at f, 
2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, 6f, ... and its octave with partials at 2f, 4f, 6f, 8f, 
.. playing the two together adds no new frequency 
information. Similarly, when a sound with only odd partials f, 
3f, 5f, 7f, 9f, ... and its tritave with partials at 3f, 9f, 12f, ... 
playing the two together adds no new frequency information. 
In fact, if you program up the scale, you can hear this kind of 
equivalence.

So, here are two kinds of "octave equivalence", neither of 
which is the kind meant by PAULE. 

Nonetheless, I know what PAULE means when he says "I 
found that 33 steps above the bass sounded like a resolution 
while 39 steps above the bass did not." Perhaps this is a 
result of our 12-tet octavocentric brainwashing (i.e., cultural 
conditioning).
