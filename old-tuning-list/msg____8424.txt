   The short version is that those who contributed recordings also
contributed money, and will get the CDs to sell, or whatever.  So,
concepually anyway, selling price and such will be up to the individual
contributors.

   Perhaps I'd only be guessing, but I suspect though that Neil will make a
suggestion for method of distribution and price and such, and most of the
contributors will follow that suggestion.

   To be honest though, I intend to donate a lot of my copies to university
and public audio libraries.
