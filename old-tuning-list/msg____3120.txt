The following excerpts from lectures and letters
by Edgard Varese, never published, appeared in
Soundings.  Ran across 'em the other day:
Varese foresaw electrical instruments which
promised
"Liberation from the arbitrary, paralyzing tempered
system: the possibility of obtaining any number of
subdivisions of the octave, consequently the formation
of any desired scale, unsuspected range in low and 
high registers, new harmonic splendors obtainable
from the now impossible use of subharmonic 
combinations..."
Sounds as though Varese would have been right at
home on this tuning forum.
In discussing "Integrales," Varese mentioned:
"While in our musical system we deal with
quantities whose values are fixed, in the
realization that I conceived the values would be
continually chaning in realtion to a constant.  In 
other words, this would be like a series of
variations, the changes resulting from slight
alterations of the form of a function or by the
transposition of one function into another.  A
visual illustration may make clear what I mean:
Imagine the projection of a geomtrical figure
on aplane with both figure and plane moving in
space, each with its own arbitrary and varying 
speeds of translation and rotating.  The immediate
form of the projection is determined by the
relative orientation between the figure and the
plane to have motions of their own, a highly
complex and seemingly unpredictable image
will result.  Further variations are possible
by having the form of the geometrical figure
change as well as the speeds."
This is uncannily akin to a description of music
produced by one of Erv Wilson's higher-dimensional
just intonation lattices using changing timbres.
