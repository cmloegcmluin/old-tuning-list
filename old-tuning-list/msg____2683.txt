I suspect that Neil was refering to the same thing as (Bill Alves was it?),
when Neil said that he usually work with modal music, and when Bill said that
the only limitation with JI (on a fixed number of tones per octave) is making
everything sound the same on all tonal centers.  

   Neil could perhaps be said to be presenting the microtonal equivalent of the
traditional view of modality.  The two are exactly analogous if not exactly
identical:  Modulating a melody within a seven-steped diatonic scale without
adding the appropriate chromatics, changes major thirds into minor, producing
the familiar modal feeling change.  Similarly, starting with a justly tuned 12
(or whatever) toned scale, and modulating it to another tonal center without
adding additional pitches as needed, will change 5:4s into 81:64s for example.
It's a different sort of feeling change, in that we don't hear major-to-minor
shifts, but it's exactly identical in that we hear shifts between very different
sounding major thirds.
