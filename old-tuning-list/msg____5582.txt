Your ears guide you well.  You are responding to two things-
	1.  Partch's instruments such as the Diamond Marimba and the Boo
(both included in the 1956 "Barstow" revision) are inharmonic (do not have
overtone partials which relate to the harmonic series).  These instruments
also have such short ring-times that you could not hear the overtones
relating even if they were well-tuned.
	2.  As Partch progressed through life, he became more inclined to
write dissonant, "mistuned" music which is based on his "Monophonic Scale,"
but is not necessarily in what would be purists would consider to be Just
Intonation.  Most people won't tell you this because they have not exmained
his scores in detail (his tablature-noation makes this prohibitively
time-consuming).
