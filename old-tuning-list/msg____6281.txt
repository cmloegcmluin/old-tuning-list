The Sanderson machine is from Inventronics Inc.  9 Acton Road
Chelmsford, Ma 01824-341.  or call 1-800-FAST440.
    The Sanderson machine does all the things  mentioned, and much more.  It
measures the relative inharmonicity in three places on a piano, and
calculates an extremely consistant 12ET tuning program.  It can measure the
amount of overpull to leave a flat piano in tune and also at pitch.   It is
also programmable, just pick your note, pick the harmonic you will use as an
index, ( or use the fundamental, doesn't matter),  assign a value to the
cents window,( to within .1 cent), and wham! that note is registered, and you
can tune anything to it by stopping the lights.  This is a midi-compatible
machine with automatic note recognition, designed primarily for professional
piano tuners.  High end model is about $1,800. Used ones, when you can find
them average about $1,000.
      My strongest attachment to it is the ease which it allows in applying
Jorgensen's research to any of the modern pianos. I don't have to spend years
learning primitive aural techniques,  I can just apply the  alterations to my
existing tunings, (that I have worked out!), and instantly have access to the
differences between say a Prinz and a Stanhope.
         Machines like this are the strongest hope for increased temperament
awareness today, as too few tuners can afford the time to learn what is a
present, a lightly demanded skill.  If professional tuners can produce these
tunings, I think a demand can be created. We shall see.
