Subject: EM and EMI articles

From: "J. Pusey" <pusey@remqhi.ENET.dec.com>

The latest issue of Electronic Musician (December 1995) -- probably just now
hitting the newsstands -- features an article entitled "Tuning Up" by someone
named Rob Shrock. The article discusses something called "dynamic intonation"
on MIDI instruments. Perhaps some folks on the list will find this interesting.
What I found more interesting was a sidebar to the article by Scott Wilkinson
plugging the MIDI Tuning Standard. Even more interesting was another sidebar
(uncredited) which mentioned the Just Intonation Network and its web site
and also -- drum roll, please -- the Alternate Tuning Mailing List! Perhaps
this will generate some new subscribers to this list. Too bad we don't have
a FAQ handy for newcomers.

On a somewhat unrelated note (tone?), I happened across the lastest issue of
the journal Expermental Musical Instruments (vol 11, no. 2). Among other
articles, this issue includes one entitled "The Monochord" by Sasha
Bogdanowitsch which covers some history of the monochord, a few tips for
construction of a monochord, and some scale charts. This issue of EMI also
mentions their web site at http://www.thecombine.com/emi (mostly still under
construction it seems).
