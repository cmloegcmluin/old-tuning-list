Subject: Re: Johnny's Lingua Franca Notation

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

I would continue to stress that an extension of Herf's notation, which 
allows for subdivision of 12-tet semitones into sixths (72-tet), to allow 
halves and quarters of the steps of 72-tet to be notated, seems most likely 
to lead to accurate results and will be structurally and audibly equivalent 
to any desired tuning that I can think of (that is, any tuning I think could 
be considered desirable). Cents notation, in addition to being arbitrary 
from an acoustical or pedagogical standpoint, requires no fewer symbols 
(two) in addition to the usual notation.

I would disagree with Adam Silverman as to the importance of a universal 
notation. Different notational systems will no doubt be more useful for 
"thinking" and composing in, and discussing, particular systems, such as 
meantone (where conventional notation works), Partchian tuning, or 22-tet. 
More use of electronic means (such as MIDI) and composer-produced recordings 
will obviate much of the need for a standard notation. However, I would 
agree with Adam that if we want to educate a new generation of performers so 
that they can participate in the flowering of microtonal music, a "standard" 
notational system would seem desirable, to make life easier for them and to 
give the widest variety of music a chance of being performed correctly.
