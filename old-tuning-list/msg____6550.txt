   Wow.  I personally have never noticed anything to even close to that.

   But perhaps that depends in what sense you're asking people to
"distinguish" those intervals.  For example, I have no doubt that almost
anybody with even casual musical training could distinguish a chromatic
scale in ... oh, say 31TET ... from a glissando.

   Perhaps that's too elementary of a distinguishing task though.  But even
among some more subtle tasks, like noticing 19TET's flat M3 and P5, and
comparing that to 31's right-on M3 and slightly flat P5, or to 12TET's
way-sharp M3 and almost exact P5, I have found that there are many musical
settings where those factors are audible.

   I certainly do agree that there are many musical settings where the
notes are just simply wizzing by too fast to hear those aspects of a tuning
as such.  If that's the sort of distinction exercise you're talking about,
then I'd agree with your conclusion up to a point anyway.

   But there certainly are many other ways in which the nature of the
tuning in which a composition is played can become apparent even if the
notes are screaming by too fast to carefully evaluate the tuning of each
one individually.  For example, even a very fast melody, provided that it
is at least somwhat scalar, played in a tuning that has a comparatively
flat leading tone (like 19TET or 31TET), is easy to hear as having that
characteristic.

   So, I guess I'd have to hear more about the nature of the limitation
you've noticed before I can comment on it in greater detail.

   By the way, the fact that 22TET is not "cyclic" (I presume by that you
mean specifically that its major scale and its modes are not cyclic), opens
up some intriguing musical possibilities, like seemingly impossible
modulations.
