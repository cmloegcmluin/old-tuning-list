Sorry if this sounds like extraneous mail, but I'd like to add in my own
"hear hear!" to Eduardo's comments there.  It is indeed very critical for us to
apply these theories, and the more personally we do so the more meaningful the
experience.  Live acoustic music on stage is perhaps second only to live
acoustic music on a one-on-one basis, which obviously isn't terribly realistic
for reaching the masses.  

   And I too am very pleased that Neil and his troopers have added their names
to the likes of Johnny and Mayumi Reinhard in providing this unique pleasure to
audiences.  The best part of this is that these people do a great job!
