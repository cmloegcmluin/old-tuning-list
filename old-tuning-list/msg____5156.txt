That's an interesting suggestion, but an indication would be needed for
the case when an incomplete genus is used, to avoid confusion with
complete Euler-Fokker genera.

An Euler-Fokker genus is what results if the tones of what Euler calls
a "complete chord" are reduced within one octave. So the prime 2 is
always omitted. Each prime is listed as many times as its
multiplicity. A complete chord or genus musicum contains all the
harmonics (including the first) of its fundamental, which are also
subharmonics of its guide tone (i.e. the lowest common multiple of all
tones). So for example the chord 1:3:5:15 is complete and 3:5:15 is
not. If a lattice diagram is drawn of a complete chord it is always
rectangular if you take one dimension for each prime.
In a genus, any tone may be taken as the tonic. Genus [335] could be: 

    A - E - B         C - G - D
    |   |   |    or   |   |   |     etc.
    F - C - G         Ab- Eb- Bb
