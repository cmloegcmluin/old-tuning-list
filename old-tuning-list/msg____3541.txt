Subject: King Crimson

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

I just purchased the King Crimson boxed set, "The Great Deceiver: Live 
1973-1974," and I have to say that right now I can't think of a better 
representative of what is unique in 20th century music. I'm not going to use 
this space to review it, but I will mention that in their rejection of 
diatonicity and triadic harmony, King Crimson often deliberately ventured 
outside the confines of 12-tET -- witness the artful use of bends and 
natural harmonics, or the Gamelan-like pizzicato wah-wah violin in "Tight 
Scrummy." If you have $60 to spend on rock or improvisatory music, or just 
want to be taken for a ride through the emotional extremes of sublime 
gentleness to raw vicious power, this is the way to go.

Warning: For the Neil Haversticks out there, there is very little that is 
heartwarming or uplifting about this music. Thinking about the 20th century, 
and the loss of innocence that it spelled for Western culture, this music 
could hardly be more appropriate.
