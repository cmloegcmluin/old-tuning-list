Subject: Approaching TD 1000!

From: madole@ella.mills.edu (David Madole)

Hi Tuning List,

As those of you that have been around a while know, every once in a
while (it has been a long time now!) I post a short statistical summary
of the Tuning list.  It seems that as the list approaches Digest 1000
(just three more to go!) such a posting would be appropriate, with
perhaps a bit of historical stuff.

The list was started on February 2 1994 by Greg Higgs and myself, and
announced on USENET.  By the Feb 3 we were congratulating ourselves
because we had 25 subscribers!  In less than a year, the list had grown
and brought the machine it was originally implemented on (a NeXT "Turbo
slab") to a virtual standstill, so it was moved to its current home
(eartha@mills.edu).

As of Feb 23rd, 1997, the list had 350 subscribers, distributed around the
globe/nets as follows.  (List membership normally oscillates between a
high of about 360 and a low of about 325.  That is, it is about 90%
stable.)

Austria 3, Australia 18, Canada 13, Switzerland 2, Commercial Providers
100, Germany 12, US Education 101, Spain 3, Finland 1, France 4, US
Government 2, Greece 2, Hong Kong 2, India 1, Italy 2, Japan 4, Korea
1, US Military 1, Mexico 1, "Network (.net)" 30, the Netherlands 10,
Norway 1, Non-profit Organizations 9, Poland 1, Sweden 3, Singapore 1,
United Kingdom 20, "United States" 1, South Africa 1.

(Note: there is no way of geographically locating the "Commercial"
subscribers, although a majority seem to be in English speaking
countries.)

I would like to comment here that, although the US Education subscribers
have the barest of pluralities(!), the shift toward commercial and
international subscribers over the last couple of years has been
dramatic.  It seems that for the first year or so, about 75-80% of the
subscribers were US Education (.edu).  Now they are about 28%.

There have been 5695 messages posted to the list, and the archive now
contains 15.3 Megabytes of data (including mail headers, etc.).

The list physically resides at Mills College in Oakland, California, USA,
currently on an SGI Indy.  Oakland is across the Bay from San Francisco.
