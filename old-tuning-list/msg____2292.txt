Subject: A new rhythmic vocabulary
---
"All things come from thence, from
that universal rule either directly proceeding
or by way of sequence." [Marcus Aurelius,
"Meditations"]
The previous post explored the outer
edges of rhythm by suggesting an
extension of the waveform periodicity
in the frequency domain of non-just
non-equal-tempered scales up into
the beat level of the individual measure.
As mentioned, there is a complete and
utter lack of generalized rhythmic
vocabulary to talk about these kinds
of divisions of the beat.  We can talk
sensibly in Western music about "half notes,"
"3 eighth notes in the time of 2," and so on,
and we can even (with some difficulty)
talk about "40% of a half note" (notated
as the N-tuplet `8 in the time of 5'),
but when it comes to something like
1/1.61803399 of a half note, conventional
Western notation falls mute.  Indeed, there
is not even the ghost of a clue where to
start talking about such divisions of the
beat except in raw numbers--which are
tremendously hard to deal with intuitively,
or manipulate as ensembles without huge
amounts of gratuitous calculation.
What does this have to do with tuning?
It seems clear that the natural way to compose
in non-just non-equal-tempered scales is to
extend the frequencies into divisions of the
beat.  But what we want is a simple way of
manipulating such rhythms.  Ideally, we should be
able to easily and simply apply such familiar
concepts as rhythmic augmentation and diminution
to sets of rhythms derived from the pitches of
non-just non-equal-tempered scale frequencies.
If we can't do this, it cripples us at the start 
in composing with non-just non-equal-tempered
scales.
First, let me suggest a generalization of the
standard Western rhythmic vocabulary.
Traditionally, divisions of the beat are 
handled with a descriptive vocabaular that
directly specifies the division of the beat:
half note lasts one half a whole note,  quarter
note lasts one quarter of a whole, triplet
quarter packs 3 quarters into the time of 2,
and so on.  This is fine as far as it goes. But
extending to anything other than simple
integer divisions of the beat is impossible:
there's no such thing as a "1.618034-note."
Instead, permit me to suggest what the
computer programmers have christened
a "call by reference," rather than the
"call by value" of conventional Western
rhythmic vocabulary.
Instead of using words for the divisions
of the beat that describe the actual 
values, suppose we use a rhythmic 
vocabulary which describes the successive
position of the rhythm in a hierarchy from
long to short.  This kind of rhythmic 
vocabulary could be applied to an unlimited
range of different divisions of the beat, rather
than the extremely limited set of integer
divisions of the beat which can be described
by traditional Western usage.
PRIMARY -- longest duration within the measure
SECONDARY -- next longest duration
TERNARY -- next longest
QUATERNARY -- next longest
..and so on.
With this change of vocabulary, it suddenly
becomes possible to write down a set of
rhythms derived from our non-just non-equal-
tempered scale:
P S S P T P 
Given the non-just non-equal-tempered
scale described in the previous post, this
is a set of notes of duration:
1.0 1/1.618034  1/1.618034 1.0 1/2.414213 1.0
In the context of this new rhythmic vocabulary,
all of the traditional techniques of Western
rhythm can be applied.  Here, augmentation
refers to multiplying all notes by the value
of 1/SECONDARY beat duration.  
In traditional Western usage, the secondary
beat duration is always 1/2, so augmentation
is always a simple doubling of note durations.
Contrariwise, diminution is a simple havling
of note durations.
In the context of the rhythms derived from our
non-just non-equal-tempered scale, however,
augmentation means multiplying all note
durations by 1.618034, while diminution 
means multipying all note durations by 
1/1.618034.
Embedded tuplets can also be carried over
into the new rhythmic scheme, with a
concomittant increase in rhythmic
complexity.  A triplet in traditional Western
usage is obtained by adding the primary to
the secondary duration; here it's obtained
by doing the same thing, but the result
(instead of being a 3:2 duration) is a 2.618034:1
duration.  And so on.
This gives us at least some reasonable way
to *talk* about rhythmic divisions derived
by time-scaling our non-just non-equal-tempered
micro-level of frequency up into the level
of the individual measure.  Because of the
obvious implications for new kinds of compositional
techniques, this derivation of rhythm from
non-just non-equal-tempered scale
frequencies clearly demands further
exploration.
The next post will discuss generalizations of
vertical structures in non-just non-equal-tempered
scales, along with an examination of consonant
vertical structures in a representative non-just
non-equal-tempered scale, along with several
kinds of near-equivalents to conventional modulation
between keys (equal temperaments) or 1/1s (JI).
