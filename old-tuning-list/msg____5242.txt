Subject: waking up to music

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

What a strange occurrence!  This morning I awoke to the sound of
construction (alas, not an unusual circumstance on my street)--the sound of
two unrecognizable motorized machines with large tubes extending down the
street and into a drainage-hole.  The machines each sounded like a leaf
blower, but they togethe emitted a strong overtone blast, not unlike the
lowest bagpipe ever made.  A low G featuring partials 1 and 3 (with a faint
5) resounded and the pitch imperceptibly crept upwards for about 5 minutes
to a C fundamental, and now it has gone back down to G, featuring partials
1:5:7, with 3 weakened.  It is an odd delight, this gasoline-powered
hurdy-gurdy.
