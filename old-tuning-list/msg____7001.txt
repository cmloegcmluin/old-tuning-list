I would be very surprised if any temperament significantly
different to 22 equal supported decatonic scales.  Vanishing
septimal commas is a difficult trick to pull off.

The octave is the best interval to define a harmonic scale around.
Once you've done that, the octave should be very accurate.
Although you should think about the octaves, it would be annoying
if "the same" chords in different registers were out of tune with
each other.

I tend to think that low primes should be tuned best.  The more
complex harmony you use, though, the more accuracy is required
for _all_ intervals.

Remember that there are a lot of temperaments out there!  Most of
what you can do in JI should work schismically, as all the commas
are there.

No, the tritone is not always the same pitch.  It can be 7/5, 10/7,
25/18 or 36/25. The first two do not arise in a diatonic context.
So, 25/18 is an augmented fourth and 36/25 a diminished fifth.  The
difference between them, 63 cents, is not negligible.  12-equal
enharmonies are irrelevant as diatonic scales work in all
meantones, and the notation reflects this.

When Paul Erlich says "scale steps" he obviously means the 7 note
diatonic scale.  I didn't have any trouble with this when I read
the paper first.
