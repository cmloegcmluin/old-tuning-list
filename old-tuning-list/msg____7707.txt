   I don't think that anybody would claim there to be any concern over
which number you is the denominator and which is the numerator.

   As for having both a steely cold 3 and a sweet 5 in a ratio, I think the
prime-limit proponent's answer would be that the larger prime always wins -
demands more attention.

   But again, I'm kind of a fence-sitter on the question of the basis of
limits.  A while back I would have towed the prime line, but now I'm not so
sure.
