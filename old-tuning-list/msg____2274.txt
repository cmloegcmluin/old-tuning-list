Subject: 72 tone clarinet

From: Jesse Canterbury <jeski@freenet.scri.fsu.edu>

Hello--
	I play clarinet and I am currently working on playing a
microtonal piece.  I purchased the Vol.1 No.4 Spring 1990 issue of
PITCH because it has a 72-tone clarinet fingering chart by Ian
Greitzer.  I am having problems following this fingering chart
though.  I don't know what keys on the clarinet correspond to the
numbers on this fingering chart. I looked on a standard Rubank, Boheme
chart and the numbers did not correspond to the chart in PITCH.  Also,
there are several occasions where there is one fingering written
underneath several different pitches.  Does that mean that that
fingering is used for all those pitches?  If anyone has any
information about this fingering chart, how to get in touch with Ian
Greitzer, or how to find another fingering chart, let me know. I am:
