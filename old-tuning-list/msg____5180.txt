Subject: Indian Music

From: TheNay@aol.com

Hello Everyone.

I want to begin compensating for my general ignorance of Classical Indian
Music and was wondering if anyone could recommend a more or less definitive
introduction to the subject.  I'm definitely interested in recordings, but
initially I would want to spend some time studying the theoretical basis of
the music.  I recently read the most basic of introductions to the
metaphysical basis of the ragas and talas and was completely fascinated.

In any case, any help would be greatly appreciated.  

Nathan
