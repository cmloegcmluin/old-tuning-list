Subject: Wish List - pitch resolution - must be MIDI tuning dump.

From: harmonic@globalnet.co.uk (Harmonics Inc.)

To ask manufacturers for low pitch resolution (less then the MIDI tuning
dump), may be fine for the tone-deaf newbies, who are still puzzling over
the fudging of commas.

For microtuning to have "earth-shattering" effects on the consciousness of
players and listeners, we need to be able to accurately control "beating".

Eventually we will get the required 1/196,608 units per octave; so why
encourage the manufacturers to to go for part measures to get there by
stages over decades?

Let's ask NOW for what we eventually want, and get it asap.

Please support and demand the MIDI tuning dump for hi-res tuning.
