Subject: Archive for current digests ?I lost one

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

It's nobody's fault but mine ,mine mine ,mine......

Actually it was a bug in ClarisWorks 5.0 that 's responsible.. :-(

I just lost Tuning Digest 1416 (today).Is there an archive for current 
digests ?
I checked ella.mills ,seems to stop in1997.
if it is not yet archived,could someone make like Cinderella's friend 
with the wand and mail me a copy ?
 I'm getting a lot out of the Prime/Odd thread and am anxious to read 
today's thrilling episode.
