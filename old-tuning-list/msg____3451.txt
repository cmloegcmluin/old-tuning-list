Subject: The Great Partch Debate

From: Bruce Campbell <CAMPBEB@cesmtp.ccf.org>

My mama should have learned me better than to step into the middle of a
brawl, but --

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I've been slogging through a
three-week backlog of mail.  I was tempted to enter the Partch fray early
on with words of wisdom (I'll bet every party involved believes theirs are
words of wisdom) but I thought that the battle would have been long
over by now.  It seems to be as acrimonious as ever, so here goes:

1)  How about agreeing that restrictions on transcriptions might be eased
up once there was a readily available body of "authentic" versions
available on CD?  It seems to me that the main objection is that
transcribed works are standing in for the real thing.  With the increasing
availability of Partch on record and in print [Revelation, Li Po, 4-CD set,
projected CRI release, publication of Bitter Music] it seems there's a
market.  Hopefully, there will be new recordings as well as re-released
early recordings.  Once a listener can refer to these there's less worry
about a transcription completely misrepresenting Harry's work. [That still
won't solve the corporeality problem, I know.]

2) In regard to the hording of the instruments I have the following story to
relate:
In 1977, when I lived in southern California, I found out that Partch's
instruments were being kept at San Diego State.  I drove down and
spoke with Danlee Mitchell and told him I was interested in Harry's music
and theories.  He didn't know me from Adam but he gave me access any
time I wanted to the instruments.  They were kept in two big
climate-controlled rooms.  Well, I guess they were big rooms, but they
were still plenty crowded.  He let me in, then left me alone with them.  I
still can't believe that kind of trust and generosity. There was a big pile of
scores in there, too.  I was a dumb kid, though, and made poor use of it. 
It meant four hours on the road each time I visited, which meant I didn't
get there very often, and there was more than a bit of a learning curve,
so I didn't feel like I accomplished much while I was there.  I came 5 times
over a period of 3 months or so, then moved back east without a word. 
So, Danlee, if you see this, thanks for the opportunity -- and sorry I blew
it.  It was wonderful, though, to be allowed so near to something that
otherwise could only have been legendary to me.

3)  About synthesizer substitutions.  Leaving aside corporeality and
theatrical presentation, it sounds like it should work.  What makes me
wary is a recording I have of Yankee Doodle Fantasy done on synth. 
I've never heard any other version so I can't say where the fault lies -- I
don't know, that is, if it's a bad representation of Harry's music or if Harry
was having an off day -- but it makes me embarrassed for him every
time I hear it (not often).  If it was all the Partch I'd ever heard I sure
wouldn't want to hear any more.  But, then, I feel that way about Castor
and Pollux, so what do I know?
