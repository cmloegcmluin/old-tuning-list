As always I find Neil Haverstick's comments very appropriate.  I think he's
right that music by academics often ends up appealing to few more than
academics.  Nothing wrong with appealing to academics in my book of course, but
Neil's certainly correct that there's a lot more folks out there than academics.


   I can think of one force that one could make a fair case of blame for this,
although I certainly resist the idea:  One could claim that academics are coming
up with new tunings faster than practical musicians like Neil, Johnny Reinhard,
and others can make good musical use of.  I resist that idea, because I
certainly don't want academics to stop coming up with new tunings ideas.
Perhaps the concern is that we're not encouraging them to explore those tunings
thoroughly enough before they move on?
