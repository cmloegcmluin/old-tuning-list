Subject: Kami's post on Indian music

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...Kami's post on Indian systems fits exactly with a
book I've been reading by Alain Danielou, "Music and the Power of
Sound"...Danielou takes a look at Indian, Chinese, and Greek systems
of tuning, and talks frequently about the question Kami asked when he
wondered which pitches were appropriate at various times in a raga.
It seems, according to Danielou, that pure pitches have exact corres-
pondences with emotional states in man, times of day, metaphysical
concepts, and much more, which is only hinted at in the book...in other
words, it's a deep and true subject, and one which is rarely, if ever,
addressed by most musicians (at least in the western system).
When DO you use a particular pitch, indeed, and what are the implications
thereof? How do we find out the answer to this most ultimate of
musical questions...and if, as Danielou suggests, the tempered scale
is out of harmony with the natural laws of musical pitch organization
(which, of course, we definitely know it is), what is the cumulative
spiritual effect of all these out of jharmony (as opposed to out of
tune) intervals? I am beginning to realize that this is perhaps the
most important issue facing musicians in the world today.
I believe we are in a most crucial time in the history of this planet,
and the decisions we make now will have a great impact on future
evenys...I also believe artists have a lot more power than we are
seeing, for the most part...at least we have the ability to be using
our gifts for more creative ends than most music I currently hear.
So, Kami's question is most appropriate, and one which we tuning folks
have the resources to begin to grapple with...I plan on taking my
music as far as possible, so this means really looking for the true
meaning and purpose of music...by studying the harmonic clues left
to us by the Creator, I believe a great and powerful music can arise,
one with the ability to heal and make positive waves in the very
structure of the Universe...which sruti, eh?   Hstick
