Subject: My 1200 cents

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

While I realize that the current controversy about Harry 
Partch's music is over instrumentation, the real shame 
is that money was spent on a transcription for speaker and
string quartet. This money could have been well spent 
on new recordings of his complete works.

Last month at Merkin Hall in NYC I heard US Highball 
as performed by Newband. A true high point in my 
concert going life. I have only heard the murky recording 
on Enclosure 2. It would be a real shame if a Kronos 
version was released before a Newband version. Or if a
Newband version on the original instruments was never
released at all!

I enjoy the Kronos version of Barstow, but do we need 
yet another version of Barstow or Two Studies (of which 
Kronos have not released a recording)?
