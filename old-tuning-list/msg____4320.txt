Subject: no pudding

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

I've left a couple of Cage performances because I was
bored.  That does  _NOT_  mean I think Cage is boring. 
It means the performances in question were boring to
me.  Cage is all about communication.  Often,
communication is the  _ONLY_  thing that exists in his
work.  When performing "Silence," for example, the
mentality and concentration of the performer make a
difference between an audience finding it intriguing or
stupid.

same people at home, alone in their rooms....  No flow,
no interaction, no marvelous concordances (or
discords) - just someone meditatively whonking and
stroking a big hunk of metal, accompanied by a
gradually evolving sound-field.  A thought:  John Cage
might have been proud.

This seems harsh to Cage, who would probably have
been bored, too, if you were.  I think he liked pudding
just as much as the next guy.

But I agree with what Jonathan seems to be saying:
There's no point to a concert if there's no pudding.
