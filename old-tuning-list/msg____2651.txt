Gary commented: Amusingly, I seem to recall more people 
playing in two different tunings at the same time (which 
has always struck me personally as rather confusing).

I don't know about others, but Ive had lots of fun 
mixing tunings...
About two years ago I write a piece (called "Incidences 
and Coincidences") that mixed 12 and 19. Parts of the 
piece were in 12, parts in 19. Of the two major themes, 
one is in 12 harmonized by 19, while the other is in 19 
harmonized by 12. In addition, the two themes used a 
different relationship between the 12 and the 19, i.e., you 
have a wide range of choices of how the two are tuned 
relative to each other. Probably the simplest way is to let 
them have a note in common, but this is not necessary. 
One of the themes had a common tone, but the other I just 
tuned "by ear." I never went back to figure out exactly 
how they are tuned relative to each other, but I'm sure 
they didn't have any notes in common.
