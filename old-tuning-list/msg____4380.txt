It took me a bit of digging into the list processor to find out, but 
here's how you do it; send a message to listproc@eartha.mills.edu 
including this text:

get listproc/lists/tuning digest.905

Change the number at the end to the digest you want. If you don't know 
which digest you want, there are indexes of subject headers for some 
archives. There are also text string search commands and other useful 
stuff that the list processor can do. Send the command HELP alone in a 
message to get started on decoding the list processor. 
 
I just started receiving the daily list and I've been working backwards 
through the archives as well, which is how I found your letter above.
