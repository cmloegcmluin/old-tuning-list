I would guess that 24tET would be a good example, since its best
approximations of 3 and 5 coincide with those of 12tET, so the only way
to generate it with Fokker's method would be to choose some rather large
"comma" to vanish. For example, if the chromatic semitone vanishes, then
(1 -2) is a unison vector, and then if the Pythagorean comma vanishes as
well, (12 0) is a unison vector, and the determinant is
(1*0)-(-2*12)=24. The 5 axis is then represented by 7deg24, while 8deg24
is of course a better approximation.
