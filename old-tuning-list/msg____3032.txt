Subject: Brian's Partch questions

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

When dealing with Partch's music it is important to remember a couple of 
things.  First, that there was a distinction (as there is in most music) 
between theory and practice.  HP built the instruments to get 
just-intervals, and then composed idiomatic patterns within the 
Monophonic scale which often fit the hand better than the book.  Notably 
is "The Letter" whose two chords (utonal/otonal flux) are related very 
remotely (by 81/49, if memory serves me correctly).  Nonetheless, this is 
a progression of great ingenuity.

Secondly, that it is not always pretty nor elegant.  Idealt with that 
quite recently, and have since gained a new appreciation for his work.

Adam
