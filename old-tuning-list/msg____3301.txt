Subject: HP debate

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Bill asked will Purchase become the Harry Partch Bayreuth?  Clever, but 
it brings up a recollection.  Dean Drummond told me that nobody is 
allowed to play the instruments except for Newband and invited guests, who are 
always among the top percussionists in NYC--not even SUNY Purchase 
students who want to devote the time to learning on a regular basis.  
When I pressed him on this point, he agreed that if I moved to Purchase, 
I could assist in maintenance and tuning, which would give me plenty of 
time with the instruments.  I would never, however, play any ensemble 
works.  It gives people like me (aspiring kitharists without the money 
or  expertise to make one) almost no chance at all to get involved with 
them.  I wonder how many of HP's ensemble members would have made the 
Newband cut (no fingers pointed, just a question).  I had hoped that 
perhaps two ensembles could be involved--Newband plus an 
ensemble-in-training.

On another point, there *is* anecdotal evidence about how Harry wrote his 
melodies.  Ben Johnston told me (and the scores attest) that Harry's 
vocal lines for Barstow, US Highball and earlier pieces were not 
precisely microtonal, but *freely ad libbed*.  Later, he found it easier 
just to transcribe his performances while retaining the natural style in 
order to guide the performers who sang when HP didn't do the deed himself.

As to corporealism, Li Po *is not a corporeal piece* since his theories 
of corporealism were not yet in place.  Staging it would be 
extra, and in my opinion, distracting from the simple elegance of the 
songs.  The Greek Studies are also noncorporeal, as well as probably are 
most of the smaller songs such as many of the Intrusions, The Letter, 
etc.  Bitter Music is noncorporeal, yet multi-media.

I grant that it would be silly to produce a "concertante" version of The 
Bewitched.  How effective would it be to stage Bless This Home?  I'll go 
further and argue that a staging of Barstow would be nothing better than 
a pantomime, since the piece is inherently the text plus accompaniment, 
and lacks a coherent dramatic concept, such as that found in Water! Water!.
