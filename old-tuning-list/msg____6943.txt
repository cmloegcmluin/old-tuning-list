Well, I use a lot of instruments. Some of these are mine, others belong to
the center or are on loan to me or the center. I and feel a little awkward
taking up so much space on this forum with a list of them, since there is a
big section of the SEJIC web site devoted to them.  But I'll give it a start:

1. Paia Theremax thermin (all pitches and tunings)

2. Cosmolyra - originally built by Ivor Darreg, restored by Buzz Kimball and
then put into it's final form by me:

        Side 1: Harmonic Series 4-16 on G=384 cps.
        Side 2: Subharmonic Series 3-12
        Side 3: - Otonality hexad: 4/5/6/7/9/11
                - Utonality Hexad: 4/5/6/7/9/11
                - 6 unisons for chorused melody
        Side 4: Harmonics 1 (tripled), 2,3,4 (doubled)

3. Starrboard- Strings tuned to harmonics 2-18 and subharmonics 1-12. Fretts
remain in equal temperament, so modulation is limited to factors of 3 and 2.

4. Electric diamond marimba -built by Jeff Bunting - same layout as Harry
Partch's, but made of steel bars with magnetic pickups under each.

5. Bass Marimba - Harmonics 2-10 with added 9/32 and 27/64

6. Wood Xylophones - One is harmonic series 16-32 on C, repeated in 4.5
dupeles. the other is Subharmonics on G and C with harmonics on A, Eb, Ab and F.

7. Hammerstrings - Harmonics 2-18 on C=256, subharmonics 1-12 in high
register, Subharmonics 1- 19 in low register.

8. Orchestral Chimes - harmonics 3-16 on C. Subharmonics, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 11, with duple (higher) equivelents of 7, 9, 11.

9. Tubular Bells - Harmonics 4-24, Subharmonics 2-12.

10. Fretless electric guitar.

11. Guitar refretted to harmonic series 24-48 (Lots of modes and keys
available).

12. Set of Fipple Pipes and custom recorders to play Entire 17 limit matrix.

13. Arp 2500 analog synthesizer.

14. Ensoniq Mirage - with tuneable operating system.

15. 2 TX81Z's, Kawaii K5, Proteus/2, controlle with Oberheim XK MIDI
controller and Casio Digital Horn controller. Tuned and sequenced by means
of two PC,s running Microtonal MIDI terminal and various other programs.

16. Two Mbiras.

17. Various Effects devices.

18. All sorts of Drums and Percussion stuff.

All this stuff is available for use by guests and residents at the Southeast
Just Intonation Center.
