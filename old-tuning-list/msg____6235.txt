Subject: 19/22

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Someone wanted to chat about 19 and 22 equal temp...I have no hands
on experience with 22 yet, but I've been playing 19 for 8 years...here's
a few thoughts. First, it's amazing how much 19 can resemble 12/oct eq
temp, especially on first hearing...yet, on a little deeper level,
there's all sorts of little twists and turns that twist the ear. 19 is
very good for chordal work...the 3rds are better than 12, but the 5th is
a bit flatter (and, as my ear has improved, this has become more
noticeable). It also has a very nice #4 and b5, and a #major 3rd which is
only 6 cents # of the 7/9 ratio...this can be put to good use in many
ways, especially at brisk tempos. I find 19 good for extending the forms
of blues, jazz, and country, which I feel they are in dire need of...for
example, I have rewritten Coltrane's "Giant Steps" for 19, and it's a
hoot...as well as extremely difficult to play.
    Plus, you now get the ability to modulate through 19 different
major/minor keys; for those into chordal music, this is a great
opportunity to explore new territory.
I'm not crazy about the b7th...too sharp for me. All in all, it's a great
tuning to explore as an entry into the world of non 12 tunings...of
course, as Ivor Darreg always pointed out, each tuning has it's own mood,
and this understanding can be very valuable for those who are interested
in considering moving into this field.

    Again, on the subject of 31/et...I have had no problem manuvering
around the fretboard of my 34 tone guitars, so I don't see why 31 would
be a problem...you just have to be really precise, and
determined...Hstick
