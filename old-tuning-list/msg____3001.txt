Subject: Refretting guitars

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
	Common practice in guitar building is to fret the neck as if no 
string stretching would take place and compensate at the bridge for the 
stretching that takes place when the guitar is fretted at the octave 
(12th fret, 31st fret, whatever determines the octave for any particular 
instrument). This is a compromise between accurate tuning over the 
whole neck and ease of setting the bridge piece (comparing the pitch of 
the open string or octave harmonic to that of the string fretted at 
the octave can be done by ear). I know of no realistic way to build a guitar 
that has 
correct stretching compensation over the whole neck, but if you lay the 
frets out with no compensation for stretching and adjust the bridge to 
give correct pitch in the area you expect to play in most (rather that 
at the octave), you will probably be quite satisfied with the results. 
	There are a few builders working on computerized retunable guitars, 
so that the artist can quickly change string tension, but these are not 
currently operating well enough for discriminating users. Certainly a 
guitar could be built in which the position of the bridge pieces were 
quickly adjustable to account for stretching at different locations on 
the neck (servo or stepper motor control or some mechanical linkage), but 
this seems like overkill for a relatively small problem. When a guitar is 
well set up (proper neck relief, nut height, bridge height, string guages,
etc), the standard octave compensation is surprisingly good. 
	Also, please do not consider movable nut pieces to compensate for 
string stretch. The nut should have the same function as a zero fret, and 
if it is accurately placed and set it will act as a zero fret.  
	In short, put the frets where they should be assuming no string 
stretch from fretting, set the guitar up properly and then adjust the 
bridge to compensate in the middle of the most played area.
