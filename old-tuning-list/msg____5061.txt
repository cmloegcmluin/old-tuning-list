A slightly lower unweighted sum of sq'ed errors, duh, by definition.

My weighting scheme is based on Partch's "Observation One" which claims that 
the field of attraction, in cents, of an interval is inversely proportional 
to the (odd-number) limit of the interval. Therefore the errors must be 
multiplied by the limit to get the error in units of the field of 
attraction. Your weighting scheme can be seen as a compromise between this 
and equal-weighting. I think leaning towards equal weighting is appropriate 
when the music tends to use complete chords and the various intervals 
reinforce one another.
