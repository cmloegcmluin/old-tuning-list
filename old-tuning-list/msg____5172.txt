Music with 31 Notes._ Verlag fur systematische Musikwissenschaft GmbH, Bonn.

The prime limit definition should NOT be the default, despite its utility in 
describing a tuning system. The odd limit definition is not intended to 
describe a tuning system; it is intended to describe musical practice. 
Despite what Jonathan Walker said, one does not consider music in 
Pythagorean tuning to be a  531441-limit system under the odd definition of 
limit. Even under Partch's own (odd) definition, Partch's music was 
11-limit, not 33-limit nor some product of powers of numbers through 11. 
Partch listened carefully and came up with the most useful definition for 
the ear and for musical practice, not for studying the mathematics of tuning 
systems.

The definition is: A piece of music is N-limit if all intervals whose 
(heard) rational approximations use odd numbers up to N, and all chords 
containing only such intervals, are considered consonant, while intervals 
which cannot be so approximated, or any chord containg at least one such 
interval, are considered dissonant. In other words, it's how high up the 
harmonic series (or how far down the subharmonic series) the ear is asked to 
go in a particular piece.

So with a few caveats (such as second-inversion triads) common-practice 
music is 5-limit. The difference between the prime and odd definitions 
really shows up at the first composite odd number, 9. As Dan Wolf and I have 
pointed out before, there can be a very real difference between 7-limit 
music, where 9 is only possible as 3*3, and 9-limit music, where 9 is 
independently available as a harmonic building block.

I'm sure I could have said some things better here, I look forward to 
discussing more because this is an important issue!
