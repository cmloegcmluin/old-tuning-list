Subject: Swingle singers sing Ben Johnston?

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

I just read an interview with Ben Johnston on the 'net, I think I got there 
from the Just Intonation Network homepage. Anyway, a Swingle Singers 
recording of Ben Johnston's music was mentioned. Apparantly Ben approved of 
their intonation. Anyone know how I can get a hold of a copy of this? I was 
brainwashed as a kid into loving the Swingle Singers. Speaking of them, and 
off the subject of tuning, who did the first jazzy interpretations of Bach? 
The Modern Jazz Quartet? Jazzy Bach was a trick that every prog-rock band 
had know, listen to Jethro Tull, Yes, etc., but only Focus took it a step 
further and wrote their own jazzy neo-Baroque suites. Score one more for the 
Dutch for musical creativity!
