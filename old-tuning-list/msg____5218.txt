Subject: Re: Tail Wagging the Dog?

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Since an instrumentalist, all the way through teaching theory, I have
considered "music theory" as an abstraction, a scaffold built from music
proper. Theorists were "after-the-fact" people that gave explanations for
why things are the way they are.

Significantly, this list indicates that this may no longer be so.  With
"microtonal" theory, composers are eager to follow the findings of
theorists (some of whom may also be composers).  Instrumentalists will
put in the neccessary sweat to find fingerings, but first the music's 
theory must be adequately laid out.

Frankly, I am elated that theory merits greater importance with its
mapping of ever new pitch relationships. 

Microtonal theorists can be proud of the positive influence they have 
on new compositions and on the higher general understanding of players and
listeners, oh...and instrument builders.
