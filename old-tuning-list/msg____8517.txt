Dear all,
Last two weeks I was very busy with our 2nd Festival de Guitarra Ciudad
de Montevideo, and  I was and I am very preocupied with the Yamaha
Patent related to 19.
Some of you might email me the Grants or the whole patent ?
Many years ago I patented in Buenos Aires (Argentina) a general
fretboard design .
I have this documents. It looks like some of the interchangeables Mark's
fretboards.
I have also; many years ago, patented here in Montevideo the SCALE
