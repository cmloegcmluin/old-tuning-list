I guess it is clear that Brian inhabits a totally different world from 
the one I live in.  And I'm not talking about locale, either.

To my ears "pressing buttons on electronic technology" is the least 
satisfactory musical sound.  Vocal sound is the primal musical sound and 
that is not discussed.  Truth, most who press buttons can't hear in 
their heads what they are supposed to produce audibly.

We live at time where there are multitudes of great musicians, ready to 
play anything.  I don't know if they need an endangered species act, but 
it would be a shame if they will soon need refugee status.  

Here in New York City musicians will read any notation that makes use of 
their training.  So - Julian Carrillo's 96-ET music in his original 
number notation has always required transcription to a plus or minus of 
49 cents above a quartertone notation.  Lesson: the more foreign the 
notation the less likely a performance by master musicians.

Gardner Read's "20th Century Microtonal Notoation" demonstrates that there
are a myriad of notations, as there are multiplicity of tunings.  Perhaps 
notation reflects profoundly a creators aesthetic as does the choice 
of tuning, or instrumental color, or form, etc.

It is self-prophesizing to proclaim that the unexperienced doesn't 
exist.  Somehow I am surpsrised that with all the traveling that AFMM 
is involved in there has never been an invitation to perform on the West 
coast.

There is yet beautiful music to be made on CDs that are acoustic and that 
use the resonant instruments that human heritage has produced.  I believe it 
is a mistake to alienate yourself from the grass roots of sound.  New 
sounds are great, too!  Love homemade stuff.  MMmmm.  Even great 
electronics, sometimes.
