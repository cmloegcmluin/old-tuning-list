Subject: a new book

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick...just yesterday I got a book titled "Tuning" by Owen
Jorgensen...without getting long winded, it appears very interesting and
well researched...has anyone out there read it yet? One comment he made
which I found fascinating was that there was no true equal temperament
on piano before this century because the technology to tune EQ did not
exist until then...is this true? I certainly don't know, but would find
it most amusing if this was so. He really seems to have done his
homework, and his accounts of various historical tunings (and detailed
instructions on how to tune a piano to them) are fascinating...keep me
posted...Hstick
