Subject: Tuning Digest research tips

From: Mark Nowitzky <nowitzky@alum.mit.edu>

FYI, there's an "automatic" way to handle stuff like this:

The so-called "list processor" can get you this stuff automatically.  What
you do is send emails to listproc@eartha.mills.edu, telling the machine what
you want in the text of the message.

For example, to find references to Gregg Gibson, send an email to
listproc@eartha.mills.edu, with the following in the text of the message:

        search tuning gregg&gibson

This'll return to you (in a couple of minutes) an email containing the names
of all files in the archive containing "gregg" and "gibson".  Then, you can
send another email, a "view" request, to listproc@eartha.mills.edu to get
the file(s) you want.

This mechanism also handles the "lost digest" problem:

Send an email to listproc@eartha.mills.edu, with the following in the text
of the message:

        view tuning digest.1416

Notes:

1)  Be sure to send the requests to "listproc@eartha.mills.edu".  Do NOT
send them to "tuning@eartha.mills.edu", since they'll end up just being a
meaningless post.

2)  You might want to copy whatever text you're sending into the "Subject"
line as well, to help you rummage through them at a later date.

3)  Turn "off" any "signature" you might have on outgoing emails, 'cuz the
list processor will try to process the signature as more requests.  (If you
don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it - neither do I.)
