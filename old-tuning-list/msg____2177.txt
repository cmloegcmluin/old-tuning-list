>As an empirical science, psychoacoustics is largely concerned with 
>measuring the reactions of the ear/brain system to specific acoustic 
>stimuli. However, human hearing is a hierarchical process made up of many 
>layers of abstraction.  
>Small acoustic stimuli shade imperceptibly into larger ones, leading 
>inexorably to such large-scale percepts as "key center," "cadence," and
> "discordance" and "concordance." As Eberhard Zwicker points 
>out, "It is clear that psychoacoustics plays an important role in musical 
>acoustics.  There are many basic aspects of musical sounds that are 
>correlated with the sensations already discussed in psycoacoustics.  
>Examples may be different pitch qualities of pure tones and complex sounds, 
>perception of duration, loudness and partially-masked loudness, sharpness 
>as a an aspect of timbre, perception of sound impulses as events within the 
>temporal patterns leading to rhythm, roughness, and the equivalence of 
>sensational intervals.  For this reason it can be stated that most of this 
>book's contents are also of interest in musical acoustics. At this point we 
>can concentrate on two aspects that have not been discussed so far: musical 
>consonance and the Gestalt principle." [Zwicker, E. and H. Fastl, 
>Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models, 1990, pg. 312]
>Zwicker characterizes the hierarchical perception of musical tones by 
>drawing a distinction between sensory consonance (perceived roughness, 
>sharpness, and noisiness of the tone) and harmony, (perceived tonal 
>affinity, tolerability, and root relationship of tones or sequences of tones 
>to a scale).  
>So doing, he posits that both modes of perception are hierarchically involved
> in the sensation of musical consonance.
>Both experience and experiment tell us that the process of listening to 
>music involves levels of neural organization above the purely physical 
>acoustic operation of the inner ear.  While the point of maximal stimulation 
>on the basilar membrane indicates a simple mechanical Fourier analysis of 
>sounds entering the ear, the firing pattern of neural fibers in the auditory 
>nerve encodes pitch and spectral information in the nerve system in a 
>complex way.
>The path between primary auditory nerve and cerebral cortex is not a simple 
>one.  Many feedback loops control the processing of auditory information, 
>and there are many opportunities for higher brain centers to alter the raw 
>input travelling up the auditory nerve--and vice versa.
>The anatomy of the pathway between the auditiory nerve and   the cerebral 
>cortex is complex: the cells of the primary neurons (that is, those in the 
>auditory nerve) are located within the modiolus of the cochlea; these 
>primary nurons terminate in the cochlear nucleus, a mass of gray matter 
>located in the dorsal and lateral portion of the medulla oblongata. Here the 
>physical nerve connection breaks. From this point there is a synpatic 
>connection (mediated by neurotransmitters) to the neurons of the inferior 
>colliculus.  After another synpatic gap in the neural pathway, the third-
>order neurons converge on the medial geniculate body, the final relay station
> on the auditory path to the cerebral cortex. It's worth nothing that the 
>medial geniculate body not only collates fibers from the audtiory nerve, but 
>also from other sensory systems and from the cerebral cortex as well. Thus 
>the geniculate body serves not as a passive relay station so much as an 
>active filtering and integrating locus.
>>From the geniculate body, the fourth-order auditory neurons connect with 
>the cerebral conrtex by way of a thin sheet of radiating nerve fibers.  These 
>radiations include corticofugal fibers running from the cortex back to the 
>medial geniculate body.
>Thus the auditory neural pathway contains a complex feedback loop, 
>controlled by several sets of higher brain loci, running between the auditory 
>nerve and the cerebral cortex.  
>Most of the fourth-order neurons enter a small region ofthe posterial half 
>of the horizontal wall of the Sylvian fissure, which acts as a focal zone for 
>the entire auditory cortex. The complexity of the auditory region of the 
>Sylvian fissure is daunting: each cochlear fiber makes connections with 
>thousands of other neurons grouped in at least thirteen regions, and 
>populated by many different types of neurons. To make the process even 
>more complex, not all of these neurons respond identically. Some produce 
>strong signals when presented with tones in a 
>particular frequency range but do not respond to tones in other frequency 
>ranges. A small fraction of neurons emit strong signals when two different 
>frequencies are sounded together, but these same neurons produce little or 
>no response when either frequency sounds alone. Some neurons are most 
>strongly stimulated by sounds at specific amplitudes: sounds outside this 
>narrow amplitude window cause no resopnse from suchneurons. For yet other
> auditory nerve fibers, the higher the sound's amplitude, the stronger the 
>response, until a satuation point is reached. Some neurons respond best toe 
>amplitude-moedulated tones, others to frequency-modulated tones. Some 
>neurons respond with paritcular vehemence to sounds coming from a 
>particular region of space, and some neurons respond best to sounds that 
>are moving in space.
>Because these cortical loci consist of neural pathways, they are formed by 
>learned response and can be changed.  Thus, the impact of culture and 
>experience on musical perception is at least as great as the physical 
>sensory correlates of musical tone--if not greater.
>"I once attended...a concert in Bangkok that was totally mystifying. I could 
>see that the audience was utterly enraptured, swooning at moments of 
>apparently overwhelming emotional beauty that made no impression on me 
>whatsoever; not only that, I couldn't distinguish them from any other 
>moments in the piece." [Eno, Brian, "Resonant Complexity," Whole Earth 
>Review, May 1995, pg. 42]
>This points to a important caveat.  While the results adduced so far provide 
>evidence for this or that musical tuning system ont he basis of sensory 
>consonance, psychoacoustics cannot describe or validate the higher levels 
>of musical organization implicit in a tuning system.
>Thus the internal structure of a tuning is different from the sensory 
>consonance produced by intervals within that tuning.  For example: Risset's, 
>Pierce's and Sethares' timbral mapping procedure, following the 
>implications of research by Plomp and Levelt and Kameoka and Kuriyagawa, 
>allow a composer to control the level of *sensory consonance * in a given 
>tuning, but mapping the component partials of a sound into a given 
>maximally consonant set for a specific scale does *not * change the 
>inherent tonality of the scale, its Rothenberg propriety, the Barlow 
>harmonicity or the Wilson efficiency of the scale.
>In short, by changing timbre, note duration, and compositional style one can 
>change the surface affect of music produced in a given tuning: but the 
>deeper structural elements of the tuning remain invariant. 
>Ivor Darreg described one of the deeper structural invariants in a given 
>tuning as its "mood:" "In my opinion, the striking and characteristic moods 
>of many tuning-systems will become the most powerful and compelling 
>reason for exploring beyond 12-tone equal temperament. It is necessary to 
>have more than one non-twelve-tone system before these moods can be 
>heard and their significance appreciated." [Darreg, Ivor, "Xenharmonic 
>Bulletin No. 5, 1975, pg. 1]
>David Rothenberg proposed that the Rothenberg propriety of a scale 
>explains some aspects of the scale's deep structure; Clouth and Douthett 
>duplicated some of this work in their article "On Well-Formed Scales."  
>John Chalmers has speculated that Rothenberg propriety explains the sense 
>of tension in such tunings as Ptolemy's intense diatonic.
>In addition to the "mood" or overall "sound" of a given tuning, Darreg and 
>McLaren (1991) pointed out that each tuning exhibits some degree of 
>inherent bias toward melody or harmony.  The Pythagorean intonation and 
>13-tone equal temperament, for example, are both strongly biased toward 
>melody, while 31-tone equal temperament and 13-limit just intonation are 
>strongly biased toward harmony.
>Douglas Keislar made this same point in his 1992 doctoral thesis.  In it, 
>Keislar describes research which demonstrates that altering the surface 
>characteristics of the music--timbre, tempo, spatialization--does not 
>change the deeper structural characteristics of the tuning. Thus, while 
>mapped overtones will make a comopsition in 13-tone equal temperament 
>sound more acoustically smooth, it does not change the essentially atonal 
>character of the 13-tone scale, nor does it materially affect the scale 
>"mood." Similarly, changing the timbres of a composition in Ptolemy's 
>intense diatonic tuning will alter the degree of sensory roughness or 
>smoothness; adding reverberation will mask to greater or lesser degree 
>some of the overall "sound" of the composition.  But the sense of aesthetic 
>tension created by scale intervals which are, in Rothenberg's usage, 
>improper, will remain unchanged.
>Thus the implications for tuning suggested by psychoacoustic research 
>must be viewed as separate from larger musical and perceptual questions. 
>Because current psychoacoustic experiments focus on questions of sensory 
>perception, there remains a dichotomy between what Easley Blackwood has 
>called "concordance and discordance" and sensory consonance and 
>dissonance. In fact sensory consonance is a misnomer: the effects are more 
>accurately described as sensations of auditory roughness or smoothness.
>Depending on the tuning or the composition, intervals which are perceived 
>as rough may prove concordant, while intervals which prdouce the auditory 
>sensation of smoothness may strike the listener as discordant--that is, out 
>of place musically.  In Western music, the best example of this phenomenon 
>is the perfect fourth, which sounds acoutically smoother than the major 
>third but which by itself generally constitutes an unstable and  musically 
>discordant interval.
>In Balinese and Javanese music, the best example is the stretched 1215-
>cent octave, which sounds acoustically rough but which produces as sense 
>of musical concordance when performed by a gamelan.
>The most striking example in my own experience was a 1990 concert by 
>the Women's National Chorus of Bulgaria. One of the duets (a folk song 
>from the Thracian plains) ended on a large major just second (9/8).  The 
>Western audience sat without moving forwhat seemed a long time: only 
>when the  singers bowed did the audience realize the duet was over, and 
> applaud.  In  this case the contradiction between learned perceptions of 
>concordance and cadence, and the sensory perception of roughness in the 
>cadential intervals, prevented the audience from correctly perceiving the 
>cadence. 
>It is important not to confuse sensory roughness or smoothness, as 
>measured by psychoacoustical experiments, with higher-level perceptions 
>of musical consonance and dissonance. Many advocates of just intonation 
>have baselessly conflated the two categories, while advocates of Fetis' 
>model (viz., all auditory responses are predominately learned responses) 
>excessively emphasize the abstract levels of hierarchical auditory 
>perception while unjustifiably discounting the purely physical processes at 
>work in the human ear/brain system--in particular the frequency-analysis 
>operations of the basilar membrane and the periodicity-extraction 
>mechanism of the neurons in the auditory nerve. 
>Ultimately, what Zwicker calls Gestalt musical perception is mediated not 
>only by the physics and acoustics of the inner ear, but also by primary, 
>secondary, third-order and fourth-order neurons, a variety of different 
>brain locations, and the operant conditioning imposed by experience, culture 
>and  musical tradition.  The conclusions of this series of posts must be 
>taken in that context, and understood in that larger framework.
