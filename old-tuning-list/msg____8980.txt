Subject: Comments on managing the tuning list

From: Mark Nowitzky <nowitzky@alum.mit.edu>

Hi all,

Just letting you know that it's an honor, and I'm having a blast, managing
the tuning list at its new location.  It's quite an undertaking; increased
thanks to Dave Madole for managing it for all that time!

Anyway, here's some common problems, and how to deal with them.

1)  Too many messages per day - I want just one, daily email:

For those of you who preferred receiving the list in one, daily "digest" (as
I do), you
need to switch your subscription to digest mode, by sending an empty email
to "tuning-digest@onelist.com".

It's too bad I wasn't able to capture everybody's "digest vs. non-digest"
preferences from the old system, 'cuz it seems to be a common problem.

2)  "When I try to switch to digest, or even mail to the list at all, I am
told that my email address is not subscribed.  And yet I receive tuning
email here.":

You may be known to the system by a different email address.  The difference
may be subtle, or there may be some sort of "email forwarding" going on.
Compare the return address you put on emails to the address ONElist is using
to send you mail.

3)  Do I have to have web access to use this thing now?

No.  I saw this problem coming.  That's why I included this extra
description in every message, after ONElist's web instructions:

  You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through
  email.  Send an empty email to one of these addresses:
    tuning-subscribe@onelist.com - subscribe to the tuning list.
    tuning-unsubscribe@onelist.com - unsubscribe from the tuning list.
    tuning-digest@onelist.com - switch your subscription to digest mode.
    tuning-normal@onelist.com - switch your subscription to normal mode.

That's all for now.  Go back to talking about tuning.  (Maybe I'll join in
on that again too, once the smoke settles.)  Thanks,

--Mark
