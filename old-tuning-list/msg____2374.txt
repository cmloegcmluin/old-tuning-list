Subject: RE: more Bach

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Gary is right to question why I tied improvisation to microtonality in 
Bach.  Let me try some examples of implied Bach microtonality.

Bach's virtuoso use of the piccolo trumpet which had no pistons and is 
rarely if ever used in modern performances was using higher number just 
relationships.

Bach's favorite keyboard was reputed to be the clavichord, even though he 
was known widely as an organist and wrote for harpsichord, and never as a 
pianist.  The clavichord Bewebungen changes pitch discreetly by the 
weight of the hand.

Since each keyboard was tuned differently in a variety of temperaments, 
Bach would need to have an especially flexible intonation schemata for 
his fertile imagination to be realized.  Not only was there no concept of 
absolute pitch, there was a dualistic "chamber" and "church" pitch 
usually about a whole tone apart. Since equal temperament was "unnatural" 
to the ear in the sense that it is tuned by in the present day by 
outsiders, tuners.  

Bach would tune a harpsichord in 15 minutes.  No interval could be given 
with authority to a musician unless he gave it.  To write music that 
would favor the most advanced temperament schemes, and yet be fully 
functional and aesthetically pleasing in alternatives and variations, 
combined with the knowledge of his prowess in improvising to the point of 
musical duels, leads me to believe that he was a great micrtonalist indeed.

He has the most microtonal title of any established composer (The 
Well-tempered Clavier).  His Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue takes full 
advantage of the best that Werckmeister III has to offer, and he replaced 
to pitch-restricted viola da gamba with the fretless cello.

Gary, ultimately it's an intuitive thing, that to imagine as an 
improvisor as must have would require the greatest of microtonal minds to 
navigate at such a level of distinction.
