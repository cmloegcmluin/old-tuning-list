Subject: Format problems with Brian's Posts

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Brian's last Psychoacoustics post, 21/25, arrived badly garbled in 
Tuning Digest 530, so I am posting a re-formatted copy. Apparently when
his word processor wraps a long line, the line gets truncated somewhere 
in the chain of systems it passes through. Unfortunately, it usually
looks complete on my screen, so only if I pass his text through my word
processor, insert a CR at the end of every line, then save it again as 
an ascii file, can I be assured that it will be legible. This takes some 
time and I have been loath to do it. Anyway, I hope this version is 
readable.
