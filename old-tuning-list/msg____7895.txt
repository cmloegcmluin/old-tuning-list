So,the MR series resolution is good enough that one might, in all 
probability ,never wish for more ?

BTW,please ignore that rubbish in that post about "psychoacoustic efx" 
blah-blah.Just thinking aloud.Could've kicked myself for forgetting to 
delete it from the message.

Also there is another alternative: MSP,the real-time synthesis software 
that works on top of Max.
It uses Hertz.<www.cycling74.com> Also distributed by IRCAM.

John (Loffink),thanks for the Yamaha FM info,but drat..... 
And you should get MSP onto you website.
