Yes, I certainly understated the matter when I called
it simply amusing -- but I was thinking along the lines
of experimenters producing the results they're looking
for by not setting up their experiment properly or by
assuming more than they should as "constants", thus giving
their entire experiment a bias which renders its outcome
invalid.

Viewed in this light, I think their report could be
characterized as disturbing.
