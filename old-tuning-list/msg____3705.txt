South Dakota comment:

I grew up in S. Dak.  --  it's all that singing with cows (during the day)
and coyotes (at night) that develop the microtonality in the northern
plains!  (There's probably more truth to this than just another tale....)

Kudos to Anthony Lis for encouraging this with his students (we worked
together in the S.D. Composers Forum years back).  Allen Strange and I
are likewise introducing so-called microtonal concepts to our 1st-semester
music systems class (no longer called "theory"); those students who are
aware of their world have no problem with these issues (alas, those
students who are among the walking comotose do not get it.....but then
they are not getting Mozart's sevenths resolving down by step either).
