Brian,

Perhaps the double space reveals the fact that Brian you the word "normally" 
between "not" and "present." Didn't I qualify this to say that apparant 
subharmonics can result when a note is itself a harmonic, i.e., all notes on 
brass instruments? You're right though, I haven't done any actual fourier 
analysis of musical instruments. I've done lost of fourier analysis, though, 
like transforming from position space to momentum space on quantum mechanics 
exams. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle results from the fact that the 
fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian.

As for factual errors, your post on meantone tuning was full of 'em. One 
Tuning Digest consisted entirely of my slam of that post. Care to reply?

If I am expected to get your CPS/SCALA joke, surely it is not unreasonable 
for me to expect you to take my critical comments with a sense of humor, or 
for someone else to compare you with their antisemitic uncle without fearing 
a libel charge.

Peace, Love, and Music,
Paul
