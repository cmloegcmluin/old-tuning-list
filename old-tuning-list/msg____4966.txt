I think it is a mistake to draw this conclusion from the term
"wohltemperirt" in the title. The meaning is far from clearly defined.
It's a rather uncommon term; there may only be two theoreticians in
the 17th and 18th century who used it: Werckmeister and Sorge. At
first it's used in a loose way by Werckmeister, meaning only "well
tempered" or "well tuned". Later he uses it to denote a class of
tunings with which can be played in all keys and which contains no
wolf intervals. Sorge's interpretation is virtually the same.
Therefore it can mean either equal or unequal temperament. Noteworthy
is also that they spelled "wohl temperirt". 
A debate on this issue has been on this list in the past however, which
I don't want to restart. But I do have doubts.
