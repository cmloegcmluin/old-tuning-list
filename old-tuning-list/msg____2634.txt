Back in January there was an open house. I was there for 
2 1/2 hours asking Dean questions and 3 other people showed 
up for a few min. He told me there will be a performance on 3/24, 
three to five or six pm at SUNY. I would give you the number of 
the studio, but I don't know what I did with it. I'll look tonight. If I find
it, 
I'll post it.

exhibition,

Partch's
>"Castor and Pollux." Does anyone know if this CD has been released yet?

I asked Dean about this and he said not yet. But then that was in Jan.
