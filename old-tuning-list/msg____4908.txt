I think you misunderstand this. The soundboard itself is here only a
transmitter - whose surface area is receiving the sound from the air.  Try
the reverse of what you describe - hold the soundboard firmly (I assume you
haven't got an instrument from Cremona) so that it cannot vibrate. Sing
into the back of the violin. The sympathetic motion should be minimal.
