From: John_Gzowski@goodmedia.com (John Gzowski)

Hello tuning enthusiasts

It sounded like the right time to join in the discussion, after the
invitation from Johnny Reinhard.
I am a performing musician/composer/instrument builder in Toronto. I have
studied with Paul Rapoport and James Tenney and done some of my own research.
I came into this as a guitar player who was always frustrated with the sound
of 12 tet. I've built a 19 tet guitar, a 50 stringed instrument (10 played,
40 sympathetic) with the Rankin fretboard system, a primitive electric cello,
retuned an accordion to 19tet and built a 12 foot long stringed instrument
for harmonics (with 8 strings it produces most of the Monophonic ratios). I
have played in a Gamelan group, played oud in an Arabic/Greek ensemble and a
Eastern European gypsy group. Lately 31tet has been my favourite. I have been
subscribing for a few months now but have been more concerned with
playing/writing/learning than replying. But what the heck, I do have two
things to add.

1)  Critical Band ( a group I am presently leading) is presenting a concert
Dec. 14, '96 at the Music Gallery, Toronto, Ont., Canada. On the bill will be
works by me, a selection of Partch's Li Po settings and works by Johnny
Reinhard (who is coming up for the concert) and by other members in the
group, Garnet Willis (instrument builder/composer) and Marc Sabat
(violin/adapted viola). We will be doing works in Just and 31 tet, maybe
other tunigs as well.

2) Reply to Daniel Wolf. I have built a few pickups, but don't know enough to
put out a pamphlet. However to make magnetic pickups all you need are
lacquered magnet wire (or speaker wire) a magnet and a bobbin. I've used #44 
wire(I think, I'll have to check on that) and a power drill on low speed to
wind the wire around a screw , then attached a strong magnet to it (which
magnetizes the screw). The pickups I made are low output and very small,
specific to an instrument of mine. I used somewhere around 5000-10000 winds,
but I think most guitar pickups use less. You could also contact
McDonald/Stewart (talk to a nearby music store with a repair department they
could show you catalogs) they stock a wide variety of pickups for different
instruments and one of them may be usable.
