You might do it in Hz, or, if triggered via MIDI, simply as note numbers,
or, if on paper or screen, as vertical positions, etc. Color is a 
non-repeating parameter, yet painters seem able to handle it. In a way, 
repeating systems could be considered awkward in that you have paradoxically 
simultaneous difference and sameness which must be kept track of.

For my someday pan-pitch sequencer, I intend to represent pitch vertically 
allowing continuous vertical placement and having no guidelines, or 
user-definable guidelines, relying instead on audible feedback as notes 
are placed in the score and moved to tune. I suspect that hand/eye/ear 
coordination would adapt to this, and the software would become a sort 
of score-becomes-instrument. I see no reason to keep the old ideas of 
note names, etc. when composing electronically using the entire pitch 
spectrum as a resource.
