Subject: 7-limit harmony articles

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

I am currently researching the inclusion of chords with simple 7-limit intervals
into late Romantic and jazz harmony in 19, 22, and 31-ETs <and maybe others>.I
am interested in problems like:

While the 4/5/6/7 sounds like a purer Mm7, how does the presence of a good 7/4
approximation alter its functionality in the >12-ETs? 

I also plan to examine the use of some 11-limit intervals, and the beating
unison heard with the harmony of the chromatic interval in the >= 22-ETs. I may
also examine Vicentinos raised dominants in the Enharmonic Madrigals.

I would like to know if I am missing any significant source material for this. I
am primarily seeking theoretical writings, but would also appreciate scores and
recordings.

Within my personal library, or available at nearby universities, I have access
to the following relevant or semi-relevant sources:

--the Blackwood Etudes CD and scores
--Blackwoods The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings
--Blackwoods articles in Perspectives of New Music
--Fokkers New Music in 31-Tones
--<<Unison vectors...>> and <<Just Intonation...>> by Fokker
--The Just Intonation Primer by David Doty
--Mandelbaums dissertation
--Xenharmonikon issue 7+8
--Partchs Genesis
--Vicentinos Enharmonic Madrigals

Am I missing anything important?

Thanks for any help you can offer.
