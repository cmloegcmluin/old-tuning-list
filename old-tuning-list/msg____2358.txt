Subject: Re: 88CET Demo Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Sorry to keep bugging everybody about my 88CET demo.  

   Linus Liu pointed out that I probably confused people about it when I babbled
on about my DAT deck.  I mentioned my DAT deck because it was in the shop for
over a month and the master of the demo is on DAT.  

   I mentioned my DAT deck only to make excuses for why I hadn't filled the
orders for a month, not to imply that you need a DAT deck to hear the demo.  You
don't; the copies are on ordinary dolby-B cassettes.  

   Sorry for the confusion.
