I am sure that they are ETs. Don't forget that JI scales require
dog-legged frets. Last night I was playing heavy-metal style on my
guitar (the 7-string Ibanez, which Vai designed, refretted to 22tET).
I'm sure Steve would be proud. I actually find it easier to play random
runs with the microtonal fretting.
