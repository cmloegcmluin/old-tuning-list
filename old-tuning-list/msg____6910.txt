I've noticed that melodies and harmonies don't necessarily have to share
the same scales.  When I studied with Ben Johnston, it was an assumption
that all pitches needed for harmony and melody would be part of the same
set.  I now questions that.

As an example, let us take the tune "Amazing Grace" which is itself
pentatonic.  it came be harmonized by confining oneself to the pentatonic
pitches (anything pretty much goes), or by using other scales.  For
example, in most hymnbooks, it is harmonized in diatonic harmony, which
requires the 4th and 7th scale degrees.  In Ben's variations, he goes
further along, harmonizing it with 7th partial relationships (and 11th, if
I recall correctly.)  The piece works, I think! <G>

I see no reason why the pitches used for melodic material need to be the
same as those used for harmony.  Actually, for anyone who has played with
scales in just intonation, it is obvious that the second scale degree
(let's call it 'Re') which is a perfect fifth above 'Soh' is not the same
note as the one that is a minor third below 'Fa.'  And it is also true
that there are two 'Fa's: the one that is a perfect fifth below 'Doh', and
the one that is a minor seventh above 'Soh.'

Of course, in equal temperament, we just sort of average out the
differences, but if we really want to play in tune, then we need more
notes than are in a diatonic scale.
