Thanks for the kind words. I have so many ideas that some of them have
to be right.

I don't think there's much danger of 19-tone tyrannizing over music any
time soon, given the immense problems in the way of redesigning
instruments, etc and the inertia of the music world.

 Still, I honestly think the 12-tone equal will continue its miserable
progress unless someone finds some alternate 'tyranny'. Think of it as
giving an American president dictatorial powers so he can fight a Hitler
or a Stalin.

Also, I've noticed that quite a few of the microtonalists get very
uneasy if someone points out the rather evident deficiencies of 12-tone
equal - apparently they want to be very daring and all, and play around
with something that makes the dog howl like 13-tone equal or whatever,
but when the crunch comes, it's back to the aweful, beloved 12 tones. My
favorite example is that theorist - who shall be nameless - who examined
hundreds of equal temperaments, then twisted himself into knots to find
some mathematical wil-o'-the-wisp (the 45th partial or whatever) that
would let him triumphantly announce that 12-tone equal was amazingly
special after all!

You are right that rock music uses all kinds of intonations. But I have
been able to notate the rock melodies I hear much better in 19-tone than
in any other system I've tried. Not that I've notated hundreds of them
or anything - life just isn't long enough to do everything I ought to
do.

It always annoys me when I see some piece of non-Western vocal music
notated in 12-tone equal - I _know_ the result is just a travesty of the
original.
