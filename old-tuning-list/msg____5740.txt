Subject: Interpreting the work of others

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Before I get to the point, please let me direct those of you with 
web browsers to Jeff Harrington's page at

http://www.parnasse.com/jeff.htm

What a page! it's loaded with music in 
many different formats including 
Shockwave, MIDI and .au formats, and a 
lot of it is microtonal. Some of this 
is excellent!

	Recently I linked to one of Kami 
Rousseau's bits, a reworking of a 
rather standard 12TET chord progression in 
15TET. It was familiar and yet totally strange- familiar because you 
could tell what was being done, and strange because the standard chord 
progression didn't end up where you would expect it to. This sort of 
thing is hilarious to me...it reminds me of the fun 
Neil Haverstick and I used to have 
when we were backing up a country & 
western Elvis imitator a few years 
ago, quoting various classical and pop 
fragments out of context as riffs and 
vamps in standard Elvis arrangements.                                       
We would try to outdo each other at placing inappropriate segments in the 
music. I don't know what Elvis would have thought (Gene, our boss, 
sometimes wanted to strangle us) but all the musicians who came to hear 
us loved it. 

WERE WE RUINING THE MUSIC??
It depends on your point of view. We were definitely making the music 
more interesting (to us and our friends, at least). 

	My point is, what constitutes a valid performance of another's 
work? In the 12TET world, we are not afraid to present standard repetoir 
in outrageous clothing, because everyone knows its a joke. We are not 
afraid to undertake a serious reworking of someone else's music, because 
our peers understand that we are trying to elaborate or strip down or 
whatever a piece that we think has merit.
	In the microtonal world, however, because of the unfamiliarity of 
the tonal materials, I think, not as much deviation is appropriate, as we 
may lose the meaning or structure of the original. 

What do you think? By what are we bound in the interpretation of another 
microtonalist's music?

I commenced to pondering this after reading the letter to the KRONOS 
string quartet (look in Corporeal Meadows) berating them for playing some of 
Partch's music on "unauthorized" instruments. Hell, John Schneider plays 
Partch on his guitar and doesn't get slapped around (as far as I know). 
It seems to me that a sensitive arrangement of Partch for string quartet 
is entirely appropriate, as long as the tonality is respected.

p.s. Really, CHECK OUT THE JEFF HARRINGTON!
