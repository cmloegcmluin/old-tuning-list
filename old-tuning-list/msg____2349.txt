I would think that your best places to start in Just Intonation are David
Doty's book "The Just Intonation Primer", and R. David Hill's cassette
lecture/demo "Introduction to Nontraditional Harmony".  They are both available
from the Just Intonation Network's "Just Intonation Store".  

   According to the most recent flier I can find for them, they cost $8 for
Doty's book, and $20 for Hill's lecture/demo.  Also include 25% for postage.
Their address is 535 Stevenson Street;  San Francisco, CA 94103.  

   I confess that I haven't read Doty's book, but Hill's lecture/demo is just
faaaaantastic!  But I can't definitely say that I have heard no negative reports
about Doty's book, and at least three very positive ones.
