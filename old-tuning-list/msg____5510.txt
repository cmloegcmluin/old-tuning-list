- a remark which I cannot follow at all, unless one wishes to limit ''music
theory'' and ''practical music'' to what what happened in art music in
German-speaking countries (and even there (here, I should say)), there is
plenty of ''modal'' music to be found in both ''composed'' and folk
traditions.

Even if you intend to limit the definition of the church modes to their
treatment under species counterpoint, then you must account for the fact
that composing in various modes has been a continuous and central part of
musical training in the western classical tradition.  

That said, I believe it is worthwhile to discuss what aspects of modal
theory are indeed useful for a musical training in which a wider variety of
pitch relations are to be included. From my personal experience, I find it
more efficient for a beginner to concentrate on mastering (singing,
dictating, and tuning up) _intervals_, and then contructing collections of
pitches (among them tetrachords, hexachords, and proper scales) and only
then locating modes within the collections. I find too often that young
musicians focus on ''scales'' which are simply not directly relevant to a
lot of real musics. Most music that I know tends to focus locally on
collections smaller than scales (something I learned first by listening to
Stravinsky and Sibelius, but then reconfirmed in my ethnological work), and
music that makes even the most simple modulations will soon depart from the
limits of a single scale.  

(One caveat to the above: if the student is interested in learning a music
based upon a fixed drone pitch (as in Karnatic or Hindustani musics), then
one begins directly with the modes as fixed melodic types, each with fixed
ornamentation, and the abstract study of intervals is less relevant.)

In the west, the modal traditions are defined rather more coarsly than on
the Indian subcontinent, and modal melodic types are not fixed to
particular ornaments nor may they be assigned single intonations. Indeed,
the modes - like the genera of the classical tetrachords - are broadly
defined and invariant to specific tunings; and in polyphgonic settings may
indeed require a larger number of exact pitches. Perhaps it is most
efficient to retain a definition of the modes in terms of ''whole steps''
and ''half steps''?  From my experience it is centainly sufficient to limit
the practice to the four most common modes (dorian, phrygian, lydian, and
mixolydian), to focus on the tetrachords and hexachords from which they are
built, and precisely tuning the intervals within these smaller units. This
kind of practice should then also be sufficient for tonal repertoire as
well (by recombining the tetra- or hexachords).
