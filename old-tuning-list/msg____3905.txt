   I think Johnny's point is that if a note-head had, for example "-15" over it
(meaning that it is to be played fifteen cents flat of 12TET), you can whip out
a fingering variation that you have memorized to be roughly that much flat of
that note.  Once you know the 12TET fingerings, and any player of a given
instrument would, it wouldn't take much more effort to augment that knowledge
with a series of memorized cent variations.  

   That is far easier than performing from a 7th or 13th harmonic sort of
description, because with that you'd have think - in realtime, on the fly - "OK,
what's the root of this chord (that in itself is especially tough since any
realistic performance each performer will have PARTS, and not the whole
conductor's score)?  How does this note relate to that root?  How much flat is a
13th harmonic from the closest 12TET pitch?"  Or similarly, in 17TET say, "OK,
what's the tonic now?  Which scale step is this note relative to that tonic?
How much sharp or flat is that 17TET note from the 12TET value that my
instrument is designed to play?"  

   The cent values, as Johnny so aptly pointed out, are ideal prescriptive
notation, whereas the harmonic numbers or whatever, are ideal descriptive
notation.  Harmonic numbers on a JI conductor's score make it a whole lot easier
to figure out what effect is to be achieved, but they are very impractical to
work with in realtime on a performance basis.
