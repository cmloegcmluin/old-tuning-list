Subject: Tuning lattices

From: Mark Nowitzky <nowitzky@pacificnet.net>

Hi Graham (et al)!

Hope things are well "across the pond" in the UK.  Thanks again for your
input on matrices a few months back.  (We had exchanged emails about
visualizing chords by gluing toothpicks together, etc.)

I got a chance to see the "L.A. Microfest" last Sunday--Johnny Reinhard on
bassoon (and conducting), John Schneider on guitars, etc.  Pretty neat!

Anyway, I got inspired.  I'm thinking of revising the bottom of my web page
entitled "'The' Dominant Seventh Chord", by adding lattices for the samples,
=E0 la Your "Tuning Lattices".  Please see the rough draft, at:

Take care,
--Mark
