Check my posting. This is NOT what I said. My overall preference is for /7
/6 /5 /4, but in the next inversion, I prefer 10 12 15 17 to /6 /5 /4 2/7.

''The real test, Daniel, is to start with a just minor triad in sine waves,

and then, without looking at the numbers, and starting far away from the 
target pitch, try to tune a fourth sine wave to the /7 or 17 purely by ear.

If you can do the former with anywhere near the accuracy with which you can

do the latter, I'll eat my hat.''

As the folks here say: Guten appetit!

I tested all of this with my Rayna and a HP sine wave generator. I may be a
biased test subject, however, in that I have really ear trained though
ratios of 17. But this kind of bias is always a problem for me: what do you
really intend by ''prefer''?
