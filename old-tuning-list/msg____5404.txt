I am here; I read, or at least browse, the digest of the list daily. I
rarely post these days, because a) I'm very busy, and b) the same
discussions seem to repeat at about a six month cycle and I've already had
my say about most of them and don't care to repeat myself.

*The Just Intonation Primer* is published by the Just Intonation Network,
535 Stevenson Street, San Francisco CA 94103. It is free with a new
membership in the network (member pays shipping) or can be purchased for
$10.00 (the price went up with the most recent printing). More details can
be found at the JIN web site (see below).
