Subject: Re: tuning dictionary

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Adam Silverman had compiled a tuning dictionary with emphasis on JI for
the SEJIC (Southeast Just Intonation Center). He sent me a printout at
one point but I haven't heard anything since. I'm not sure if this is
available on the Web.

I would like to make a suggestion for the dictionary regarding the term
"limit". The term was coined by Harry Partch, whose use of it was not
entirely consistent. In certain contexts, he meant odd-limit, such as
when speaking about the 9-limit (obviously not a prime) and about
tonality diamonds. In other contexts, such as when speaking about tuning
systems, he meant the prime-limit. Most subsequent authors have adopted
the latter usage entirely, ignoring the utility of the former concept
for discussing consonance, etc. I simply suggest that the definition of
limit make this dichotomy clear so as to avoid further confusion.
