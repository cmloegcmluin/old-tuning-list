Subject: La Monte Young show web pages

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

There are Web-pages to the La Monte Young radio programme I announced 
earlier. Go to http://www.omroep.nl/nps/radio
and then follow the links to "NPS - Supplement" and "La Monte Young".
There are the programme notes, soundfragments, biography, discography
and work list of him and Marian Zazeela. These pages are in English.
