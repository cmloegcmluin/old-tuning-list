Paul,

I don't have any comments about these tunings, but I do have a question
about this:

>>In MT, the two German augmented sixth chords (usually Bb D F G# and Eb G Bb
>>C#) have a particularly concordant quality, resembling the seventh chords
>>sometimes encountered in barbershop singing. The two incomplete French
>>augmented sixth chords (Bb E G# and Eb A C#) also have a unique resonance.
>>Huygens, in advocating meantone tempermant, pointed out (back in the 17th
>>century, I believe) that these latter chords are used in compositions and in
>>meantone are tuned very nearly 1/7:1/5:1/4. This may have been the first
>>attempt to use the number 7 in explaining musical practice.

I haven't read Huygens (apart from what Barbour says about him), but this
seems a curious justification. Given that the minor seventh of the dominant
seventh chord resolves inward and the augmented sixth of the German
augmented sixth chord resolves outward, wouldn't one expect that, ideally,
the augmented sixth to be a larger interval than the minor seventh? (If,
indeed, one considers the seventh harmonic to be in need of resolution at
all.)
