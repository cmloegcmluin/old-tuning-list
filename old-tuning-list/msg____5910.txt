Subject: theories

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

You know, I've realized something because of a recent post I saw on
this forum. Somebody said that what's wrong with theorizing about
tunings; it's harming no one, so why can't they just do it and have folks
(like me) quit complaining...good question. So, I've now seen that one of
my problems with reading those posts is simply that I do NOT understand a
lot of the basic terms and how they're applied to music. I hear about,
and have done some reading about, tonality diamonds, stellated hexany's
and all, but I need to know what they are before I can feel like a
participant in those sorts of discussions. Yes, I am a player first, but
theory is vital to help folks keep inquiring and pushing forward. Some of
you folks are way out there with this stuff, and that's a compliment...I
would like to know more what's being discussed at times. Perhaps some of
you guys can talk about some of the basic concepts of advanced theory and
help bridge the gap that sometimes exists between the theorists and the
street folks like me. Of course, the math is a different story because
it's a whole language of concepts and symbols; I just do not have the
time to get real heavy into it, and I know many others who feel the same
way...still, I believe the basic idea of math, which seems to be
explaining the Universe in terms of various numerical balances of sorts,
is not so hard to see. I have the greatest respect for the  amazing minds
I've encountered on this forum...I cannot always keep up on the theory
end, but I'd like to know more of what you're talking about...Hstick
