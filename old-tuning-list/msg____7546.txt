   I personally agree that the "clean" feeling of JI is best appreciated
with long, sustained chords.  But even still, I personally have found that
you don't have to hear given harmonies in long sustained tones to notice
their tuning character.  Even if you play them each for a short duration,
you can perceive a cummulative character to them provided that you play
enough of those short chords.
