Subject: NTR (Not Tuning-Related):  AOL Questions

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Sorry to bug my fellow listers with not purely tuning-related mail, but
I have three questions for any of you who are on AOL:
1.  Does the Mac version of AOL software provide a web browser
(CompuServe's 
    STILL doesn't, although they're close to providing it)?
2.  Does AOL provide any personal web-page space in their $20/month price?
3.  Does AOL's (Mac) software allow you to relocate your E-mail inbox in a 
    different place on your disk hierarchy?  (That is, it presumably has a
    default place for putting incoming and outgoing mail, but does it allow

    you put them elsewhere if you'd prefer?)

   Please respond to me personally (not to the list) to keep the non-tuning
messages down.  Thanks!
