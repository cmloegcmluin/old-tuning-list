Subject: Microtone

From: hajdu@uni-muenster.de (Georg Hajdu)

I have uploaded an updated MAX patch named "microtone" to the following sites:

128.255.208.37
ella.mills.edu
(I also tried the IRCAM server in vain.)

microtone is a MAX notation patch that uses the Finale Tamburo font to
display microtonal music in real-time.

For further information I am including a modified version of the "about"
subpatch that's part of microtone (there's also a manual included in the
self-extracting archive file "microtone.sea.hqx"):

max v2;
#N vpatcher 5 40 626 398;
#P hidden inlet 1 -15 15 0;
#P comment 30 106 561 1048588 The chords can be displayed in virtually
every notational system: standard 12-note system or user-defined systems.
µtone uses the Finale Tamburo font containing a set of accidentals that can
be used for the notation of microtonal tuning systems. If loudness
information is provided \, the dynamic of the individual pitches will be
displayed as well.;
#P comment 30 46 561 1048588 µtone - is a MAX patch that allows the user to
display notes and chords in musical notation. You can enter data using
three different units of measurement for pitch and loudness (Hz \,
Midicents \, Key Numbers or Amplitude \, dB \, Key Velocity \, resp.). For
this \, you can choose the appropriate unit from the special input menu.;
#P comment 30 169 561 1048588 The four inputs to µtone are: 1. pitch \, 2.
loudness \, 3. a comment and 4. slot number (of the chord on the display).
The maximum number of slots can be set with the "sectors" option in
"Settings". Copy the modified Finale Screen Fonts suitcase into the fonts
folder inside the system folder before you load µtone. You can also display
pitches on screen by pointing and clicking while holding a number key. The
numbers 1 through 8 correspond to the 8 eighth-tone accidentals in
increasing order.;
#P comment 30 243 561 1048588 You can toggle between the special menu and
the MAX menu by pressing "m" (special menu) or "n" (MAX menu). Use the
space bar to refresh the screen or the return key to clear the window.;
