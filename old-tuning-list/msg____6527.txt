Way back in 1974, when I was a freshman at Brigham Young University, the
staff piano tuner tuned two 'identical' haprsichords (Neupert!) - one in
EQ, and the other in a well-tempered system (I believe it was Kirnberger
II).  Then, we listened to WTC Prelude #1 in C Major.  I was astonished at
the difference!  To me,the relative stability/instability of chords
provided an interest level comparable to the interest level that dynamics
provide on a piano.  In other words, playing these works in EQ is, to me,
akin to playing Beethoven with one dynamic level.

Most good harpsichord recordings made in the past twenty years or so will
use some sort of well-temperament.  (Likewise, the most of today's best
organ builders do not use EQ.)
