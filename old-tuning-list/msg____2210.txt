Subject: RE: E-mu sysex tuning tables?

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

To Paul Fly,
If it's true that the E-mu Morpheus tunes the same way as the E-mu 
Proteus, it's not difficult to calculate the tuning numbers for it.
The resolution is 768 steps per octave, so to obtain the number,
take the base-2 logarithm of the frequency ratio, multiply by 768 and 
round to the nearest integer. The tuning number for middle-C of 
261.6 Hz is 3840. So a pure fifth above middle-C gets
3840 + [ 768 * 2log 1.5 ] = 4289.
The tuning program that I'm currently writing can print out tables of
these numbers for different synthesizers. Until it is ready I could
send you some via e-mail for scales you wish to explore. 
You could do me a favour by looking up in the manual the instrument
number that goes in system-exclusive messages, and/or find out what 
the message format is for tuning dumps. That way I can have the 
program send tuning dumps for the Morpheus and write them to
MIDI-files. If you are able to download a MIDI-file you could help me
test this.
