Subject: Web page, Get together

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

I would like to invite you all to check my homepage,
http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/

I wrote MIDI files that demonstrate the chromatic scale, trill and chord (up
to the "13th OTonal chord"). I know that the "melody line" of each .mid is
repetitive, but I had to keep it that way, to change only one variable. The
whole point is to compare the sound, or mood, of each scales. I did not try
to show you which chord is best to harmonize a nTET melody, I wanted to show
you how each scale approximates members of the harmonic serie. The scales
are all ET's (for now), from 1TET to 21TET. I will post a notice on the list
when I write another lot. I intend to write all ET's up to 48, and will
accept your suggestions for any 'typical' just or njnet scale. If you think
you can help me improve the structure or content of each files, or if you
find errors, email me.

I would like to organize a GT for the North England region. All we hear
about on the list is Brian McLaren this, Brian that. He is a brilliant
musician, but he is the only one who talks! (this is exagerated, but you get
the point. We should all be posting to the list.) I'm 19/m, I live in
Quebec, I think the best place to meet would be Albany, NY. Anyway, all
those interested should send me a email, stating where you live and your
disponibilities for July-August 96. I will try to triangulate the* best
place for all of us. It will be up the person living closest to this meeting
point to find us a place to meet (a restaurant, whatever).
