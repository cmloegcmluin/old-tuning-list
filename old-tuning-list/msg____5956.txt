You're right that periodicity would depend on the system being autonomous.
I suspect we're having some terminological confusion here. I studied physics
once upon a time but that was a long time ago. Somehow we need to
distinguish between ordinary differential equations and partial differential
equations for starters. What I mean by a system with one degree of freedom is
something like a simple pendulum.

Once we get into the wave equation, to me that's a partial differential
equation. That describes a system like a vibrating string, that has roughly
an infinite number of degrees of freedom - i.e. each little section of the
string can be budged up or down a smidgeon independently of how much other
little sections are budged, though of course the elastic forces acting on the
various little sections depend precisely on all those budgements.

Another factor coming into play could be the order of the various
differential equations. E.g. harmonic oscillators are second order
differential equations, because acceleration is the second time derivative of
position.

So it's my turn to be confused. An ideal string can certainly have periodic
motion. Actually any vibrating body will have a whole set of modes of
oscillation, and if you get the body to vibrate in just one mode, then its
motion will be periodic. That's what modes of oscillation are, roughly
speaking. (A little more precisely, the periodic motion will be follow a nice
sinewave shape).

I suspect we're just getting caught by words like "one dimensional
continuous".

I'm not sure just how much physics is really appropriate in this forum. But
it seems worthwhile to try to clarify:

Integer ratio overtones can come from other mechanisms besides uniform and
elastic etc.

If you take a nice clean laboratory sinewave oscillator and run it through an
amplifier and through a loud speaker and CRANK THE VOLUME WAY UP it won't be
a nice clean sinewave any more. The distortion of the loudspeak, amplifier,
etc. will generate nice integer ratio overtones! No vibrating strings around.

I'm not sure if this is related to the one-degree-of-freedom business or
not. But periodic motion necessarily generates integer-ratio overtones, and
systems with one degree of freedom are more or less forced to be periodic -
as long as they're autonomous and probably some other restrictions, this gets
over my head pretty fast.

Anyway it seems like integer-ratio overtones are important to tuning theory
so maybe not too much of a waste of bandwidth to try to get clear.
