VI     II     V      I

This is the chord progression I've used, in 15TET. For your information, it
is the tuning that has the largest wandering tonic, 80 cents. When I first
started to explore this tuning, the only documentation I had was
Blackwood's chord progressions.

 I discovered this wandering tonic by accident, while I was writing ii V7 I
progressions in various tunings (7TET, 12TET, 18TET and 22TET). By the way,
the 22TET version sounds has a very powerful sound. I can send a short .mid
with the I IV V I in 22TET (staying on the same tonic) to anyone
interested. 

After thinking for a certain time, I found a melody that was harmonised
using only ii V7 I. You've probably heard it, it was last week's microtonal
midi moment. Of course, I've used this new musical effect to the limit. I
do not want to start a musical revolution, I am just exploring. 

BTW, I am not deaf, I can hear the very "special" sound that my music has.
It feels like you don't end up where you're supposed to. It took me a short
while to get used to this new sound. It is understandable that people
repudiate music whose basic structure is complex. The fact that music that
sounds too normal won't be noticed is also generaly accepted.

The problem is that I am now somewhere in between. If, in the back of your
mind, you do not believe that valuable music can be composed using
wandering tonics, your perception of the tonic will stay at the 1/1, and
when it goes down 80 cents, you will feel uncomfortable. But if you have
enough fate to accept the descending of the tonic, the wandering will
become natural, and it is  normal music will make you feel a little
uncomfortable, because it will sound "too static".

Now, maybe you think that I am crazy. The same musical could be applied in
22TET, and be more "digestible", or more subtile. But 22 does not seem like
a challenge to me (for the time being), and I choose to dwelve in this new
unexplored territory, to "boldly go where no one has gone before", where
tonality is eternaly moving. (There are many other resources, I'll write
about them later.)
