   I think it's very important for us to realize that we've been discussing
three fundamentally different types of topics here:
1.  Things that we know about.
2.  Speculations about unknown relationships between things that we know
about to 
    other things.
3.  Things that are irrelevant to science in the first place.  

   Electromagnetic waves are an example of the first.  Electromagnetic
waves are no more mysterious than E-mail.  As with sound waves, everything
about them - their frequency, amplitude, and waveform - can be precisely
quantified and measured.  The are a quite simple physical phenomenon as
natural as a rock falling when you drop it.  

   An example of the second is the possibility of as-yet-unknown medical or
psychological effects of electromagnetic waves.  Since one of these two
things, the electromagnetic waves, are scientifically well-understood,
possible correlations can be located scientifically.  It makes no sense,
however, to speculate about such correlations mystically.  If I were to say
that on my way to work this morning I had an overwhelming deja vu
experience, what value could possibly come from also suggesting that this
was caused by an electromagnetic phenomenon?  That's irrelevant to the
topic at hand, which is the freaky sensation of that experience, and could
mislead people about the nature of Electromagnetics.  

   The third general sort of topic we've discussed are mystical, religious,
and metaphysical.  Whether God has set me on a personal quest to bring new
musical resources to the public and other composers is irrelevant of the
precise reason why xylophone bars vibrate with nonharmonic partials. 
Divine influence has no precisely quantifiable basis (and if you'll pardon
the pun I'll add "Thank God!"), so electromagnetic waves also have nothing
to do with it.

   By no means am I suggesting that imply that mystical ideas are
unimportant, or meaningless.  In fact, when we're on our death beds, many
of us will conclude that they are the ONLY meaningful ideas.  They're just
not of much concern to science, nor is science of much concern to
mysticism.  They contribute very little to each other.
