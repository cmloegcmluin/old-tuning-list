Subject: Bartok research

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Just listening to Bartok this morning, and got to thinking...he did a 
lot of research into Hungarian, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern folk 
music, cataloging thousands of tunes...are the results of this research 
published? Is it available for purchase? Did he talk about the tunings in 
any depth? Of course, he used "microtones" occasionally, so he was 
obviously hip to the concept...I would like to know more about this area 
of his life, so if anyone has any info, let me know...also, the forum CD 
master DAT is done, I'll pick it up real soon...Hstick
