I can understand how this change enforced a 12-pitch-per-octave standard
keyboard, but pianos are hand-tuned, even now. The construction of a piano
does not have to be changed to accomodate most historical meantone, just,
or well-tempered tunings, as long as they don't stray radically from a
12TET median. Granted, modern high-tension piano strings cannot be safely
sharpened more than a semitone or so (unlike low-tension harpsichords), but
the difference between 12TET pitches and those of these other tunings is
usually no more than about 20 cents. In fact, given that, without
electronic help, 12TET is generally much more time-consuming to tune than
1/4-meantone (to take an obvious example), one would think that the
capitalist piano manufacturers would have *avoided* it.
