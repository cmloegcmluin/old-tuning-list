   Gosh, once you work your way past Brian's indiginously over-colorful language
tendencies, I think you'll find that all he's saying is that there's room for
improvement in the situation, and offering suggestions for the nature of that
improvement.  

   And it was pretty obvious to me at least that he didn't expect any of us to
rewrite any of the search engines he tried.
