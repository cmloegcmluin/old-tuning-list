Subject: Olle Mustafson

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	A number of years ago I heard an audition tape on Karl Haas' show 
by a 19 year old Finnish composer named Olle Mustafson. I may have the 
spelling of the name wrong, but if any of you on the list know of this 
fellow, I would appreciate you letting me know.
