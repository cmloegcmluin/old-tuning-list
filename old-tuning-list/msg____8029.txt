An interval vanishes in a particular ET (or quasi-ET like a
well-temperament) if it is represented by 0 scale degrees.  In face, to
specify which intervals vanish is a fairly practical way to specify a
particular system.  See Fokker's writings for this.

As an example: working in the 3-5 harmonic lattice, deciding that one
wants the syntonic comma 81/80 and the lesser diesis 128/125 to vanish
commits one to working in a 12-ish system.  Conveniently, one can
represent this (as Graham Breed has posted before, following Fokker)
with matrices: the 81/80 is represented by the vector (4 -1) (3 ^ 4 *
5 ^ -1, omitting 2s) and the lesser diesis by (0 3).  Put the vectors
together to form a matrix, and the determinant of the matrix is (4 * 3 -
-1 * 0), or 12.  This also works in higher dimensions.

Geometrically, one can imagine the unison vectors (Fokker's terminology)
specifying a way to collapse the infinite harmonic plane into a
2-manifold.  The number of pitches in the ET is the area of the
parallelogram bounded by the unison vectors, or the "real" size of the
manifold--I forget what the formal mathematical term for that is.  (This
also extends to higher dimensions, with parallelepipeds etc.)
