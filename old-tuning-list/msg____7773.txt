Dude.  You're doing that thing again where you switch examples on me.  The
original one is about a difference of 22 cents.  Now this one is about
differences of .2 cents.  The original was 3 vs. 5 limit- this one about 13
vs. 41 limit.

I said on two occasions that the ness's fall off the more times you stack
an interval, especially when the stacking brings one interval close in size
to another.  But I said that the 81/64 was not close enough to the 5/4 to
erase the 3 for me, and this is true, and no tricky example will allow me
to hear otherwise.

I said on one occasion that the nesses probably come in different strengths
at different limits.  So far, I can only identify a ness up to 11 (it's
dangerous and tropical), but I'm still weak on it; I only have a firm feel
up to 7 (and that's all I listed in my original ness list).  And tho I
can't hear a 17-ness, I don't dis-believe in it.  I just say it's outside
my experience.

Lastly, I wonder if you'd care try this example using odd limits.

Carl
