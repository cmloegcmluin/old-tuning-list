The effect of a subharmonic complex of sine waves seems to me to be 
undistinguished in any respect. The combination tones will fill the entire 
pitch spectrum, leading to lots of roughness and very little tonalness (or 
tonal fusion), while the combination tones of a harmonic complex of sine 
waves will form a single harmonic series, a very distinguished and 
digestible sensation. It is only with the addition of harmonic spectra that 
subharmonic chords become distinguished in any psychoacoustical way from 
their immediate neighbors in n-1 dimensional pitch space.

Could you elaborate on this idea?

In a compositional sense, your characterization may be useful, but in a 
purely psychoacoustical sense, a chord played will evoke certain 
interpretations in terms of the harmonic series. This is what my algorithm 
tells you, and the results are most interesting when applied to 
temperaments. Are you still interested in evaluating this algorithm?

Of course, the only one that will work on paper is the pythagorean, but in 
equal temperament, you can do it, too! The ear doesn't continue its harmonic 
series math from one chord to the next; it doesn't know that 19 is not 
factorable by 3 or whatever. The ear doesn't follow the calculations through 
and say, "Ah, although the tonic is the same pitch as before, it is now 
represented by a different number, so something must have been wrong with my 
calculations -- let me go back and correct them." The issue of "puns" cannot 
be avoided, since even a pythagorean minor triad will be heard, under 
certain circumstances, as a 16:19:24, and never as 54:64:81 -- the ear's 
central pitch processor simply doesn't go that far. 16:19:24 which is 
subltely more tonal (rooted) a sound than 10:12:15, and that does make a 
musical difference (I didn't say "no musical difference" -- indeed I 
postulated a stylistic change in Western music that could be attributable to 
this very difference). The reason the difference is subtle is that the main 
impression made by these minor triads on the central pitch processor is that 
of a perfect fifth with an added non-harmonic note. Of these minor triads, 
the 10:12:15 may minimize roughness, but that is a seperable issue, I 
believe. This is what I meant by interpretation -- not what you put down on 
paper, but how the brain's central pitch processor understands the sound.

>(4) From this pitch spacing perspective, the "optimal frequency range" may

Actually, these are two seperate concepts, and a register-specific theory 
would have to take _both_ into account. My algorithm is indeed derived by 
first identifying this lower limit, and then allowing it to approach zero 
(since the algorithm is to be register-unspecific). The pitch resolution of 
the central pitch processor as a function of frequency would also have to be 
taken into account by a register-specific theory. If the audible partials of 
a chord fall into the optimal frequency range (the range where the pitch 
resolution is greatest), the chord will be interpreted most accurately -- 
otherwise, the ear will resort to interpretations in terms of lower members 
of the harmonic series.

I didn't take your quantum business seriously; controversy is not the word.
