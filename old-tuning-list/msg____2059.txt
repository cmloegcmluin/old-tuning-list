1996 International Computer Music Conference

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the Hong Kong Urban 
Council will host the International Computer Music Conference from

celebrating Hong Kong's cultural environment "on the edge" between Asia 
and the West.  

The conference organizers seek installation pieces with computer for a 
"Garden of Sound" taking advantage of indoor and outdoor spaces in the
university's beautiful architecture overlooking the Pacific ocean.  
Artists intending to submit proposals for installation pieces 
are urged to request special information regarding the available spaces 
to facilitate preparation of their final proposals.

DEADLINE:  for final installation proposals:  21 OCTOBER, 1995.

We encourage submissions of pieces for Chinese instruments and computer or 
tape and pieces for other Asian instruments and computer or tape.  We also
seek computer or tape pieces with live performers for Javanese or Balinese 
gamelan, saxophonist Daniel Kientzy, percussionist Steven Schick and the 
vocal quartet VOX NOVA (SATB).  Interactive pieces for any of these 
performers are also appropriate.  Opportunities for tape pieces include
the Guangdong Modern Dance Company Concert, the Siri Rama Indian dance 
concert, the Zuni improvised theatre concert, a number of outdoor
concerts on the campus, and the special one-minute "Identity Pieces" 
concert.  

The conference will also feature papers, posters and demonstrations 
of current computer music technology.  Note: Full papers must be submitted
