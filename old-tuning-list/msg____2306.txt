Subject: Just Tuning - definition

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

The Early Music list has just been informed, with the Harvard 
Dictionary of music as authority, that Just Tuning is "any 
tuning that incorporates five or more acoustically pure types 
of intervals within the octave." That means, of course, that 
Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone, and, for that matter, most 
early temperaments, are Just Tunings! Somehow, I don't think 
that is the definition that JI advocates use today.

Would readers email me a short answer to two questions:
1) if the form of the Harvard definition is adequate, with what 
number would you replace their number five?
2) if the definition is inadequate in form, what is the minimum 
set of additional criteria you have to call something a just 
tuning?

I'll summarize the answers to this list, and to the early music 
crowd, without attributions. Thanks for your answers.
