Subject: French spectral composers

From: Franck Jedrzejewski <franck@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr>

The spectral composers work with spectral analysis of a sound. The
decomposition of a sound in partials are used by composers as a primary
material. They build algorithms to move from one spectre to another one.
In this calculation, they usually used approximation in quarter of tone
(not in 1/6, nor 1/8). 

Tristan Murail (not Mureil) born in 1947 is one of the most important 
spectral composer. You could listen his music on :
1- "Gondwana, Desintegrations, Time and again" for orchester, 
Adda/Salabert SCD8902
2- "Memoire/Erosion - C'est un jardin secret, ma soeur, .... - Ethers "
Sappho-003
3- " Allegories - Vues aeriennes - Territoires de l'oubli" 
Accord 200842.
Some CD are sold by the CDMC (Centre de Documentation sur la musique contemporaine)
See the IRCAM WEB pages

See also the Murail Papers in Darmstadtwe Beitrage zur neuen Musik, Mainz, Schott,
1980 and 1982 Also Grisey 'paper in #17, 1978.

Many composers have worked with spectres, not only french composers. See for 
examples the works of : George Benjamin, Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Johannes Fritsch,
Jonathan Harvey, Philippe Hurel, Calin Iochimescu, Mesias Maiguashca, 
Horatiu Radulescu, Kaija Saariaho, Jukka Tiensuu, Gilles Tremblay, Claude Vivier
etc......

Pascal Dusapin, born in 1955, have worrked with Iannis Xenakis. He used in his
music 1/4, 1/6 and 1/8 of tone. You could listen to his music on

Harmonics records HCD 8721 "Laps, Item, Itou, etc...."
Accord 201162 : His opera "Romeo et Juliette"
