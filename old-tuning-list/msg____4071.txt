Subject: Generalized Keyboard

From: "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca>

All,
    While searching the web with the phrase "MIDI controller" I came across
the web page for Starr Labs.  They appear to already make a generalized
keyboard.  Here is something I cut from their pages to paste here:

"Uath-72 , Generalized Keyboard Specifications:

(documentation under construction)
The Uath-72 is the design of Erv Wilson who makes his home in Los Angeles,
California. Mr. Wilson has made a forty-year study in the area of musical
temperament which follows an ongoing thread of research and
experimentation, really from the dawn of Western Music. The Uath-72 is a
1990's rendition of the Bosanquet Generalized Keyboard built in the late
19th century. Bosanquet's original design was a takeoff on the standard
mechanical piano action, modified to present several ranks of keys
organized in levels or tiers. Generally speaking, deviations in pitch from
the standard 12-tone Equal Temepered pitches were organized into the
successive ranks of black and white keys. A full discussion of the
background of this instrument and the study of tunigs and temperament is
beyond the scope of this paper. The modern electronic version of the
keyboard configures the ranks into a flat 2-dimensional planar array of
keys. The onboard computer, the MIDI interface and the availability of
programmable synth engines all conspire to yield a truly programmable
instrument which may be retuned with a button press or two rather than a
week with a piano technician's tuning hammer!"

 Their web address is http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/ for more
information.  The information on this keyboard, also called the MicroZone
can be found at http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/uzone.htm 

I could never have found this and other valuable microtonal information
without the web and the search engines therein.
