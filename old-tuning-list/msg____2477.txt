Subject: Microtonal Composition

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Matthew: I'd like to see more on composition and aesthetics myself. 
To your list you might add Ivan Vyshnegradski whose Manuel d'harmonie 
a' quarts de ton  was translated into English by Ivor Darreg and published 
in Xenharmonikon 6, Summer 1977  under the title Manual of Quartertone
 Harmony (XH6 is available as a photocopy from Frog Peak Music and 
in microform from Xerox  University Microfilms).  
	Also, A. D. Fokker has written a considerable amount on 
composition in JI and JI as mapped into 31-tone ET. Fokker's books are 
Just Intonation and New Music with 31 Notes (translated from the German 
by Leigh Gerdine).
	AFAIK, Blackwood's working notes for his Etudes have
not been published, but when they are they will be an invaluable 
resource for composers who wish to translate common-practice and
early 20th century harmony into 13-24 tone equal temperament. He
used to make xeroxes of his very legible manuscript available at
cost and I recommend them if you haven't seen them.
	BTW, is your dissertation available by xerox, ftp, microform,
or publication?
--John
