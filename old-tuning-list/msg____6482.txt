   The only plausible excuse for any one tuning replacing 12TET, would be
that exploring it requires the entire efforts of every human being in the
World for however long it dominates.

   I'd be amazed if any tuning system exists that requires THAT much
attention.  Even so, I have met quite a few who profess that they don't
want to get into new tunings because they feel that 12TET has not been
sufficiently explored yet.  So I suppose it's a matter of just how much
exploration we should do in a tuning before we deem it as, for realistic
purposes, fully explored.

   With all of the myriads of other tunings available, I'd be inclined to
think that, should some new tuning system come to dominate, that we'd be
better off moving on even if that tuning has clearly not been fully
explored.  That because of the laws of diminishing returns:  We could
probably always eek out a little more from just about any tuning, but the
first 20% exploration of most any new tuning will usually reveal more
interesting musical possibilities than the last 10% of another.
