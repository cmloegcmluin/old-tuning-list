Your comments remind me of a trick we do on my mom's piano.  We would take
advantage of the fact that you couldn't tell what note the lowest key on the
piano was. To make it sound like it can go lower than it really can, we'd
throw in the lowest key (the low A) with another low note.  So a descending
scale would go:
          C
         B
        A
        A     G
        A    F
        A   E
        A  D
        A C

So "Mission Impossible" would go:
        A  D
        A  D
        A    F
        A     G
        A  D
        A  D
        A C
        A C#

An actual "A" would not make as much sense with some of the above intervals,
but the "growl" that came out seemed to go along with any other note.

And all these years I thought it was just a problem with
my mom's crappy piano...
