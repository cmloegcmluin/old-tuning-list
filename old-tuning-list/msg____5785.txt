The three inversions of a triad (that is, three tones without octave
duplications) are intervallically distinct: (in 12tet interval classes:)
4,3,7; 3,5,8 ; 5,4,9. Throw in an additional tone, doubling the lowest
pitch at the octave, and you get: 4,3,5,7,8,12; 3,5,4,8,9,12; 5,4,3,9,7,12,
which are also distinct, shuffling the two-out-of-three combinations of
(7,8,9).  Triadic inversions are equivalent (a) in terms of pitch class content, or(b) under some octave modulus operation where inversions are equivalent. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
