Subject: Re: Neanderthal flute

From: alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)

I didn't want to give my own interpretations of Fink's article before
presenting his thoughts, but now that it has started some good discussion,
I thought I'd jump in.

Fink draws most of his conclusions from the not exactly profound
observation that the holes in the flute are unequally spaced. For some
reason, he thinks that this is a momentous discovery, as most people, he
surmises, would expect primitive Neanderthals to tend to space things
equally. He adopts as one of his assumptions: "As we humans seem to show,
there is a history of a predisposition toward equality in measurements: The
distances between telephone poles; between pickets; between windows on
buildings in the architecture of all periods and cultures; between sidewalk
slabs; between inches; feet, yards, centimeters -- between ranks and files
of all types, etc. "

I don't see what any of this has to do with music. Is any Paleolithic art
symmetrical? Does any of it show equality in measurements? I see no reason
to think that Neanderthals would develop a music based on equal
measurements on flute holes even if they liked to arrange their caves or
other dwellings with the stone age equivalent of regular sidewalk slabs.

That aside, Fink seems to equate unequal with diatonic, for some reason
that I cannot quite fathom. Diatonic means to me a seven note scale with a
certain sequence of tones and semitones, the tones being about twice the
size of the semitones. Now, he has only four tones on this flute. He
postulates a sequence of tone, tone, semitone, which will fit into a
diatonic scale, sure, but also a pelog scale, the in scale of Japan,
certain non-diatonic Eastern European scales, plenty of non-diatonic ragas,
and so on. Unless one stretches one's definition of "diatonic" to include
all of these scales, I don't see any reason to suppose that Neanderthals
were or were not using diatonic melodies. Also, by admitting the
possibility of neutral thirds, he is stretching the term diatonic quite
far.

Fink apparently has another publication which I have not seen in which he
argues that the diatonic and anhemitonic pentatonic scales are the best
musical representations of the harmonic series (what he calls the "overtone
series"). I'm afraid I'm at a loss to understand why four, six, or
forty-three tones per octave can't also model the harmonic series, or how
neutral thirds fit into this scheme, but then I haven't read this other
paper.

Fink, like some other writers, argues for the historic precendence of just
intonation, based only on the beauty and naturalness of the harmonic
series. Now, I love the sounds of many JI intervals, and I use JI in my
music, but to say that it is therefore the fundamental basis for all music
is to misunderstand what art is. This is not to say that the harmonic
series plays no role in the evolution of musical systems, I believe it
plays a very powerful one, but for some cultures, so does the mystical
value of a length of pipe, the ability to transpose, the tension resulting
from temperament, and so on.

Which of these many criteria were important to the Neanderthals? I sure as
hell don't know, and I don't think one fragment of a bone flute will tell
us. Perhaps it was different for the Neanderthals in Spain, or for the
Neanderthals living a hundred or a thousand years earlier or later. It is
much easier for me to conclude that there is some researcher predisposition
here than to extrapolate from this fragment a "natural foundation to the
diatonic scale."
