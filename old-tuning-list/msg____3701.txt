On Sept. 20, I did an hour-long presentation at the University of Manitoba in
Winnipeg entitled <<Tonality in Other Equal Temperaments>>,  in which I outlined
my evolving approach to tonal harmony in >12 ETs, including
19, 22, 27, and 31. I presented a list of just, perceptually distinct 3rds,
5ths, 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths that I recently developed, and provided examples
which demonstrated voice-leading between the ET representatives of those
intervals.

<<I will post more details about this list of intervals in the coming weeks.>>

In the composition seminar later that afternoon, I discussed my general
aesthetic, and presented xenharmonic and xenrhythmic works of mine, and talked
about my Clavette microtonal MIDI keyboard.

Quite a few students were interested, and had some tough and interesting
questions for me.

I left Michael Matthews, the resident composer and head of the electronic
studios, with copies of examples from the lecture, spreadsheets with interval
ratios for 19, 22, 27 and 31-ET, and a sheet of formulas for ET and JI
calculations, which hopefully some students will find useful.

At the end of the day, I completed arrangements which allowed me to take 
their standard keyboard Scalatron and the Electrical Engineering Departments
17/19-tone digital organ back to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, both instruments
are not working, but I intend to get them fixed over the coming months. <<The
17/19-tone digital organ is described in Tempered Music Scales for Sound
Synthesis by M. Yunik and G.W. Swift, in the Computer Music Journal Vol. 4 #4,
Winter 1980.>>

I enjoyed meeting Professor Swift, Music Dept. head Richard Wedgewood, and
appreciated Michael Matthews hospitality.

After reading about Johnny Reinhardts visit to Brookings, South Dakota, I am
thinking that I might eventually arrange a midwestern concert tour with the
Clavette and perhaps these other instruments and additional performers.

Yours truly,
Harold Fortuin
