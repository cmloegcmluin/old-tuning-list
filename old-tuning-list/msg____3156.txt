> Does anyone know of any music for chorus written in other intonations. 

Yes, from your country even:

James Wood: "Incantamenta" (1991) performed by the New London Chamber
Choir. Uses a systematical method of inflection of intonation. On the
CD "Songs by the River" with works for percussion and voices.
Continuum, 1991. CCD 1037 

Another shorter work in just intonation:

Paul Rapoport: "Prelude: De spiritu sancto", with text by Hildegard 
von Bingen for soprano solo, synthesizer and choir. Uses the 14-note
stellated 1 3 5 7 hexany of Erv Wilson. On CD with issue 60 of the
magazine Musicworks, 1994 

Perhaps Giacinto Scelsi also wrote microtonal music for chorus.
