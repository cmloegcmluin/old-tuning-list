   True.  That helps.  

   Attachments can however pose file-length and format problems, along with
fidelity trade-offs to concern yourself with.  And I suspect sure that the
Mills College folks would go broke routinely sending files as large as
sound files (even compressed) tend to be out to a couple hundred people.  

   But again, there are still-somewhat-exotic solutions to those sorts of
limitations, so they fall into the category of what I was refering to when
I said "humans only now are beginning to get around".
