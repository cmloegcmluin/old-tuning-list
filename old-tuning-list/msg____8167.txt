Indeed I have an Amiga, and have all the programs I mentioned (except
"PatchMeister"), and can expecially "vouch" for Todor Fay's programming
"genious" in his "progression" from "SoundScape", "Bars&Pipes Pro", to the
"SuperJAM!"/"Melody Maestro"/"AudioTracks" Pro algorhythmic "paradigms". I hope
someday "Bar&Pipes Pro" may be converted to the PC platform <g>, which is
_still_ superior, IMHO, to most PC/Mac sequencers. (As indeed is Dr. T's "KCS
Level II" with PVG/MPE modules and "Open Mode" programability<g>.)

You might also consider the SSEYO "Koan Pro" 'engine' to have similar
capabilities/competition in direct contrast to Microsoft's "Music Producer". I
hope to get a copy of their patent to fully read.
