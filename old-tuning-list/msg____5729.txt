      I have to disagree.  Even in the Young, the difference between F and F#
is too great to call equally well in tune.  This is a big difference. 
       To my ears and history,  the point of well temperament was to provide
a suitable palette of tonal differences between the keys.  It is the
irregularity of these tunings that was an art form, as opposed to the
scientific procedures we have to use to create a 12TET.

      I think a more precise definition would mention the increasing
tempering of the root tonic thirds with increases in the the key signature.
 It is the contrast between various levels of tempering that was such a
strong topic during the period between Mozart and Chopin.  There is no
contrast in ET, so I would offer that we keep the words separate. 

    I can only see confusion if we are to call ET another well-temperament.
 The overwhelming use of "well-temperament" these days has been  to indicate
the irregular, circulating temperaments that arose between the meantone era
and the proliferation of ET,   which I peg at the mid 1800's, ( I know, there
is a lot of controversy to push that date earlier, or later,  but I don't see
enough supporting evidence to make me think it was really happening before
Chopin.

P.s.  "The Beethoven In The Temperaments"  CD is in the print stage,  and
should be ready September 1.  Once we have that out, these discussions on the
older temperaments can have something to key off of.
