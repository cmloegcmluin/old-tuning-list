Subject: Jimi Hendric chord

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

I must admit that with enough distortion, 8:10:14:19 is the preferable
tuning for this chord, since distortion creates high-order difference
tones. However, we're talking about so much distortion that the
individual notes cease to be audible and all that remains is a harmonic
series above 1. I don't think even Jimi often took distortion to that
extreme. You would have to overdrive a transistor amp to get an idea of
the extreme distortion I'm talking about. Think of the distortion sound
in "Revolution" (fast version) by the Beatles. I think that's transistor
distortion. Vacuum tubes (or a simulation thereof) are the usual means
of effecting a distorted guitar sound and they have a way of letting the
individual notes ring through.
