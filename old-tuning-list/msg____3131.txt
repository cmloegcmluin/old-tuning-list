Congratulations to John Fitch for putting one of
his xenharmonic Csound compositions on his web
page.
To my knowledge no one else has composed anything
in 100-TET, so John Fitch is likely the first.
John says "the composers on this forum can 
probably do better."
I doubt that.
John has shown himself a brilliant programmer and
an insightful subscriber to this tuning forum.  I'd be
surprised if his compositions were less than 
excellent.
Speakingt of insightful posts, John mentioned in
Tunign Digest 712 "surely the answer is to use
software synthesis."
A recent article by Roger Dannenberg in Computer
Music Journal supports John's contention.
Dannenberg does some quick calculations that show
that hardware DSP implementations of synthesis
algorithms must run at least 40 (!) times faster 
than the same routines in software to give any
kind of real-world payoff in less time than it
takes to develop a usable software interface for
the DSP hardware.
The net result?
Dannenberg concludes that "the days of hardware
synthesis are over."  General-purpose CPUs are
increasing in computational power too quickly to
allow DSP hardware to survive.
This is extremely good news for micorotnalists.
The more general-purpose the CPU, the fewer the
restrictions on tuning.  
This means that within a very years all the synthesis
algorithms that now require special-purpose hardware
to run in real time will run on standard desktop boxes
in real time.  Not only that, we'll be able to detewelvulate
at will--in real time--with sophisticated computer music
timbres on cheap general-purpose computers.
I can hardly wait.
