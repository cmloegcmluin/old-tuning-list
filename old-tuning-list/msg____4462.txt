Daniel, I am sorry to contradict your assertion here, as before.  I

Response:

I'm sorry, but I got this opinion from La Monte himself. (Many times
repeated in previous conversations, last in a telephone call two weeks
ago).

Johnny wrote:

The title of his treatise contains the words "easy" and
"practical" which seem to me to make clear the author's desire to fall on
the simpler side of things..

Response:

A quick look at some of the astonishing examples of diminution in the
Morley - of proto- Ferneyhough rhythmic complexity - will convince you that
''plain and easy'' refers to his explanatory technique and not to his
music. I am afraid that you took your signal from Slonimsky and haven't
spent much time dealing with the Morley itself. (I used it teaching
undergrads for a couple of years).

Pitch is merely a smaller unit than
interval.

Response:

This is so bizarre that I will just let it stand.
