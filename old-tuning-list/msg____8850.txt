Subject: Glossary of tuning terms

From: monz@juno.com

I recall some postings about a week ago
regarding an online glossary or dictionary
of tuning and related terms.

I've put a small one on my site, because
I felt the need to have it there.  Terms
on my webpages appear in hypertext and link
directly to the glossary.

The plan is to have it grow larger.  All are
welcome to visit and give me comments or submissions
(your name will appear if it is an original
definition, similar to how I've already done
those by Partch) and to provide a link to it from
your site.
