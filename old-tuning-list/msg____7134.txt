Subject: Interval web site

From: "J. Pusey" <xen@tiac.net>

While in San Diego in December for the holidays I tracked down Jonathan
Glasier at the Sonic Arts Gallery and purchased a complete set of back
issues of Interval. This periodical was published by Jonathan from 1978
to 1987 and contains numerous seminal tuning-related articles by
Jonathan himself, Ivor Darreg, Harry Partch, Erv Wilson, and many
others.

Jonathan expressed an interest in selling more back issues via the
Internet, so I naturally offered to set up some web pages to that end.
With his blessing, I have just made available a web site devoted to
Interval at the following URL:

    http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/interval/

The site includes an overview and ordering information, as well as links
to other pages: tables of contents, author index, subject index
(forthcoming, maybe), title index, and errata (also forthcoming).  It is
structured very similarly to the Xenharmonikon and Pitch for the
International Microtonalist web sites.

Interval back issues are available directly from Jonathan Glasier at the
Sonic Arts Gallery. I am not affiliated with Interval or the Sonic Arts
Gallery in any way.  I am providing these web pages merely as a service
to the xenharmonic community.
