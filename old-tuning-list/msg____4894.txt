Subject: looking towards 1000

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

Thanks to Dave Madole for the interesting account of this list's
subscribers.  I think that the best way to celebrate 1000 would be to thank
him and whoever else is/was involved in providing and maintaining this
discussion group.

The tuning list has, since early 1995, been a great learning tool for me.
It was originally most valuable as a classroom for understanding articles
published in 1/1.  Then I began to survey people about Harry Partch's music
(I still can't properly renotate Guitar II and the backward Kithara II),
and collect addresses and phone numbers which has led to many email
friendships and face-to-face contact with some of you (especially Johnny
Reinhard Paul Ehrlich, and Bill Alves).  People like Larry P. even helped
me choose a graduate school.  Scattered throughout are B. Mclaren's
confrontational yet often enlightening rant-lectures.  More recently, I
have enjoyed its service as a forum for the Harry Partch transcription
debate which brought Jon Szanto into our little circle, and reintroduced me
to Dan Wolf.  This list has sparked an interest in meantone-tunings and
various notation possibilities, plus I have found new avenues in the
glorious musics of the world.

It is only on a list such as this that so many different people can get
together and argue daily about anything that comes to mind under the rubric
of microtonality.  In the old 1/1, Xenharmonikon and _Interval_ issues,
complaints abound about the lack of unity and communication among tuners.
Now, thanks to this list, people with approaches as casual as Neil
Haverstick and as rigorous as John Chalmers can learn from one another, and
I can learn from their arguments or join in myself.

Thanks for indulging me on my personal account of this list's benefits.  I
look forward to meeting more of you at the Oedipus concert and AFMM, and I
look forward to 2000.

-Adam
