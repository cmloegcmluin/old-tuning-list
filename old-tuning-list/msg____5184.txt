Subject: Re: Indian Music

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

For several technical reasons, I cannot recommend the Wade volume (her
volume on solo vocal music is to be recommended, however). In addition, the
material on South India is cursory, and the comparison with an American pop
song is really confused!

If you would like in-depth work on North or South India, all of the (widely
scattered) articles by Harold Powers are well worth looking into.

Karnatic music is probably a clearer repertoire _and_ theoretical
traditional with which to begin. For beginners, I like David Reck's PhD
dissertation, _A Musician's Toolkit_ which is unfortunately only available
from University Microfilms. Likewise, the dissertations of Jon Higgins (on
the music for Bharata Natyam), T. Viswanathan (on Raga Alapana), and K.S.
Subramanian (on a single vina tradition).

In any case, I would listen to a lot of music before beginning a survey of
the theoretical literature. There is simply too much irrelevant and/or
inaccurate material in the literature that only an active encounter with
the performed music can help sort out. Even better is to find a teacher -
either Hindustani or Karnatic - to give you a grounding in raga and tala. I
heartily recommend vocal lessons in combination with rhythmic training
(e.g. South Indian Solkattu).
