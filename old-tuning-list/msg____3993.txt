   I'm the one who posted that conclusion by my K2500-owner friend.  That
conclusion has the potential to be true provided that you're trying to map
linearly across the keyboard, mismatching octave boundaries in the tuning with
octave boundaries in the white/black structure of the keyboard).  

   (An aside:  Speaking for myself, I'm very impressed by people who are capable
of ignoring the 7+5 white/black structure of the traditional keyboard.  Although
I have always found it very difficult to ignore, there can be no doubt that the
majority of people exploring 19 and many other microtonal ETs on keyboard map it
that way, and see nothing particularly problematic about it.)

   I say "has the potential to be true" because somebody down in the bowels of
Kurzweil responded saying that that's not true.  The K2x00 apparently has four
basic capabilities useful for unusual tunings, as I understand it anyway:
1.  You can tune all C-C octaves identically to just about any conceivable 
    pitch.  The limitation is that it must be on C-C (or A-A or whatever) 
    boundaries, and the pattern must repeat in octaves.  Apparently you can 
    have quite a few of this sort of table loaded and can switch off between
    them with a SysEx message.  So you can certainly map 19 into two, three,
    or more 12-toned subsets.  One way that strikes me as reasonable for doing
    this is a tuning table with naturals and sharps, one with naturals and 
    flats, and another with the more common nonnaturals (e.g., F# instead of
    Gb, and Bb instead of A#) and also containing B#/Cb and E#/Fb notes.  You
    can also create 19 tables for each of the 19 possible key signatures.  
2.  You can tune the interval between adjacent keys to a consistent cent 
    distance identical between all adjacent key pairs.  The limitation is that
    you have only 2-cent resolution.  So using this mechanism alone, 19 mapped
    linearly across the keyboard (instead of in 12-toned subsets) turns out 
    way off by the time you reach the 19th key in the sequence.  
3.  The fellow at Kurzweil, who apparently prefers the 12-tone subset approach
    or perhaps doesn't do much with microtonal ETs, says that you can refine 
    this 2-cent resolution using something I think he called a "function".  I 
    don't know the details, nor do I personally know anybody who's 
    successfully implemented this suggestion (not to suggest for a moment that
    I have any reason to think that this Kurzweil fellow is misleading us, of 
    course).
4.  James McCartney, whose address I don't recall, uses a K2000 microtonally
    by using what I suppose might be called a "memorizing controller".  Ap-
    parently the K2x00 has at least one controller which, when you set it to
    some value, it remembers that value.  You can then use it kind of like a 
    pitch-bend by applying it to pitch calculations, and it does NOT affect 
    notes currently playing.  

   Without a doubt, in my mind and many others', Ensoniq's pitch-table approach
is FAR more intuitive and easier to work with.  But certainly in many ways the
K2x00 instruments are more powerful at a purely synthesizer-capability level
than the ASR.  Apparently their effects processor isn't as capable as the ASR's
though.
