Subject: Re:The Wilson Archive

From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I just would like to announce that The Erv Wilson Archive is now up on
the net!  Please bookmark  http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html take a
look and tell me if you can read it or if you have any comments or
suggestions. Those of you who have some of his work that you think
should be up, please let me know and the request will be passed on to
him. I do not have a printer so please don't ask me to relay messages to
Erv. I'm not sure exactly how much I can get up at a time, but when I
run out of room I plan to rotate files on a 3 month period but I will be
updating this daily for quite awhile. Space is one of the reason I am
attempting to keep these files small. I plan to make announcements
periodically as to additions.
    The Moment of Symmetry article represents the birth of this MOS idea
that has been taken up by others. Despite it very simple presentation, I
would like to warn the reader that the implications are far reaching,
especially the second-order MOS which more work could be done with. But
this and all my comments should be considered secondary to the work. The
idea is to let his work finally speak for itself.
