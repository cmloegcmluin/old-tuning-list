Subject: Cris Forster

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Cris Forster was very much involved in the Partch Foundation at
one time but has gone in his own direction since as a composer,
performer and instrument builder  Though obviously inspired by
Partch, Cris told me that it was only after Harry's death that
he learned of his work.

He has built his own orchestra of tuned percussion and plucked
string instruments tuned to a 13-limit system rather than 11-limit
system. The Chrysalis, the rotating circular lyre, is a stunning
instrument. (Forster is a superb cabinet-maker.)
