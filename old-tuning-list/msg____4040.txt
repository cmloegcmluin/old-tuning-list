Subject: A call to action?

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Now that we have addressed Brian M's style, I would like to examine 
the legitimate and important question implicit in his posts of last week.

---> What should we be doing to facilitate the understanding and 
---> appreciation of microtonal music?

It is obvious that the more tuning savvy individuals we have in the 
population, the better off subscribers to this list will be. 

Why?

1) There will be more people to listen to (and buy) our music.
2) Synth manufacturers will think more of the microtonalist when 
   designing a synth than they would otherwise.   
3) Some of us might get jobs teaching where previously we could not.
4) Discussion of musical ideas may become more commonplace, meaning more 
   fun for you and me.
5) Young people will start to play and compose microtonally, bringing 
   fresh ideas to their contemporaries, causing a positive feedback loop. 

And of course the list goes on.

Brian bemoaned the lack of a good microtonal primer on the web. I'll be 
the first to admit that my microtonal tutorial is shallow and slipshod.
David Doty's excellent book "The Just Intonation Primer" is a model of 
clarity of exposition. I would love to link to it instead of offering my 
crude efforts. Does an abbreviated version exist on the web to which I 
could link?

I have searched the web for microtonal sound files and have found slim 
pickings. I am sure I am not alone in the belief that we need to bring 
the sounds of alternate tuning systems to the people, and the web seems 
to me custom made for this purpose. I have a few microtonal sound samples 
and some just interval sine wave samples on my home page. Does anyone 
have any ideas on the best ways to make our ideas heard on the web?

I went to Tower Records yesterday and spent $65 on microtonal CDs. I felt 
like I got about $20 worth of music, not because the music was bad, but 
because the music I bought was mostly  "new age", a style of which I am
not particularly fond (but, as Jerry Seinfeld would say "...not that 
there's anything wrong with it"). Tower Records has a completely separate
room for world music. Wouldn't it be nice if they 
had at least a bin for "microtonal" music, calssified minimally by 
style? The Catler Brothers are quite different from Harry Partch, and 
neither is "new age".
   
I also was frustrated by the lack of exterior liner notes on the CDs. 
Many that I knew were microtonal had no indication of that on the 
outside of the package, and I wonder how many others I missed because of 
this. Maybe we could have an icon for "microtonaliy" that we could include 
in the cover art. Although those in the know can find good dicographies 
on the web and order from the Microtonal Music Source, we need to have 
this stuff available where everyone can find it. 

I know Neil Haverstick does music in the schools programs through the 
Denver Musician's Union. Are we all doing what we can to bring our music 
to young ears, and in a way that will be engaging and encouraging to 
young musicians? I'd love to hear what others in this forum do along 
these lines, as I can use all the new ideas I can get.

Finally, there is probably a core set of microtonal masterpieces on 
which many subscribers will agree. It would be helpful to know what 
these works are in order to intelligently direct the neophyte (and 
seasoned neophytes like myself) to some  appropriate introductory pieces.
Nothing will hurt our cause (ouch! 60s) more than to extoll the virtues of 
xenharmonia to a fresh ear, only to have the possible convert turned off by a 
silly recording of microdoodling. I think Brian listed his top 20 
masterpieces a couple of months agoin response to a Haverstick post...any 
other nominations?

Sorry for the length of the post, but I think we should consider some 
of these things.
