> I don't know what you mean. Can you elaborate? This is what I mean. Take C major, a common diatonic scale. As usually defined, it has six 
consonant triads: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am. These triads are in fact consonant 
when 12-, 19-, 31-tET, or meantone temperament is used to tune the scale. 
In all of these cases, G B D F will be dissonant, and in meantone or 
31-tET, a closer approximation to a 4:5:6:7 chord built on G can be found 
than that which arises from the diatonic scale. That chord is notatod G B 
D E#. However, this chord will not sound correct in C major, despite its 
acoustical purity:

that it needs to resolve to the tonic chord, C E G.

Paul, I think your elaboration is sufficient(g). I'm a barbershopper and 
we don't tune with any *.tet scale that I'm aware of. We tune by ear to 
achieve max consonance. I'm assuming that we tune 4:5:6:7 regardless of 
the the Key note. The G-B-D-E#(F) chrd(sol-ti-re-fa) is one of the basic 
chrds which define the style in it's return to C-E-G(do-mi-sol) via the 
circle of 5ths. But you must at least go to D-F#-A-C(re-fi-la-do) and 
return thru G-B-D-F to C-E-G  to define a simple bbshop progression. What 
you call a "clash" is just returning home via the circle of 5ths and is 
the essence of the bbshop style. Have you ever sung 4 part bbshop 
harmony?
