I don't completely understand from the code what it is that is coming
out of it. You to have to supply weights for 12 notes and then only 7
intervals are compared. Are you comparing the prime on purpose, or is
it always 0 cents? Is the resulting scale always symmetrical? The
error-function seems to be quadratic in the note values, and so far as
I can tell you need indeed an iterative procedure to find the minimum
of it. If there wouldn't be product terms of pitch variables then the
solution could be found algebraically by setting the derivative to 
each of them to zero.
