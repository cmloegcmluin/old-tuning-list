Subject: Re: TUNING digest 619 - Jorgensen book

From: "Laurence W. Key" <flute001@peabody.jhu.edu>

Dear Neil,

   I helped Owen Jorgensen get the "Tuning" book ready for publication.  
It could have been much longer, but the author chose to limit himself to 
English language sources.

   The *technology* needed to tune 12ET was certainly available much 
earlier than the turn of this century, and the mathematical understanding 
of 12ET has been with us for three centuries (or more).  But the ability 
to prove 12ET strictly by ear, by comparing the beat speeds of adjacent 
intervals, was not common until the early years of this century.

   Part of the problem was inertia.  Piano tuners did not use the 
harmonic series as a tool, as they do today.  They prefered the results 
of the older methods, which were based on a melodic comparison of 
intervals.

   Owen Jorgensen is not on line, but I'm sure he would appreciate any 
correspondence on matters of tuning.  His address is:
