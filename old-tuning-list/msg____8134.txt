Theory is apparently explained at http://www.primasounds.com/prima.html,
but I can't retireve the page.  Maybe this is like the instructions to
Mornington Crescent (to choose an analogy most people won't understand).

With tuning to exact 7/4s, intervals between adjacent notes will be 8/7,
except for one that is 44 cents sharper.  Tempering would be to make it
more like 5-equal.  Analysing one of the .au files, this seems to be the
case.  I make the scale this:

                        1  8  64     7  2
                        -  -  --  x  -  -
                        1  7  49     4  1

(They should look like fractions if you're in monospaced mode.)

The note x is tempered midway between the two adjacent notes.  So, those
intervals are 22 cents sharp of 8/7.  I measured this accurately enough
that it can't be 5-equal.

It is particularly difficult to count the cycles of the tempered note, but
I think I've got it right now.  The answer I get is spot on to the nearest
millioctave.  It may be they've done something clever like play the two
just notes together.

With friends like that does it really need enemies?
