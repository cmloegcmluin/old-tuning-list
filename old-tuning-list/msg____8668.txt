Subject: Tuning-List CD News

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

This message comes from Neil Haverstick, who (as most of us know)
arranged the recently-released Tuning-List CD, and whose Email is "still
toast".  It is mostly addressed to the folks mentioned in the message, but
I'll go ahead and send it to the entire list, since I don't think I have
each of you folks' Email addresses individually, and since the rest of you
will probably be interested to hear of the progress and availability of the
CD.

   Neil has sent CDs to Rick Sanford, Stephen James Taylor, and Carter
Scholz (actually, it turns out that they'll actually be shipped this
up-coming Monday).  He has received shipping costs from John Loffink and
Bill Alves, and he'll begin the process of painstankingly assembling the
suckers one by one for them this weekend.  (I suggested that he leave that
task to each of us contributors, but it seems that Neil's just too nice a
guy for that!)

   So CDs will very soon be available from those tuners!  So place your
orders with your favorite of these tuning-listers, or with Warren Burt,
Bill Sethares, Denny Genovese, Ernie Crews, or me.  Warren, Bill, Denny,
and Ernie will have their copies as soon as they send Neil the shipping
money, and Neil has a chance to assemble them.  (I have available now.)

   The CD turned out quite well, as you've heard Neil, John Starrett, and I
comment.
