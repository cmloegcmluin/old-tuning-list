Subject: Re: The tuning community

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	On his way from Gainesville FL to San Diego CA, Denny Genovese 
and his wife Linda stopped by Denver and stayed a couple of nights. We 
cooked, played music, swapped CDs and talked theory. Denny tuned my piano 
and made a compost pit. This is the sort of thing that makes a community. 
If it weren't for the tuning forum, we may never have met. Hooray for the 
internet and discussion groups!
