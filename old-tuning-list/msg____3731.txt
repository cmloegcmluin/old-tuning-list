Subject: Answer to my own question: Beers and Frequencies

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

I have not yet located the original experiment, but I have more details on
the duplication of the experiment by artists James Turrell and Robert
Irwin.

In Craig Adcock-s monograph on the artist _James Turrell_ (subtitled _The
Art of Light and Space_), I found the following:

_...the team redid a lighthearted study carried out by Kristian Holt-Hansen
in 1968 involving _Taste and Pitch_. The _experiment_ tested how the tastes
of Carlsberg Lager and Carlsberg Elephant beer were affected by sound:
_Certain tones produced no effect on the tastes of the beers, but when the
relationship occurred, i.e., when the tone was at the particular pitch
cited (650 Hz for the Elephant beer, 10-15 Hz for the lager), the beer
tasted distinctly better._

Lawrence Wechsler (in _Seeing is Forgetting The Name of the Thing One
Sees_) states the result slightly differently:

_...they were able to confirm that Carlsberg Elephant Beer tastes best when
drunk within the aural context of a particular tone (650 Hz) and that
varying that pitch only slightly renders the brew almost undrinkable._

I look forward to hearing of any further confirmations of this experimental
data. The Carlsberg brewery assures me that there have been no substantial
changes in their product since 1968.
