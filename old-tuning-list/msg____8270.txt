Between NewBand and the American Festival of Microtonal Music,I've heard most of the
winds and brass used for microtonality.Some other examples: La Monte Young's Second
Dream ofthe High Tension Stepdown Transformer (8 harmon mute trumpets),
Terry Riley's Chanting the Light of Foresight (Sax. Qt.),
Horatiu Radulescu's Inner Time (clarinet ensemble)...
