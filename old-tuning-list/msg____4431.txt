All-
	In response to Gary Morrison's post on the distinction between just and 
pure, I thought I was reasonably careful in my steel guitar post, using 
pure in reference to the tuning of beatless chords, and "just" in 
quotes in reference to the tuning of the whole steel guitar, but 
upon rereading it I noticed that the just in the title was without 
quotes and "pure" had 'em. Switch the quotation marks between 
those two and we're cool. 
The two "standard" tunings of pedal steel necks are C6 (Nashville) and 
E9, and neither determines an entire diatonic scale (there are many 
exceptions, for instance Bobby Lee's diatonic tuning, check 
http://www.wco.com:80/~quasar/tunings.htm for instance). Should 
the string pitches of a tuning reduced to an octave be, for instance, 
1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1 
I think it is reasonable to use the term just without quotes. 
"Just" seems reasonable to me as a term describing a 
conglomerate of purely tuned intervals linked by common tones, but still 
short of a diatonic scale. 

Perhaps I am missing a more subtle point Gary is trying to make.
