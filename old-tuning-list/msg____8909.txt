I agree, and suggest a more colorful version of the
12-in-a-circle-with-a-line-thru-it ("no 12's allowed")
used as a background on John Starrett's webpage.

We have a copy of the CD at Sonic Arts, and I'd like to
say that I'm impressed with it.  All the music is good,
there's a nice variety of styles (which I think is
important), and it's well-produced.

My personal favorites are Bill Alves's piece (which I
can't get out of my head), and Starrett's hilarious
19-eq rock tunes.

Unfortunately, this is true.  Personally I applaud
the variety, but having worked as both a radio DJ and
in record-store sales, I can attest to the fact that
people will shy away from something that goes "out
of format".  This is probably a result of social
conditioning by what radio stations and record
companies expose us to, and it is deplorable, but
sadly, it is a fact.  It probably is a good idea to
make "theme" CDs as suggested by Loffink.
