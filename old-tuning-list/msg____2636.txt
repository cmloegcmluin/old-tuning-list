Subject: Re: Positive Temperaments Again

From: Gary <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I don't claim to be an expert on the topic, but I get the impression that the
definition is not as much that the fifth is larger than 700 cents, as much as it
is that 12 fifths is larger than 7 octaves.  

   Those are of course exactly equivalent statements (until you get to
stretched-octave-based temperaments).  But my point is that, if I understand the
idea correctly, the fact that the ... "projection" for lack of a better word ...
of the pythagorean comma in these tunings effectively becomes negative in size
is what is interesting about these tunings.
