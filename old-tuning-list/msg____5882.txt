Why do people have such a problem with theory that doesn't lead to
practice?  Theory is fun!  We aren't doing anyone any harm, so
why not leave us be?

In particular, Jo Hainline said that "the purpose of theoretical
science is to make better science."  What does "better science"
mean?  Better experiments?  Better technologies?  And where does
this leave Pure Maths?  Would all the theoretical work done on
Nuclear Physics have been less justified if it hadn't produced
the H-bomb?  I hate to be controversial, but I think that the
opposite is true.


Apologies if I'm asking too many questions today.
