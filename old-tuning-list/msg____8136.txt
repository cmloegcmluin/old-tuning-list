 I've seen Jicalc but Scala seems more suitable for
working with Csound and it has an amazing scales archive. Is there any way
of accessing the scales archive from Jicalc ?  Does JiCalc have script
files (equivalent of .CMD files in Scala) ?

There is no way of directly reading Scala files into JICalc, but JICalc can
import and export scales in its own well-defined & documented (in the Help
stack) text format.  Writing an external utility to translate Scala files
into this format shouldn't be that difficult.  Perhaps a future version
will include the translation.

JICalc has no scripting per se.  Conceivably AppleScript could be used to
control the Hypercard engine, but I don't know enough about AppleScript to
guess how possible or difficult this would be for your purpose.
