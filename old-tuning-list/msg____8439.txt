Thanks, Kraig!  She's a beaut!  Very neatly organized - it crams a lot of
goodies into 12 tones per duple.  The one thing I don't like about the
septimal tuning I posted earlier (I don't know quite what to call it) is that,
surprisingly, it has no 7/4s or 7/6s in it anywhere.  I'm sure I won't be the
only one to tune this one up and try it out.  What does "centaur" mean in this
context?  I'm familiar with the mythical human/horse creature of that
nomenclature but don't see any connection to the tuning.  Is it something
numerological?

Hey, I like the "cap" terminology, if for no other reason than the possibility
of making a clear distinction from the odd-limit concept.  I believe Paul E.
has made the point very solidly that there is a valid odd limit to a sonority
that is distinct from the prime limit of a rational tuning system.  What do
you all think?  "Cap" for what we used to call "prime limit," and use "limit"
only for "odd limit"?  Is it too late to change terms?

BTW, where is Anaphoria Island?  Do they have any interesting native music?

Just tune it!
