Subject: Neil's Tuning-List CD Again

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

Somebody asked to whom she should write the check for the tuning-list
compilation CD.  If you order it from me at least, then write it out to
me.  I suspect that that will be true if you order the CD from the other
people offering it, but I shouldn't speak for them.

   As for which of us you order the CD from, perhaps a good rule of thumb
might be to order it from which ever of us you know the best.  And failing
that, perhaps it could be the one of us to whom you're geographically
closest?  Waddaya folks think?
