From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

In regard to the steel guitar work of Chas Smith, his self published
record which I believed was called Nakakai or something like that (I
will find out) used quite a bit of just intonation via tubes tuned to
the diamond. Quite impressive stuff but he says he just does country
music now (I don"t believe him).
	As for Danielou, Levy's work I find to be useless in that his
conclusion fail to state that India has any real tuning at all. On the
other hand Erv Wilson's work with A. Dusgupta (who was quite capable of
not being fooled by a two cent difference!) came up with an almost
indentical scale of 22. Their differances was in commatic choices in
the use of ragas. That much of our brain processing has been shown to
result by the processing of sum and differances tones in itself implys
that just intonation a natural outcome especially when working with a
drone! Having played on Erv's 22 tone tubes tuned to this scale and
listening to much indian music I hear the scales being the same.
	There is a quite different scale used on Anaphoria Island. Those not
familiar can look at the embassy website at www.anaphoria.com
	Great things in all your comments ,but my ancestors (the ones that
weren't already here!) came here to get away from Europe and there is no
land that has ever demanded a music and art of its own than here. So
maybe those that rely so much on the European tradition might concider
corecting the mistake of being here and moving back!(I wouldn't mind you
taking the Getty with you and returning the goods to its rightful
owners!)
