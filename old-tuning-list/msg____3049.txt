Subject: Writings of a scarlet aardvark
--
Having just ordered "Writings of a scarlet
aardvark" from Frog Peak, permit me to 
recommend it as a model of the kind
of discussion so many people have asked
for more of on his forum: discussion of 
the compositional uses of microtonality
(and algorithmic composition, and live
electronics).
Warren Burt is one of the leading lights of
Australian real-time computer music.  He's
also a long-time microtonalist.
This collection of his articles should be on
the shelf of every microtonalist.
