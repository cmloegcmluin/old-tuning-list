Dave Hill's legendary tape series Introduction to Nontraditional Harmony,
demonstrates the effects of temperament (12-tone equal-temperament in
particular) similarly.  In the case of the major thirds, he lays down a the
root, adds the third, then adds in the P5, and procedes to inversions of that
chord.  Throughout that whole time he let's the third slide back and forth
between just and 12-equal pitches.  He does similar demonstrations with 6:5
minor and 7:6 subminor thirds.  

   Last I heard, the the Just Intonation Store sells Dave Hill's lecture demo.
