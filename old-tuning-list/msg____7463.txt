I recommend the Ensoniq ASR-X over the ASR-10 because of improvements other
than the microtonal features.  Currently it is the best (keyboardless)
workstation for full keyboard scales, with the Korg Trinity series as a
strong second choice.  But I recall someone mentioning that the dynamic
intonation feature was not implemented in the MR Rack.

You're forgetting the 4 pitch table selection limit.  Anyway, since I don't
have a generalized keyboard it is easier for me to match the 12 note per
octave limit of my keyboard to my just intonation scales, and then switch
between scales if I need some new intervals.  Matching octave boundaries for
scales over 12 notes would make things easier, in my opinion.  I was never
able to visualize a linear mapping properly.  The limit here is our
interface to the piano keyboard, not the intonation tables.

Each note is tunable over the full MIDI range (uses same programs and pitch
tables as DX7IIFD).  It's FM timbres make a good counterpoint to today's
wavetable synthesis.  The Yamaha TX802 has been out of production for quite
some time, but you can pick up used units fairly easily for $300-$400.  You
need a memory cartridge to do the 64 tuning tables, however, so make sure it
comes with one as those are difficult to find these days.

K2000/K2500 octave-based intonation tables allow retuning over the entire
MIDI range for each note.  Even the tonic can be retuned, which is why it
makes modulation in just intonation so easy.  nTET and nCET scales can be
created at the program level by adjusting a few parameters, and are
unlimited in step size.  Resolution is 1 cent or better if done correctly
(see my web site).

You are correct.  I was mistaken on the Ensoniq SysEx codes -- chalk it up
to faulty memory.  Only the individual note SysEx codes (realtime updates)
are broken, not the pitch table SysEx dump.  In fact, 5-6 years ago I worked
on a patch editing template for EPS and EPS-16 Plus Pitch Tables for Sound
Quest's "MIDIQuest" generic MIDI patch editor, available for most computer
platforms.  It shows all the pitch adjustments at once.  But it updates the
table by dumping the entire thing, rather than just changing each parameter.
As I recall it only worked on the first pitch table, but I could probably
fix that if anyone is interested in it.  I also had working instrument and
layer templates.  The wavesample template was never completed due to several
obstacles, the worst being that wavesample "all" editing SysEx did not work.
These SysEx problems were eventually acknowledged by Ensoniq, after much
arm-twisting on my part.

Older Korg equipment has the +-50 cents limitation.  I'm not sure where the
cutoff date/line is.  I'm dependent on user feedback to keep the Microtonal
Synthesis Web Site up to date since I cannot possibly get access to all
those instruments.

	not limited to 12-note scales.  Thanks, Andrew Kaye

In that case I recommend Ensoniq's MR Rack or ASR-X, Korg's Trinity series
or an Emu module.  If price is an issue then used Yamaha FM synthesizers and
Ensoniq samplers can usually be found for less than $600, but then you give
up the internal effects buses of the current units.

The EPS SysEx virtual keypad interface had problems that kept it from being
useful.  As I recall I tried to use it to select pitch tables to get past
the 4 pitch table selection limit, and it kept switching back to the
instrument parameter page instead of the layer page that I needed to access.
