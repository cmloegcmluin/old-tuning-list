Level 1 consistency, or just consistency, at some limit x is what you
have when all triads within the x-limit can be consistently represented,
e.g. the tuning's closest approximation of the larger interval is the
sum of the closest approximations of the two smaller intervals.
Example: in 24TET, 5/4 is about 8 steps and 7/5 is about 12 steps, but
7/4 is closer to 19 steps than 20.  Ergo, 24TET is not consistent at the
7-limit, because you can't tune a 4:5:7 triad so that all intervals are
represented as accurately as the tuning allows.

For higher consistency levels, consistent representations exist not only
for all the x-limit intervals, but also combinations of up to n of them.
Example: 12TET is level 3 consistent at the 5-limit because even a stack
of three of the interval which is represented with the greatest error,
the 6/5 (that is, 6/5 x 6/5 x 6/5 = 216/125) is represented
consistently: the closest 12TET approximation to 216/125 is 9 steps,
which equals 3 times the 3-step interval which best approximates the
6/5.

You can find tables of consistency levels at

http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist.txt

and

http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist2.txt

The first is simply all the consistency levels at all the relevant
limits up to 1200TET; the second only includes an ET if there is some
limit at which it exhibits a higher consistency level than any smaller
numbered ET, going up to 10000TET.  (A period signifies level 1
consistency.)

Incidentally, I think this may relate to why Haba isn't thought of much
these days: as you can see by examining the tables cited above, simply
subdividing the semitones of 12TET doesn't really yield you very good
representations of harmonic intervals until you get up to 72TET which is
level 2 consistent at the 11-limit, but that's a bit too big of a jump
for some people; too many notes.  ("--Herr Mozart." 8-)> )  Most of us
find it quite daunting enough trying develop something that makes sense
down in the 19/22/31 range.
