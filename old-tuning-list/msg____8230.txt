Reading this, I wondered where Sauveur came up with 301, and Ellis tells
me it is a 7-way subdivision of his cycle of 43 merides (hence,
heptamerides, duh).  However, what is his reasoning for choosing 43?  I
quite figure out much that's very noteworthy about 43 except that it's
very close to 1/5-comma meantone.  And 301's not bad, but in that same
neighborhood 270 is much better for anything under the 17-limit.
