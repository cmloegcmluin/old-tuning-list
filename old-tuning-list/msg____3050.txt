I was not at the concerts at the Knitting Factory, but having helped to
produce the two weeks of concerts that made it on to the album, I can tell
what I do know about some of this.

When he performed at The Kitchen, he only used the piano patch.  The Bflat
is tuned to 60hz.  As far as I know, the Korg is 48 note polyphonic.
During the opening section which LaMonte refers to as "clouds" a great deal
of difference tones are produced, thanks to the tuning.  That's probably
what you're hearing that's not subject to the attack and release

Good question.  LaMonte's been exploring this terrain for a long time.  Who
knows what he's trained himself to hear.
