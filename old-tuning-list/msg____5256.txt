Subject: Neanderthal flute

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I think this is fascinating, but I echo Gary's concern about the pitch
relations since the flute is not intact. I might also add that not all
"archaeomusicologists" accept Kilmer's and Duchesne-Guillemin's 
interpretation of the Hurrian cult hymn, and Babylonian notation in 
general, as being polyphonic. It is hard to believe that a musical 
notation could evolve which did not allow for the easy notation of 
single notes, but only two-part chords.

M.L. West, author of the best book (IMO) on ancient Greek music  
has written an article "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the 
Hurrian Melodic Texts," Music and Letters 75(2): 161-179 (1994) in
which he/she interprets the dyads as strings to be played by the two 
hands of the harpist.  West does accept the cyclic principle of 
tuning by 5ths, 4ths and octaves (aka Pythagorean), 7 modes and 12 
"chromatic" notes in the octave. West's transcription, however, 
suggests an extremely repetitive melody and a narrow range. The phrase 
or line endings do make some musical sense.

By a statistical method, David Halperin has come up with a very 
different transcription which involves a considerable degree of
descending scalar motion. His paper is in Musikometrika 4: 101-115 
(1992). (the volume # could be 1 as my xerox copy is smeared)

The notation and nomenclature may be traced back to King Lipit-Ishtar
of Nippur (2nd millennium BCE) and even to the Sumerian ruler Shulgi 
in the 22nd century BCE. I think the data are sufficient to establish 
the antiquity of the "Pythagorean" tuning in the West and for that 
matter the influence of Babylon on Greek math and music ("Harmonics"). 
Some Chinese sources claim a priority of some 500 years for the discovery 
of this tuning, but most scholars believe the early Chinese dates to be 
exaggerated and instead refer to the first emperor, Shih Huang Di, in 
the 3rd century BCE when Chinese and Hellenic culture came into contact, 
partly as a result of Alexander's conquests.

For what it's worth, West believes neutral intervals to be found on
some surviving auloi, as mentioned by Aristoxenos. West also believes
Kathleen Schlesinger ignored the unequally spaced holes of the known 
auloi when she developed the theories expressed in her opus "The Greek 
Aulos." Certainly neutral intervals are not rare in world music today.
The Greek hemiolic chromatic may be the relict of a neutral pentatonic
(also the spondeion scale) and neutral intervals are common in Islamic
music, Africa, etc.
