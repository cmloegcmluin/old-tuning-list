>4. It can run across networks, since it's in Java.
>5. Where Max supports (I think) just a few simple data types, like midi &c.,
>Rusty unit generators can exchange many very complex musical objects---

>are just a lot of very natural classes with a lot of power behind them,
>e.g., scales that know how to tune themselves.
>you can check out Grid's homepage:
>http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/pub/Ian.taylor/Grid
>which even includes a link to Rusty's homepage.  Ian, Grid's author,
>could probably tell you more about the advantages Grid has over Max.
>In fact, I think he might be working on some midi and synthesis unit
>generators soon.
