Subject: microtuning software for Macs

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Greetings All,

First these messages... 
I've been unable to get online for days now, since  the phone co. =
(shitty govt. monopoly)
sent me an absurd phone bill that I absolutely refused to pay ,foll. =
which they cut the line. I've complained formally, but don't expect =
to ever have it resolved. I now have to go into town
and use a local business services place to get wired. 

Anyway...
Just discovered a neat piece(s)  of software  for the Mac which uses =
pitch-bends to achieve 
ANY equal temperament, regardless of octaves, etc. 
Yes, you can now use your Rolands, Korgs, Yamahas ,etc. which are =
limited
to 12-note scales, to work with any <n-CET> and <n-TET> tunings.
Possisbilities include 19-TET, 53-TET, 88-CET, Wendy Carlos' Alpha, =
Beta, etc.

It is however (from what I've been able to ascertain) limited to a =
maximum of 4 voices of polyphony.
Also, the manual is in French. I've done a strange translation of =
some of it, using my "rudimentary" French and a pocket dictionary. =
Send me a note and I'll e-mail a compressed text file over. 

It, or rather they (a set of MIDI "algorithmic toys"), are called =
"MIDI formers" and are from

	Fax: 42 30 49 88
	Email: ina.grm@applelink.apple.com

Not sure if they have a website/ftp site with these thingies =
available for download. I've 
sent them an e-mail and will report back when I receive a reply.

They're actually Max patches that work with the free runtime version =
of Max, MaxPlay 3.0.
That's what I'm using it with. 

I deduce it works it's mojo by first picking out the MIDI note =
nearest to the target pitch, and then applying a pitch bend. It also =
bounces around four MIDI channels, because of the nature of pitch =
bends. 


This seems a neat way of using pitch bends, with little limitation. =
Instead of the approach of ,say
Real Time Tuner, where individual MIDI ch.s are assigned to =
individual pitches, allowing as many
notes in a tuning as there are MIDI ch.s ,minus one for MIDI control. 

All you have to do is allow the assignment of as many MIDI ch.s to an =
"instrument"/ multitimbral
part as you want polyphony for that part ( a min. of 2 and a max. =
limited only by the polyphony of your synth). THen just let the =
program bounce around these ch.s. Perhaps Real Time Tuner can be 
changed to work this way. I'd send the developer(s) a note, but have =
no e-mail contact info.

OR, maybe some nice Max toting lister will write a flexible =
patch/stand-alone program implementing this ?


Salut,
Drew

could sing it like Mario Lanza,
we could even chuck the concertina.

non ?
