Subject: A generalized approach to harmony
 in non-just non-equal-tempered scales
---
"Observe constantly that all things take place
by change, and accustom yourself to consider that
the nature of the universe loves nothing so much
as to change the things which are to make new things 
like them.  For everthing that exists is in a manner
the seed of that which will be." [Marcus Aurelius, 
"Meditations"]
Bill Sethares and Your Humble E-Mail Correspondent
have both struggled for more than a year with the
vertical implications of non-just non-equal-tempered
scales.
While Bill's spectral mapping procedure offers a
way of adroitly controlling *sensory* consonance
and dissonance in n-j n-e-t scales, this is quite a
different matter from the tonal substructure implicit
within the scale.
Douglas Keislar's PhD thesis makes this clear. By
rendering a scale like (say) 13/oct more consonant
on the level of individual partials interacting
within the critical band, we do *not* produce
any greater sense of overall "tonality" for the listener.
Even with smoothly beatless chords, 13-TET *still*
sounds profoundly anti-tonal and non-cadential. Even
though a I-IV-V-I may be made beatless through the
miracle of modern digital signal processing, it still
doesn't sound like "the way the scale wants to behave."
And thus other compositional strategies must be 
employed, different from  those dragged out of 12-TET 
and press-ganged into service. 
In short, "I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto."
And outside of 12-TET, you'd better take that into 
account...or your compositions will sound like very
badly out-of-tune 12-TET leftovers.
These complexities are sufficient to give pause to
a composer contemplating a work in 19- or 53-tone
equal, or (say) 13-limit or 31-limit JI; but when
it comes to non-just non-equal-tempered tunings,
what's a xenharmonic composer to do?
The first and most important point in generating
vertical structures in non-just non-equal-scales
is to recognize that some general procedures *do*
carry over from other tunings, albeit in highly
modified form.
John Chalmers has elaborated a classical method
for scale construction which he calls "tritriadic"
scale generation.  The basic idea (based on a very
ancient principle) is that scales have typically
been generated by taking the Tonic,  forming a triad;
then a Mediant, and forming a triad, and finally
a Dominant, and forming a triad.  The set of tones
formed by the union of all the pitches in the triads
has conventionally produced the scales characteristic
of Western music.  John's inspiration was to vary
the frequency ratios of the T, D and M chords to
generate variant scales. (John Chalmers' tritriadic
techniques have been unjustly neglected as a topic
for this tuning forum; if something doesn't change,
clearly I shall have to author several future posts
on the subject.) 
Interestingly, something akin to this procedure can be
employed with non-just non-equal-tempered tunings.
One of the more obvious n-j n-e-t scales is the
set of modes of the ideal vibrating cylinder free at
both ends.  These are given by Lord Rayleigh (1896)
in his "Theory of Acoustics," Vol. 2, pg. 25, refining
the result obtained by Hoppe in 1871:
The frequency f of each partial is proportional to
sqrt[[s^2]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/(s^2 + 1)]   
Setting s successivey to 2, 3, 4... and referring each
tone to the fundamental of the inharmonic series,
the partial frequencies are:
f0 = sqrt(4*9/5) = 2.68328/2.68328 = 1.0
f1 = sqrt(9*64/10) = 7.58946/2.68328 = 2.82842
f2 = sqrt(16*225/17) = 14.55197/2.68328 = 5.4320
f3 = sqrt(25*576/26) = 23.5339/2.68328 = 8.77057
f4 = sqrt(36*1225/37) = 34.5329/2.68328 = 12.8696
f5 = sqrt(49*2304/50) = 47.5173/2.68328 = 17.7086
f6 = sqrt(64*3969/65) = 62.5135/2.68328 = 23.297422
f7 = sqrt(81*6400/82) = 79.510699/2.68328 = 29.631905
f8 = sqrt(100*9801/101) = 98.508682/2.68328 = 36.71204
f9 = sqrt(121*14400/120) = 120.00417/2.68328 = 44.72294
f10 = sqrt(144*20449/143) = 143.49913/2.68328 = 53.47899
&c.
Reducing these values to cents gives
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 =  1799.99 cents
Pitch 3 =  2926.97 cents
Pitch 4 =  3759.204 cents
Pitch 5 =  4423.074 cents
Pitch 6 =  4975.653 cents
Pitch 7 =  5450.5181 cents
Pitch 8 =  5866.8954 cents
Pitch 9 =  6237.8177 cents
Pitch 10 = 6579.5317 cents
Pitch 11 = 6889.0807 cents
&c.
The primary consonant vertical structure in this
system will be the complex Pitch 1 + Pitch 2 + Pitch 3.
This is the *least* compact vertical structure available;
notice that, because of the wide spacing between
members of this inharmonic series, Plomp & Levelt's
findings tell us that this primary vertical structure
in this n-j n-e-t tuning will be consonant (provided
that the timbre is made up of partials tuned to this
scale) because no two partials will fall within the
same critical band.
However, there are other consonant vertical structures
than the primary: for example, members 2, 3 and 4
of this inharmonic series could be used as a chord.
This would produce:
Secondary vertical structure: 
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 =  1126.98 cents
Pitch 3 = 1959.214 cents
A third-order vertical structure comes from
members 3, 4 and 5 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 832.234 cents
Pitch 3 = 1496.104 cents
And a fourth-order vertical structure comes
from members 4, 5 and 6 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 663.87 cents
Pitch 3 = 1216.449 cents
A fifth-order vertical structure comes from
member 5, 6 and 7 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 552.579 cents
Pitch 3 = 1027.4441 cents
A sixth-order vertical structure comes
from members 6, 7 and 8 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 474.858 cents
Pitch 3 = 891.2424 cents
A 7th-order vertical structure comes from
members 7, 8 and 9 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 416.3773 cents
Pitch 3 = 787.2995 cents
And an 8th-order vertical structures comes
from members 8, 9 and 10 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 370.9223 cents
Pitch 3 = 712.6363 cents
This is a slightly stretched neutral triad with
both the fifth and the third somewhat sharper
than the values of Erv Wilson's hypermeantone
scale. 
A 9th-order vertical structures comes
from members 8, 9 and 10 of the inharmonic series:
Pitch 1 = 0 cents
Pitch 2 = 341.714 cents
Pitch 3 = 651.263 cents
This vertical structure is not consonant because
the distance between Pitch 2 and Pitch 3 is less
than a critical bandwidth (290.5 cents) in the midrange
of human hearing.  (At extremely high frequencies this
vertical complex would sound consonant, primarily
because the upper partials lie above the range of human
hearing.)
Subsequent nth-order vertical complexes will
clearly be less consonant.
This gives us a set of harmonies which can be
transposed to different steps of the scale to
produce inharmonic progressions.  (Again, we
assume the partials are matched to the tuning.)
Several points of note:
First, John Chalmers' tritriadic scale generation
techniques can be employed with the 8th-order
consonant vertical structure.  It will produce 
modes significantly different from those familiar
from the harmonic series.  
Second, the inharmonic series considered here
requires us to travel farther up to find a familiar
vertical structure than does the ordinary harmonic
series.  In the classical Western case, the 4th-order
vertical structure using harmonic series members
4, 5 and 6 forms the basis of Western harmony. Here,
the 8th-order vertical structures using inharmonic
series members 8, 9 and 10 form the basis of 
n-j n-e-t harmony in this particular inharmonic
series.  
Third, different inharmonic series can easily be
generated by modifying the equation for the modes
of a vibrating tube.  For instance, instead of
The frequency f of each partial being proportional to
sqrt[[s^2]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/(s^2 + 1)] , we could set
f proportional to 
sqrt[[(s + 1)^2]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/s^2]
or
sqrt[[(s + 3)^2]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/(s+1)^2]
or
sqrt[[(s + 5)^2]*[(s^2 -3)^2]/(s+1)^2]
or
cube root of[[(s + 1)^2]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/s^2]
or
cube root of [[(s + 1)^3]*[(s^2 -1)^2]/s^3]
or
sqrt[[(s - 1)^2]*[s^3]/s^2] 
and so on.  Clearly there are an infinite
number of equations describing non-just
non-equal-tempered scales, which can be obtained
merely by varying the equation for the modes
of a vibrating cylinder. 
A larger question is: What physical oscillator
geometry corresponds to a given arbitrary
equation?  This is an extraordinarily difficult
problem.  It may be insoluble.  While the inverse
problem--given an arbitrary oscillator geometry,
can the equation describing the modes of the system
be found?--can at least be attacked numerically
(if all else fails), the problem of obtaining an
oscillator geometry from an inspection of the
equations describing the modes of a cylinder may
not have a single-valued solution.  That is, different
physical oscillatory system may produce the same
frequency spectrum. 
This has been proven true in several cases, particularly
the case of different drum geometries, and may
be true for all physical oscillators. (For discussion of 
a general mathematical proof of this proposition, see 
Gordon, C., Webb D., and S. Wolpert, "One Cannot Hear 
the Shape Of A Drum," Bulletin of the American 
Mathematical Society (New Series), July 1992, Vol. 
27, No. 1, pp.134-138)
Thus far, we have examined only the overtone-
equivalent members of the inharmonic series.
What about subinharmonic vertical structures?
That is the subject of the next post.
