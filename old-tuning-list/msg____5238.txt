I've had this book for several years and find it fascinating... but I felt
that I should offer a little caveat for those who are intending to read it.

Basically, Tame is completely against all music of the 20th century.
To him, Beethoven and Wagner are the ultimate musics.

He claims that jazz introduces heart arhythms... that rock music makes
the listener tend to violence... I don't remember what he claims about
"New Music" but it wasn't very positive.

Not that he is necessarily way off-base... for example, I remember
reading several years ago in Science Times that there seemed to be
good documentary evidence that playing 20th century music did give
classical players more headaches, muscle and joint problems, etc.

But still, I'd recommend many grains of salt when reading "The Secret
Power of Music."
