Subject: Comments on Manuel's mode list

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Re Manuel's list of Modes:
 
I'm puzzled how Javanese pathet names became attached to Thai
modes, but I suspect it is because there is a persistent bit of
misinformation that Pelog is 7-tone equal temperament. It is not;
it is a 7 tone unequal scale that varies from gamelan to gamelan.
One might map various pelogs onto 9-tone ET or even 23, but is
would be a very non-Indonesian thing to do.
	Anyway, there are 15 possible 5 tone modes in 7-tet:
1a. 	2 1 2 1 1	1b. 	2 2 1 1 1	1c.	3 1 1 1 1
2a.	1 2 1 1 2	2b.	2 1 1 1 2	2c.	1 3 1 1 1
3a.	2 1 1 2 1	3b.	1 1 1 2 2	3c.	1 1 3 1 1
4a.	1 1 2 1 2	4b.	1 1 2 2 1	4c.	1 1 1 3 1
5a.	1 2 1 2 1	5b.	1 2 2 1 1	5c.	1 1 1 1 3
 
Lou Harrison has played in 1a, 2a and 4a. The "Thai" modes correspond 
to numbers 4a, 2a and 2b. I suspect that the a modes are the most 
common and I would  think the c modes would be hard to use.
 
I had forgotten that the Greek chromatic is found in South India
as well as the enharmonic without the divided semitone. There is a
discussion of tuning currently on the rec.music.indian.classical Usenet
newsgroup and the influence of Greek theory has been mentioned, though
not yet discussed. I will post anything especially interesting to Tuning.
