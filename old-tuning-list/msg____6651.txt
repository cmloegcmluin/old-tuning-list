When I refer to the number of pitches that may be remembered in a given
melody, I do not mean to question musicians' ability to modulate. It is
not uncommon to find all 12 tones used in a single piece. But such
pieces do not consist of a single melody. Again, a melody may use more
than 9 pitches, but the more are used within  a single melody beyond 9
or so (obviously there is nothing sacred about any particular number)
the larger a percentage of the audience will remember the melody in a
simplified form, and the fewer will remember - or like - the melody.

The use of about 7 tones in the octave for most Western melody may
therefore be much more than purely a matter of tradition.

There is also the matter of ornamental or incidental pitches to
consider. The Indians normally use 7-tone modes, I believe, but many
more secondary or improvised tones.
