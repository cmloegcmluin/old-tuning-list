Subject: Re: Harmonica tunings

From: World Harmony Project <sejic@afn.org>

I am very interested in the harmonica tunings, brought up by Pat Missin. I
used to play Harps in the 60's, but didn't know that they were tuned just at
that time (Didn't even know what Just was). all I knew was that I needed
different harps for each key.
	Is it difficult to tune harps for custom requirements? I wouldn't
mind switching for keys and modes, if I could have my harmonics and
subharmonics too!
For Harmonic Series,
How about:

Blow:

G C  E  G  Bb C  D  E  F+ G
6 8  10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24


Draw:

Bb D F+ A- B  C# Eb F- G- G#
7  9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25
