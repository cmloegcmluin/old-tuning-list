I would think that it would be fairly easy to cut the tubes that valve tubes,
and easy to lengthen them (since you have a slide anyway).  

   I would imagine that you'd want to think about having a larger number of
valves as well.  You might, for example, want to have separate second valves for
1/19 down and 2/19 down (second valve is half-step down, right?  Sorry, I'm more
of a woodwinder).  

   Four methods of managing this sort of thing pop into mind:
1.  A second second-finger valve next to the existing one (i.e., closer vs. 
    farther from the palm of the hand, not closer vs. farther from the other 
    valves).  That's probably not a good idea from the perspective of changing
    fingerings in that it would be very difficult to switch from one valve on
    the same finger to the other.  
2.  Increasing the tuning differences of alternate fingerings (e.g., making 
    first and second play 4/19 down and third play 5/19), and not necessarily
    increasing the number of valves.
3.  Add a second set of left-hand valves for similar 1/19-separated pitch 
    relationships.  Obviously this wouldn't work too great for the horn.  
4.  Give the valves two or more levels (e.g., press second valve down until you
    bottom-out onto the relaxed setting of a second spring to go down 1/19, and
    then depress that second spring down 2/19).  Or if the springs can be made
    light enough, it may be possible to make a valve that can be pulled up or
    pushed down.
