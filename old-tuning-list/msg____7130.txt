Subject: mac-kb for partch

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.or.jp>

Hi!
BUYO-BUYO-IGOR had uploaded a MAX patch to
play Partchy tuning things with Mac's keyboard:
http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~buyobuyo/nisanisa/cpartch.zip
there's no DOCs so maybe hard to find out witch note is where..
..and when recording...the bend data seems to be not correctly saved..
does somebody want to try this one?
