Subject: ears and music (or sound)

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Paul...Haverstick here...I'll take the bait, and just in time to
quote from the November 1997 of GUITAR mag. You mentioned in your last
post that "once you shut off your ears, the whole effect disappears."
Yikes...check this out (from GUITAR)..."The Army and Navy have been
developing acoustic weaponry, wherin audio frequencies can be tuned to
lethal levels."   Later, it says a certain company   "has built a device
designed to make human internal organs resonate with results ranging
from a simple shudder to intense discomfort to death." Of course, this
may not be "music," per se, but it is sound, and music is sound, and
this devilish device obviously bypasses the ears to really reach folks
in a deep and profound way.
    I am not trying to be cute here at all...my concept of music is very
broad, and does not just include what we hear with the ears, or even what
exists on this planet...it is, needless to say, an awesome Universe,
and the potential fo what "music" is most likely goes way way beyond
our Earthly experiences. As well, yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda
have taught methods of meditation that involve listening for internal
sounds that may very well bypass the mechanisms of the inner ear. Far
fetched? I don't think so...my inner hearing has changed drastically
over the last 20 years, and I know I hear things that are not part of
the "external" world. One's personal belief system certainly affects
the way they percieve art, or life in general. Again, my concept of
music is a part of my overall concept of life, and my life view is
that we humans are a teensy weensy part of an unbelieveble Creation,
with potentials beyond, perhaps, what we have traditionally been led
to consider. I enjoy these discussions, as they enrich my mind and
spirit...Hstick
