This is why traditional music 'theory' should be renamed music systems,
as there is really no theory at work at all.

Right!  Music theory, now in its liberated (& real) definition, is alive
and well, as it should always be.  As composer/performer/theorists,
we propose a theory (involving tuning, structure, purpose, etc.) that
then demands music be composed in an attempt to work out the ramificaitons
of the theory.  We then must perform this new music in a test of the
theory's validity in practice.   Then we refine the theory based on this
test, and try the cycle once again, and again, and ........

Now, if we can just get this idea across to the many traditional
music program curriculum suits....!
