Why don't you just use a regular steel guitar?  A steel manufacturer named
"Cougar" specializes in long necked, non-pedaled instruments.  See
http://www.steelguitar.com/webpix/showpix/atla97px/atla9727.htm for a
picture of Claude Brownell playing one.  I can dig up their address if
you're interested.  Regular 24 1/2" scale steel guitars are available
everywhere.
