True, I know, but I was reponding to the topic, also it's
hard to criticise something without saying its name. Note
that in my examples I used ratio notation.

It's useless for describing music which doesn't stick to 7 
pitches. I'm also trying to argue that much of what is called 
diatonic music actually makes use of progressions which imply
more than 7 pitches, and if played on instruments which are
pitch-adjustable, including voice, the progressions can
naturally lead the ear of the performer to play these pitches.
In these cases, diatonic notation and thinking is worse than
useless; (IMO) it's harmful, because it gives a truncated
explanation of musical reality.

I can agree heartily with a melodic-tendancy basis for 
functional harmony, but there is still the sense of
tonality which is like the reference map that functional
harmony plays over. When you move into "romantic" 
chromaticism as an extension of diatonic thought
with added deceptive resolutions, secondary dominants, 
"distant" modulations, etc. it becomes even more important
to consider the real harmonic areas which these voice 
leading tendancies are leading you into. I suggest that
12-tone chromatic tonal music implies more than 12 pitches
and that a chromatic analysis is just as incorrect and
harmful (by not telling the whole truth) as a diatonic 
analysis is for much of supposedly diatonic music.

Let me recount one of my formative microtonal experiences: the
first 81/80 I heard. In the mid 70's, then-schoolmate Kraig Grady 
introduced me to Erv Wilson and Erv played for me the following 
sequence, 1/1 5/4 5/3 10/9 40/27 160/81, then he paused, and
followed it with 2/1. Believe me, when my ear heard the real
tonic it could tell THAT was home, no matter that my 
diatonic-solfege-trained brain had analyzed "do mi la re so do". 
The fact that the final melodic 81/80 movement was so small 
and yet so clearly correct convinced me by-experience of the 
reality of microtonal hearing.

What I'm trying to say is that even though you may write 
music which you think leads your audience to a "wandered 
tonic", if you follow it with the real tonic, they will 
recognize it. This makes me think it better to call the 
supposed "wandered tonic" by another name, to reflect the 
ear's ability to differentiate, rather than reflecting 
the false assumption at the base of a diatonic analysis.

Maybe that example should be called a modulation rather
than a wandered tonic, or maybe it's all a matter of who's 
listening. All I can really go by is my own ear.
