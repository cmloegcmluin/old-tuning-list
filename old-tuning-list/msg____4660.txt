Subject: Re: re as submediant of IV or dominant of V

From: Joseph  Downing <jdowning@mailbox.syr.edu>

Gary and others have been discussing the problem of tuning the second
degree of the scale.

In my (modestly named) "DOWNING I", I tune the Ds above middle C as the
dominant of V, and the Ds below middle C as the submediant of IV.  I just
have to be careful how I voice chords.  I have not seen any reaction from
my students when I move from a chord using the D above middle C to one
using the D below middle C, but, as noted, this means that the shift is
like a subtle false relation in an inner voice.
