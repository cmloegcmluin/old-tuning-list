Tony,

Keyboard music of Sweelinck, Froberger, Frescobaldi, etc. is usually
performed in a shade of meantone. I am not aware of many works that
prescripe a specific temperament. There are some modern works like these

Gyo"rgi Ligeti: Passacaglia ungherese (1/4-comma meantone) for harpsichord
Jean Lesage: Les unite's discre`tes (Werckmeister III) for 2 harpsichords

which are originally for a certain tuning.
