Subject:  a mess

From:  PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com

Right now I have duplicate posts, missing posts, digests with the same
number and different contents . . . Just when I thought there was some
real progress being made in some discussions I was having, the condition
of this forum made it difficult to continue those discussions. I know
David Madole is doing everything he can to fix these problems, but for
now I will wait a while and see how many my of previous attempts at
posting ultimately succeed.
