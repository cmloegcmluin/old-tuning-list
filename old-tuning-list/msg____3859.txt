You can do any equal tempered scale including Carlos style alpha, beta and
gamma  non-octave repeating scales by using KEYMAP tuning in combination with
finer PITCH modulation.  For 19 tone equal temperament, set the KEYMAP Key
tracking to 64 cents per key.  That leaves an additional -.84 cents per step
to be detuned.  Go to the PITCH menu page, set source 1 to BKeyNum (a
parameter that tracks the MIDI key number from -1 at MIDI key #0 to 0 at MIDI
key #64 to +1 at MIDI key #127) and set the depth to -.84 x 128 steps =
-107.52.  The closest value you can select is -110 cents on the K2x00.  This
gives a tuning accuracy of (110 - 107.52) / 2 = 1.24 cents over the entire
MIDI note range.  Finer accuracy can be achieved by using modulation source 2
or one of the four functions available per layer.

Actually, the key tracking resolution for KEYMAP varies, from 1 cent near 100
cent/key tracking to 5 cents and worse the further you get away from 12TET. 
But using additional pitch modulation can overcome that limitation.

You can interactively select the intonation tables by using the Data Entry
Alpha Wheel or the Plus/Minus buttons while you have the Master Page
Intonation Table selection parameter highlighted.  This works realtime
without glitching.  It's also a short 9 byte sysex message to achieve this
from your sequencer.   These changes would take effect globally rather than
per instrument as on the EPS series.

I've never heard of such a beast.  It wouldn't work on the K2500 which has
different sysex than the K2000.  I agree, by the way, this method is VERY
cumbersome.
