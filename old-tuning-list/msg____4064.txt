Subject: LetterBox Video Keyboard

From: curley@ucla.edu (Doren Garcia)

Fellow MicroNauts,

Gary Morrison's comment on my video keyboard suggestion:

Letterboxed and Flat screen monitors are already available and I understand
that flexible monitors are a possibility. I suspect that software or laser
detectors might solve the velocity question.

During the past year Moore's Law ( ie. processor speed doubling every 18
months) was trashed as processor speed doubled in approx. 6 months and it
seems probable that  Exponential PowerPC chips @ 533Mhz will be available
in Mid 1997. Exponential claims that this chip design is scaleable
to...26Ghz!!!

Let us not be to ethnocentric. India is poised to become a software giant.

Perhaps we are setting our sights to low.
