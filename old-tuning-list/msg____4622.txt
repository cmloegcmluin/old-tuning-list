The same minor triad can also be represented as 1/6:1/5:1/4. I've done this 
experiment millions of times, blindfolded, and with a sustaining tone on my 
synthesizer, using headphones, I always get 10:12:15:17. It would have been 
nicer theoretically if I got 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7, but no, 10:12:15:17 sounds 
right, and 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7 sounds wrong.

Tuning the strings of my acoustic guitar, assuming I already tuned a 
10:12:15, I _do_ end up with 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7. Amazing, but true. From a 
theoretical standpoint, this chord minimizes beating between overtones, 
while the 10:12:15:17 exhibits "fusion" or a blending into a single 
sensation. Approching this latter chord slowly on the synthesizer, one hears 
beating in the low frequencies gradually coming to a halt. This probably has 
something to do with eliminating beating between the virtual pitch and the 
difference tones. The latter are less pronounced on the acoustic guitar, 
which is however rich in overtones.

It is these sorts of experiments that lead me to quarrel with Daniel Wolf 
about his use of sine waves, which would invariably lead to the 10:12:15:17 
solution, and never to the subharmonic one.

Incidentally, there is another important tuning of the minor 6th chord, 
6:7:9:10, but only in 12-equal is this the "same" chord.
