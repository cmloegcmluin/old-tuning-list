   Bells are a totally different matter entirely from flutes, oboes, or
other woodwinds and strings.  True, none of them have mathematically exact
integer multiple partials, but bells are many many times further from
harmonic than woodwinds and strings.  ''

While the absolute deviation from the interger series is greater in bells
than in woodwinds, the smaller absolute deviations actually encountered in
woodwinds are - as equations - no less complex.

Gary's observations that synthetic instrumental sounds with integer
harmonic spectra are satisfactory substitutes does illustrate how other
aspects of sound - particularly the envelope - may be equally or more
critical to our recognition of a sound. 

Since I was around at the start of this discussion, let me reiterate that
while I find the integer series to be the best available model, real
instruments do deviate from this model (some more than others) and that it
might be _useful_ to a composer to investigate the deviations. The claim
that another model is more correct - Mr. Lucy's - would need to be
supported in a way that decisively demonstrates an advantage over the
integer model. He has been unable to do this and, I suspect,  has in fact
misunderstood why his tuning might provide certain attractions. At the
moment, the difference tone sequences of Erv Wilson provide a more
convincing rationale for this entire family of tunings, of which Lucy's is
but one in an indefinite number. Beating frequencies are indeed an
interesting line of research, particularly in the psychoacoutical domain,
but the best way of going about this work is not to start with a single
model - i.e. Harrison - and try to prove its superiority but to try to
define the advantages of particular beating rates and then determine the
tunings that best support these rates in a musical context. The Harrison
tuning might just happen to turn up somewhere in such a study, but I would
not hazard a bet on it!
