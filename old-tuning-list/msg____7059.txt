Subject: What I use for microtonality...

From: Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

I'm a little late posting this, but here's my 968.83 cents:

1. Korg 05/RW - I use this mostly, 1200 cent resolution.

2. EMu Proteus Orchestral module - the resolution isn't as good
as the Korg, I don't even have it in the rack right now.

3. mid-'70's Gibson L-6S with a Roland synth pickup - I use
this for controlling the Korg. I've also been ear training
with Cakewalk, sine tones, a glass slide and an E-Bow. Handy
for open tunings too. Used with a pair of silver face early
'70's Fender Princetons.

4. There's a brand new fretless/nutless G&L S500 (read Strat) shipping
today from Manny's, NYC. It should show up here sometime in the next
few days. In a few weeks it will be fretted for 13 limit just
intonation (my own tuning). Let me know if anybody's interested
in getting in contact with Jon Catler at Mannys to get a frettless
guitar. I'll hook you up with his email address if you need it (It IS
on his Freenote records web page). Why use a krap guitar when you can
get a new fretless with a quality neck?

Sharing this info with the list is one thing, but I'm
not interested in getting my brains blown out when someone
forces me into my apt. at gun point to rip off my equipment.

Think about it a bit. Leave my list off your web page.

       .... a sporadic update of changes to our site ....
                       http://corporeal.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Date: January 20, 1998
News: New home, radio show, concert, bits...

Well, it has happened, as you might notice in the header and
footer: we have a new home! Corporeal Meadows has officially
moved to it's own place in e-land, and will henceforth and for-
ever live at corporeal.com.

No, I couldn't hack a complete re-design. In fact, I *hope* I
moved everything correctly, so if you ever notice a bug, let me
know. We *do* have all the sound files back in place, and over
the next few weeks I'm going to start tweaking the sound since
we now have a RealAudio server. Zam!

I'll keep the old site up just a bit longer, and then keep some
files pointing to the new one, so no one gets lost out there...

              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*FLASH* If you don't go to the site, here is something from Dr.
Blackburn:

"For those of you who haven't heard enough of me already of late,
please turn your knob to National Public Radio's Weekend Edition
this Sunday morning, Jan. 25 (times vary from region to region,
but usually 8-11 am).  There you might hear me natter on about
my new book on Harry Partch: Enclosure Three (qv below).  It is
up to the editor and the razor blade to make me sound stupid or
brilliant."

In honor of his shilling, I've got a new tribute to Enclosure 3.
You kids are smart; you'll find it...

              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is about it. I've got notice of a concert in April on the
site, and will be making more improvements over the weeks to
come. We all sincerely hope this will bring more of Partch's
work to the public, and help us all understand what it was and
what it will be. Let me know any thoughts you have...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Don't want these updates? Just let me know and they're gone...

See you on the Meadows!
Cheers,
Jon
