Subject: "Intelligent" harmoniser & microtonality ?

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hi All,

I'm curious. Has anyone here tried using "intelligent" harmonisers,
such as Eventide's H-3000, etc. to achieve microtonality with 
guitars ? I read somewhere that these things have a finetune parameter
for the harmony part, in cents. (Of course I could be wrong, and the 
fine tune resolution could be much coarser.)

Theoretically, this would imply that by shutting off the unprocessed 
guitar sound and using only the effected part, one might achieve some
alternate tunings.

Regards,
Drew
