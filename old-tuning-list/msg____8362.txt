Subject: New software synth

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

There is a really cool new software synth available free(still in Beta
tho) called AudioMulch.  It is kind of like a virtual modular synth, but
it has some unconventional things.  The one that might be very useful to
people on this list is the harmonic generator.  It is a module that
generates the first 10 harmonics above any frequency.  You have a separate
amplitude control for each harmonic.  You can use as many modules as your
hardware allows, so the possibilities are many.  YOu can save what you
make as wave files.
I am not sure what the URL is offhand, but a simple search should yield
it.
