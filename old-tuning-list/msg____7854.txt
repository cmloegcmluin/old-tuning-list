OK, I guess this one was directly addressing me as well!

A computer. Is there anything else that seems ambiguous?

No, certainly not alike. But I guess I should have said something in the
paper about how in 12-tone equal temperament there is one and only one
way of approximating any consonant ratio, and that is a property that
adds a degree of simplicity that  musicians mayt be happy to give up.
