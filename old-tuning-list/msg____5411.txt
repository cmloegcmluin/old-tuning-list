John Pusey: I very much appreciate your setting up and maintaining a
Xenharmonikon WEB page. Thanks again...

I just got the latest issue of Experimental Musical Instruments from
Bart Hopkin. The cover article is by John Gzowski about his microtuned
instruments such as the Cat's Cradle. An article by Rainer Linz discusses 
Percy Grainger's experimental microtonal instruments  and Mitchell
Clark has an article on Ptolemy's HELIKON.

Other articles of note are on new keyboard patterns, sirens, Robert
Rauschenberg, brass instruments, and more circuit bending 
from Reed Ghazala.

This is a strongly recommended issue which is full of items of interest
to tuners.. A list of WEB pages lists MicroMegas http://
www.teaser.fr/~daschour/micro.html, and Dwain Wilder's flexifrets, 
an adjustable tuning system at http://www.servtech.com/public/dwilder
(not yet visited). EMI's WEB page is http://www.windworld.com/emi

Brian hasn't sent me anything to post for him for some time. As far
as I know he is working on a large cycle of piano (timbre) pieces in 
various ET's and his micrtonal bibliography.

--John
