   I guess only Neil can answer to his intentions, but I personally have
never gotten the feeling that he's trying to upset anybody.  I think he's
just trying to say:
1.  Sure, theory is valuable, but what ultimately matters is music.
2.  Practice before you publish.  People will think microtonality is a bunch of
    idle mathematical chatter if the music we publish based upon those ideas is
    boring, even if for reasons unrelated to its microtonality.
