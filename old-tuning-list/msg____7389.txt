Subject: MicroFest West on April 19.

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I just received a flyer for John Schneider's LA MicroFest 
in the mail today. MicroFest will take place on Sunday, 
April 19,1998 at 7:30 PM at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, 
CA (Pierce is a campus of the Los Angeles Community College System).
The program features Johnny Reinhard (microtonal bassoon), 
Sessi Tehrani (Persian santur), Sasha Bogdanowitsch (voice), 
John Schneider (well-tempered guitar), George Zelenz (tubulong 
chimes) and Just Strings (guitar, harp and percussion). Microtonal 
music by Lou Harrison, A"vo P"art, Sasha Bogdanowitsch, Harry 
Partch and others will be performed. For more information, call 
(818) 719-6476.

I urge anyone in the So. California area to attend this concert,
if at all possible. There aren't many opportunities to hear
live non-12 music outside of New York or Boston and Schneider's
efforts should be supported. Also, it's a good opportunity to
see and hear (!) members of the Alternative Tuning List.
