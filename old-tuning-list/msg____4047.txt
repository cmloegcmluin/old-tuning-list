Subject: Re: musical typesetting on the web?

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

There is one - Cubase Score outputs in Adobe Acrobat format
and there is a free viewer for that format. But, it's not much
use even to me, as there is no provision for additional symbols,
let alone for non-12 notations. (And it's copy protected as though
it were the crown jewels with a Mac system that sounds like it
gives the odd nasty surprise on PC's.) It's one reason why I gave
up the notion of publishing music (Scarlatti) on the net, and
have returned to sound recording. If you are VERY byte-techie
inclined, there is a MusicTex system, but I haven't been
able to find a reliable viewer for Tex.

Has anyone found anything better?
