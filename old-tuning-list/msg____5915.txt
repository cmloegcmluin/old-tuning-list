As I often find myself doing, I'd like to second Neil's most recent
request:  I too think it would be great, if somebody can spare a half hour
or so, to briefly list the essential underlying concepts, and summarize at
least some of the discussion that has gone down about them.  Even though
I'm at least fairly familiar with many of these underlying concepts, to be
honest with you, I've gotten rather lost in the myriads of messages as to
what, if any, conclusions have come of them.

   On a related note:  I found Neil's suggestion that the purpose of math
"seems to be explaining the Universe in terms of various numerical
balances" curious.

   I personally think that a better way to view musical math is as a
modeling tool:  Once you choose a concept by which you quantify some aspect
of musical perception, math gives you a "bag of tricks" to apply that
concept in ways that aren't otherwise apparent.  For example, once we
accept that our ears perceive pitch changes as multipliers of frequency,
the mathematical principles of logarithms and exponentials tells us what
that multiplier is for a 12TET half-step.
