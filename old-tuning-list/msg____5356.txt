Subject: Re: TUNING digest 1056

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

If only the 81:80 is a syntonic comma, then only the 3:2 is a (perfect)
fifth. We don't restrict the latter that way; there's no reason I can see
to restrict the former either. But of course it's necessary to specify
whether you mean just (as in 81:80) or not. The context usually 
determines; in any ET, it's obvious.

On a separate matter entirely: some months ago I posted a note to this 
list regarding an acquaintance nearby. He has been working for some time 
on theories of srutis and their tuning and has produced a few papers 
which he wanted to share with others knowledgeable about Indian tuning 
theory. A response came forth, and I sent his papers to the people 
responding (it was a pair under one address). To date, many months later, 
they have not written to my acquaintance or to me and are not on the 
tuning list any more.

My acquaintance wishes to try again. He wants some feedback on his
attempts, which I believe deserve such. So if there is someone who is
willing to have a look at some of his writing (it's not extensive), please
tell me. But please also be prepared to follow through! No specified time
limit, but if you're stuffed with things to do and can't see a response
until the fall...maybe better not. 

Further enquiries off-list please, and thanks to all those Indian music 
experts on the list!
