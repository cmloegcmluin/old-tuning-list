-- and retirees, and a great new music festival every year.

But here's another musical connection -- Peter Yates, the author of a very
insightful and readable history of 20th century music and the founder of
the influential Evenings on the Roof and Monday Evening Concerts in Los
Angeles, made the trek on foot to Ojai from San Bernardino in the 30s to
seek enlightenment from Krishnamurti. The story is recounted in Dorothy
Lamb Crawford's book _Evenings On and Off the Roof_. I don't have the book
handy to recount what it says exactly, but I think he got more out of
working in the lovely mountians than from Krishnamurti himself. He then
returned to the city, moved to LA, and began the famous concert series. He
was, by the way, an early and enthusiastic supporter of Lou Harrison, among
others. His book (published in 1967) begins with essays on the nature of
sound, including a lot on temperament and just intonation.
