   Here are the latest addresses I have for each of the contributors.  If
they are incorrect, let us all know:

Stephen James Taylor;  1948 Estes Rd.;  Los Angeles, CA  90041;  USA

Warren Burt;  6/17 Broadway;  Elwood, Victoria  3184;  Australia (This
address is
    probably the least likely to be correct)

John Starrett:  (I have no mailing address for John, but check out his web
page if you
    haven't already:
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html.  Perhaps
    he has ordering information there.)

Bill Sethares;  2001 Covnent Place, #1;  Nashville, TN  37212-4210;  USA
(I think
    Bill is back in Wisconsin now, so this is probably NOT correct)

Neil Haverstick;  P.O. Box 150271;  Lakewood, CO  80215;  USA

Richard A. Sanford;  50 West 34th Street, #12A4;  New York, NY  10001;  USA

Ernie Crews;  816 County Road 11;  Golden, CO  80403;  USA

Bill Alves;  813 N. Second Street;  Alhambra, CA  91801;  USA
