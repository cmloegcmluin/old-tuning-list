I know, he should've said:
        "... so they're tempered".

Or, if translated from "English" to "Valley Speak":
        "... so they're TOTALLY tempered".
(I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley.)

I actually discovered the same effect when I translated a web page of mine
to German, and then back to English, via AltaVista's Translator.  But you're
right, the "Transmorgrafier" link you gave is a much more efficient way to
waste time.
