Subject: More Equal Temp. vs. Just Int. MIDI files available

From: Mark Nowitzky <nowitzky@pacificnet.net>

Hello again, fellow "tuning@eartha.mills.edu" subscribers and friends!

Back by popular demand, I have created more example MIDI files demonstrating
the difference between Equal Temperament and Just Intonation.  I had been
meaning to write about it for some time, but the appended email from Ed
Dotson gave me the extra motivation I needed (Thanks, Ed!).

To hear the new examples (the first 3 steps are the same):

1)  Go to my home page, "http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky",
2)  Go to the "Interests" section,
3)  Select "here" in the sentence "Click here for an explanation",
4)  Down near the bottom of the "Just Intonation" page, select the link
entitled "The" Dominant Seventh Chord (under "For more fun"),
5)  Either read all my "blah blah blah" explanation, or if you're impatient,
skip right to the bottom and select one of the four example links--"The
first tuning", "The second tuning", "The third tuning", or "Equal temperament".

As always, I appreciate any comments/criticism/suggestions on my stuff.  Be
well, and be "justly intoned"...

--Mark

P.S.:  Ed, I'm using pitch bending, as you surmised.  I wrote a "CAL"
("Cakewalk Application Language") program to automate most of the necessary
calculations.  Thanks again for your email.  --Mark
