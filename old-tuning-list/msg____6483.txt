Subject: Listening to Your Own Music

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

How about a question about music, or perhaps artistry, in general?

   I've heard several musicians, in the sense of both performers and
composers, say that they rarely listen to their own music.  The context and
tone of voice in those statements suggests that doing so would make them
feel vain, like doing so implies that they're giving the impression of
immortalizing themselves.

   I certainly don't frequently listen to my own music, but when I do from
time to time, I often do find it enjoyable.  But not - unless I'm deluding
myself somehow - from the perspective of vanity.  Instead its from the
perspective of reveling in the joys of a completed effort.  Usually these
are efforts that I enjoyed doing, so I relive, in essence, "the good
times".  Perhaps it's kind of like looking at vacation photos.

   Anybody others of you have that sort of feeling from listening to your
own music, or perhaps any other thoughts on that topic?
