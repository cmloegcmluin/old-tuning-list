Subject: Re: More of Septimals

From: alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)

I have tried to remain silent, allowing the wave of Gibsonia to wash by
(perhaps even depositing a few valuables), at least when the discussion
dealt with the arcana of 19 vs. 22 or some such thing. But I have a hard
time letting this pass:

Gregg Gibson:

Why must a musical value be absolute to be artistically meaningful?
Loudness is certainly relative and a spectrum of values. Timbre is relative
along many different axes. In painting, brightness, saturation, and, of
course, the spectrum itself change by degrees, in addition to altering the
perception of each other in context. While there have been some great
painting using only black and white, I would go so far as to claim that the
parameters of media are most valuable BECAUSE they are relative.

It makes no difference to me personally whether you call a 7/6 consonant,
dissonant, assonant, or Gibsonant (tm). A 7/6 is a 7/6, and it has a
particular quality to me that is quite beautiful in a lot of music. It is
certainly not discordant and has no particular compulsion to resolve, to my
ears, though that, too, may depend on the musical context. An
equal-tempered minor seventh has no need to resolve when used in blues
piano music, at least to me. (If you hear its function unchanged from
Mozart, then I can understand why you might dislike blues piano.)

Nor do dissonances always have to resolve. To insist that they do would rob
us of the spice and wonder of Perotin, Bartok, Ligeti, and certain
Bulgarian folk music. Likewise, insisting that a melody must be singable by
amateurs (presumably those trained in the Western tradition, because
Indonesian singers from childhood find the near-septimal intervals of
slendro no problem) is an arbitrary constraint that would rule out much of
Beethoven, Debussy, even rock and jazz. A universe of music of the type
that Mr. Gibson seems to advocate I would find a much poorer place indeed.

Even if I were to concede that Mr. Gibson's conclusions derive entirely
from physical facts as he claims, and not from a selective combination of
acoustics and certain highly debatable and subjective premises about the
nature of music, I would still not accept his conclusion that music must at
least approximate the path that he has found in order to be at all
artistically successful or profound. Does this mean that I have a
terminally open mind? I hope so. Does this mean that I like all music
equally and uncritically? Of course not.

I have encountered many times and can even understand those that believe
that art is ultimately objective, and that anything that fails to fulfill
those objective criteria is "bad art." What offends me, and, I think,
others on this forum, Mr. Gibson, is the implication that anyone who does
not arrive at your conclusion either has not examined your evidence, is
incapable of logical reason, or is intentionally perverse. Or perhaps you
will condescend to express understanding of the unenlightened masses who
still effect the same muddled thinking and wrong ideas that you once did
because of the influence of either the evil hegemony of 12TET or the
aforementioned intentionally perverse xenharmonicists.

Music to me is not about following acoustical norms. It's about exploiting
one's (learned or intuitive) knowledge of acoustics, psychology, and
culture towards artistically expressive ends. Sometimes that means working
"with" or sometimes "against" acoustics, but thank goodness that human
expression is so rich that it can provide us with truly moving art in such
a wide variety of musical systems.
