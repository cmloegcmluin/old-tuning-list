Thanks for replying.  I'm afraid I'm waaaaay back at Tuning 101.

Would you (or anybody on the list) mind elaborating scale construction base on
partial frequency formulas?  i.e., Given the really neat partial freq ratios
that mclaren described, how do I construct a scale from them?

I realize that we can do NonJust Equal Temperament, Just Non Equal Temperament
(what others are there?).  There also seems to be the option of octave
transposition.  For the harmonic series, and the cylindrical vibration mode
series, transposing partials somehow into an octave seems really important,
because the series increases too rapidly to construct a scale merely composed
of partials.

For 12TET, did someone merely lay out the harmonic series to some order, octave
transpose them, and then make a best fit to a 2^(n/12) scale (discarding
partials 7,11,13 in this case)?

Thanks a bujillion,

Marcus
