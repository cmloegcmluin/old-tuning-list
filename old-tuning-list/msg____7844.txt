Shoulda been a little more specific.I meant being able to actually tune a 
synth for real-time use using Hertz.Each MIDI ch. would have one precise 
note.I'd like to be able to hear ,in real-time,the result of  generating 
random/specific frequencies using computer programs.etc.

I have considered them.They allow increments of  @0.1 Hz (by my calc.) 
,so most notes would be a little off.

It was David First's contributions,starting in TD-1391,that seriously 
started me thinking about this.

While actual human ability to recognise  differences in pitch may be 
limited ,I think it is more extended when dealing with psychoacoustic 
efx.Such as if one were using individually tuned multi-tap delays mixed 
at a low level with reverb.

Besides the fact that I find MIDI annoying  in general, I specifically do 
not think in terms of ,and do not work with Cents.MIDI is like thinking 
in English,but having to translate to and from Latin before actually 
speaking.Leaving something to be desired in the end result.

Also,if the approach  actually works,used Yamaha FM synths are a bargain.
