We tune them to anything we want.  The tubes are both hanging
and horizontal, with a special holder designed for groups of
six horitonzontal tubes.  I have about three octaves of these,
tuned in just intonation, with 75 tubes in the middle octave,
and a few less in the outer octaves.

If anybody wants to try a few tubes, contact Woodstock Percussion
in West Hurley <, New York.  I got my custom-made tubes through
Stacy Bowers, who is sometimes difficult to reach since the
company has become so large (I got mine in their early years
when they were a samllmall operatoion with just a few people).

Best,

Lydia
