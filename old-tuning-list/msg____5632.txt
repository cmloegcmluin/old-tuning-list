Subject: Indian music - Levy book

From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

I've been catching up on the list and found this post from last March:

>work on the tuning of Indian music is by Mark Levy: Intonation in North
>Indian Music. Unfortunately, it is published by a New Delhi publisher and

[frp, om Bill Alves]

On my recent trip to the States, I found this book at Theodore Front
in Van Nuys, California.   for US $38.50.  (I can't give the exact
citation because they're shipping it and I probably won't get it
for a couple of months.)

I think I got the only copy on the shelf, but they could order it and
they have email, tfront@earthlink.net.

Best,

Lydia Ayers
