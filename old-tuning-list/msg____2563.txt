   For whatever it's worth, I would imagine that a perhaps more interesting
criterion would be ETs with fifths off by no more than, say, 1/6 of their ET
step size.  That would, in essence, measure their efficiency at nailing a fifth
beyond brute-force by sheer number of notes per octave.  

   Anybody care to give that a whirl?  I'll guess that the list is fairly
similar for the most part.
