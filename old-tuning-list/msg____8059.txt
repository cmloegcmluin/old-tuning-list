Measurement in ratios would likely be difficult to implement unless the tuning
were set up by ratio, and really not necessary for non-rational tunings.
Though it would be interesting, it's really not the purpose of a synth tuning
table.  There are probably programs available to do the calculations for those
who want to know that information.  Actually, I think the Hypercard JICalc,
downloadable for free from the Mills site, can do that; only for Mac, though.
(BTW, if you have access to a Mac and haven't yet gotten the JICalc, do it
now!)

What might be nice is the ability to enter tunings into a synth table via
ratios of up to a certain limit - 4095? (one less than 2^12).  Heck, most
software today is 32-bit, why not ask for 4,294,967,295?  Maybe that's
overkill - OK, a 16-bit calculation would yield 65,535-limit ratios; that'd do
for me. :-)
