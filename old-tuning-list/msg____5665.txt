Subject: Re: Temperaments/tyros/neophytes

From: Joseph  Downing <jdowning@mailbox.syr.edu>

I have noticed people talking about which temperaments are used by
singers and instrumentalists.  I think that there is a misconception.

Temperaments are only necessary on those instruments which are tuned prior
to playing.  Those instruments which are tuned AS they are played will
always search for beatless intervals (or as close as time and skill
allow.)

The brass sections in any major orchestra are very good at finding just
major thirds, for instance.  You'll find that the gorgeous full sound of a
low brass section usually occurs when the tuning is as close to just as
the skill of the performers allows.

Likewise, I don't know of any choir that could conscientiously sing in
'werckmeister III' or 'Vallotti.'  They simply listen to each other, and
find as beatless a sound as they can get.

String players tune to PERFECT fifths, rather than tempered fifths, with
one exception: some cellists (and fewer violists) will tune to tempered
fifths in chamber music featuring a piano.  This is because their low C
string is three fifths away from their tuning note of A, and the
difference between the C which is three fifths lower than A, and the
tempered C is quite noticeable.  (Schoenberg did ask that his string
players tune to tempered fifths, but I don't know anyone who does this
now.)

I reiterate: Tempering is only necessary for those instruments which are
tuned prior to playing (keyboards,fretted instruments.)
