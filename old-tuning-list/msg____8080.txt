It contains three mistuned 5-limit intervals, so it is a mistuned 5-limit
chord.  It can't be translated consistently into JI, like the 'magic
chord' in question.  Which is why you gave it as an example, remember?

No, it argues _for_ what you said, which is why you gave the example.

This is the point I disagree with.  You seem to be saying that the
closeness to 10/9 makes the tone more dissonant.  I say it is the amount
by which it deviates from 9/8 that is important.  The interval does sound
worse than a 5-limit one with similar mistuning.  I suggest this is
because mistuning adds dissonance to an interval, which will be more
noticeable the more dissonant it is to start with, until it becomes so
dissonant as to be incomprehensible.

Maybe "incomprehensible" isn't the right word there, but hopefully you
get the idea.

You provided the analogy, I provided the argument.  Naturally I give the
counter-argument as well.

Golden and 1/5 comma meantone (or 43-equal) are roughly as good in the
7-limit.  So, any difference in this chord is likely to be a result of
the poorer 9-limit approximation to 9/8.  Between 31-equal and golden
meantone, it is less clear.  I generally find the 4-6-9 chord works in
31-eq, but not in golden meantone, suggesting the 9/4 is well enough
tuned in 31-eq, but not in golden.  However, I find 7-limit harmony
usually does work in golden.  So, if this chord is poor it's probably
because of the 9-limit interval.  To confirm this suspicion, I did this:

>>I find that G-Eb-A-C# and Eb-G-C#-A sound better than A-Eb-G-C# and
>>Eb-A-C#-G in 31-eq.  In golden meantone, they all have roughly the same

>Come again?

That should have been 9/5 rather than 10/5.

If you stretch the tone to be a major 9th, it will be interpreted as a
9/4 rather than a 20/9.  If you make it a minor 7th, it will be a 9/5
rather than 16/9.  So, inversions with a major 9th should sound better
than those with a minor 7th if the 9-limit approximation holds.  I think
this is the case in 31-eq, although this is all subjective.  To be sure
it's the approximation to 9/8 and octave equivalents that's making the
difference, I tried in golden meantone, where the tone approximates the
less consonant 10/9 better.  Then, there was no contrast in dissonance
between the inversions.  So, the 9-limit approximation is probably
relevant in 31-eq.

Firstly, I got sharp and flat mixed up there.  9/8 is flat in 31=, or
sharp in JI relative to 31=.

28/25 is just in the sense of being an integer ratio.

If the other intervals are just, the tone will be exactly 28/25.  We are
tempering the chord so that the tone looks more like 9/8.  If the tone
looks less like 9/8 this isn't a good way of tempering: we'd be better
off in JI.  So, taking this chord in isolation, there's no point in
tuning it to 31-eq.  However, if you have some other reason for using
31-eq, the chord does work.

Now, it may be that 28/25 _is_ perceived as a consonance it itself.
However, considering its proximity to 9/8 I see no way of testing this.

Okay, how about this:

Bb    C     E     C#    Bb
G  -> A  -> C# -> A  -> G
Eb    F     A     G     Eb
                  Eb

Or, in matrix form:

(-1 1 0)     (-5 3 0)     (-7 0 2)     (-7 2 2  0)
(-2 0 1)H => (-5 2 1)H => (-5 2 1)H => (-5 2 1  0)H
( 0 0 0)     (-3 2 0)     (-7 3 1)     (-7 2 3 -1)
                                       (-5 2 2 -1)

(-7 2 2  0)    (-2 0  0 1)     (-1 1 0)
(-5 2 1  0)H ~ ( 0 0 -1 1)H => (-2 0 1)H
(-7 2 3 -1)  = (-2 0  1 0)     ( 0 0 0)
(-5 2 2 -1)    ( 0 0  0 0)

I've tried it in JI and 31, 72 and 46-eq.  It works best in 72=, and also
works well in JI.  It isn't as good in 31=, but still works.  The biggest
problem here seems to be the dissonance of the magic chord.  It works
badly in 46=, because the comma (-5 2 2 -1)H doesn't vanish.  I find the
best way of dealing with it is to tune the magic chord

              (-7 2 2)
              (-5 2 1)H
              (-2 0 1)
              ( 0 0 0)

so the comma is hidden in the chord that implied it in the first place.
However you tune that chord in 46-eq, it's going to be a mess.  In JI, I
hide the comma in the D major chord, but this is too blatant in 46=.

On my guitar, I can only play the magic chord in one of its poorer
inversions in this context.  Then, the contrast in dissonance between it
and the tonic is too great.  So, I throw in a dominant subminor-seventh
chord and that works fine.

If you expand the progression to

Bb    C      C     C#    C#
G  -> Ab  -> A  -> A  -> A  -> Bb
Eb    Eb     F     E     G     G
                         Eb    Eb

The usual syntonic comma becomes important, so a meantone like 31 or 43=
has distinct advantages.
