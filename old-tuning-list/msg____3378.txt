Multiple uses of the same symbol make this confusing or actually 
impossible to figure out. Thanks, though, for the earlier references.

Perhaps someone else would like to explain the precedence of 1:5 over 
3:5. It's fairly clear to me, which does not invalidate attempts to base 
a system on 3:5. I don't know whether something could be concocted to 
include both in all cases.

Blackwood's notation for 16, 18, and possibly a few others isn't 
consistent in potential use on all steps of the tuning. (I haven't his 
work at hand as I write this.) Examining the scales he writes out at the 
beginning of each piece in the 12 etudes should show what I am getting 
at.

Interesting definition, but too narrow for me. I had nothing specific in
mind, although I was thinking of ETs, which behave differently from JI in
many ways, of course. We might tentatively talk about having one and only 
one amount of P5s create a M3. We might even think of proper as having 
only one cycle of P5s. Of course many tunings don't have either of these 
characteristics. And many don't have their best M3 and m3 add up to a P5.

Didn't seem anything to address. I have no theory of fractional 
alterations, especially when they should or should not be used.

Another time, perhaps more detail will be possible. I am fairly busy but 
will try to get to this.

There may be too many fractional parts or such a method may obscure 
something else important if it is the only one used. They may be fine; I've 
proposed some myself. See above comment.

Perhaps that is a code for consistency again. (Acoustical functions?) I
agree that there might be a bizarre number of commas in various bizarre
orders, since everything is currently strange in such cases. All I tried
to do was derive a general system to see where it could be pushed. It is
likely that something else is better in some or even many cases. If so,
I look forward to seeing it.
