All-
	I have made 1 minute Real Audio excerpts from the forum cd available 
on my web page under the Listen to Microtonal Real Audio section. 
Currently I have included myself, Neil Haverstick and Ernie Crews. If you 
wish to give me permission to post your excerpt, please email me 
privately and I will make it available immediately. I tried to use a 
relatively energetic portion of each piece for the excerpts, and this may 
not be appropriate for each piece. If you give me permission to post your 
work and find that you are not pleased with the portion that I chose, 
please let me know, and I can fix it within a day.
