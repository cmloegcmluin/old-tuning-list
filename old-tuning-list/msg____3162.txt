Subject: Choral music in other tunings

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

I don't hear Harrison's _La Koro Sutro_ as being in any kind of noticable 
JI, due to the homophonic texture, etc.  What is really pleasing choral 
JI music (to my ears) is any good performance of Gesualdo, Perotin, Byrd, 
etc.  It's only a vocal quartet, but don't exclude Toby Twining's group 
for pop-vocal JI.  They use overtone singing and extended techniques for 
unique textures.

I sure do love that _Koro Sutro_, though.

By the way, I've just created a web site, which can be found at:
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/absweb
A great photo will be included soon, so check back in a couple of weeks.  
Also included is the list of Partch translations/transcriptions.  If 
anyone wants to link this page, let me know!

Adam
