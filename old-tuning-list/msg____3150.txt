Ya know, speaking for myself, I never really listened to the CD in much
detail with regard to verifying that the tunings are "as advertised", so to
speak.  In particular, not much beyond "yip, that there 53TET cut sure has a lot
of VERRRRRRY microtonal intervals alright".  I just kind a sat back and enjoyed
it.  

   But anyway, I just listened to the track Paul mentioned, and I think he's
right!  I suspect that it's 19TET though.  The final chord pretty much seems to
rule out 17.  But I think I'll have to ... "tenuously" I'll say ... disagree
with his assessment of the opening minor third.  I definitely know what he means
by it sounding a little "off", but I suspect that that's an aberation of the
carbon-arc-lamp brightness timbre of that particular Korg patch.  I suspect that
it's 19 because, unless I've gone deaf, I don't hear a shred of beating in it.
And with that much high-harmonic content I would expect it to sound like
phase-shift city if it were off by any appreciable amount from just.  

   It would not surprise me if, when Ivor recorded a bunch of 17-tone stuff on
that Korg, he tossed in something in 22 or 19 or whatever for comparison, and
didn't announce on the master that he'd changed tunings.  He was always
concerned with comparing tunings rather than sticking with any one, so his taped
letters to me were always switching off tunings.  

   I have this image of the man to come leaping out of his grave and announce to
the world, "Aha!  I was wondering when somebody would catch that!".  Of course
there's the minor detail that he was cremated, but hey, nothing else ever seemed
to stop him when he wanted to accomplish something!  

   But anyway, I'm pretty sure that Paul's right here, and I'd be curious
whether anybody else agrees.  Congrats, Paul!
