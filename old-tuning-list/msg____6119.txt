I'm gratified to have gotten some attention for a while.

For years I was always at a loss to answer the question "What kind of music
do you play/compose?" It is NOT pop, nor is it classical, nor is it truly
that of any existing style, American or otherwise, not even the one called
"New Music". But it does have elements in common with many different styles
around the world. What I have always tried to do is get to the very basic
elements of music and creatively expand upon those principles to produce
something that transcends styles. The result is that it sounds familiar to
almost everyone, but yet it sounds different, too.
        Norman Henry once told me that I play "Exotic Music". I liked the
Sound of that, so we are the "Exotic Music Ensemble".

For those who have not heard us, we use 17 limit extended Just Intonation in
a matrix of nine Harmonic Series scales (1-32) and as many subharmonic
series scales (1-24). We also use lots of odd time signatures and
polyrhythms in our counterpoint. Most of our instruments are homemade
(inspired by Partch). And yes, we take stylistic elements from all over the
world. we also like to blur the distinctions between classical, pop, folk
and jazz idiums. We work with dancers whenever possible.

Best wishes,

Denny Genovese
Director
