Audiophiles,

I'm not sure this little discussion of aesthetics is appropriate for this
forum, but I don't think anyone can stop me so...

For me the enjoyment of music is somewhat like enjoying tastes. For
instance, when you are little, sugar is appealing but as you grow older the
subtle, and actually BAD, tastes of wine and other unusual items become
more interesting.

I mention this because in reading 'tuning' it seems that quite a bit of
discussion revolves around consonance, and how close the thirds and fifths
are in each of the tunings.

Personally, I crave the sour. I have noticed when I go to loud rock shows
that, although the musicians strive to play in key, and tune, what I really
enjoy is the out of twelve sounds among the multitudes of overtones and
feedback. I think I like it sour and bitter with just a little sweet.

I don't know, this is probably just me.

Lately I've been thinking about what Ivor called 'transitionalizing' (?).
It seems to me that the mental sensations created by transitionalizing are
somewhat like taste (like puckering when contemplating lemons or pickles).

I'm not sure EXACTLY what this has to do with Mr. Chalmer's, and Mr.
McLaren's above discussion, but what the hay.

Just heard that 50,000 fans turned out for Michael Jackson's concert for
the Sultan of Brunai. Is anyone familiar with the Resident's 'Theory of
Obscurity'?
