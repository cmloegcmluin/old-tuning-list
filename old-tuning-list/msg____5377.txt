You could use the list of supported synths at http://www.justonic.com.  All 
of these instruments support at least one tuning table, usually to an 
accuracy of 1 to 1.56 cents.  You would be able to retune the notes using 
the instrument's embedded software and display, mapping them to the 
existing equal tempered notes.  Any MIDI sequence would then play back in 
the programmed intonation.

Most choir samples will have beating from the sample looping process, which 
could defeat the purpose of any just intonation demonstration of beatless 
harmonies.  It might be better to use single cycle square or sawtooth wave 
programs.  Be sure to remove any LFO modulation (vibrato) from the program.
