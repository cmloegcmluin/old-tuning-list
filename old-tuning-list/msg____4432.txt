Subject: emotional response

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Recent posts on the deeper emotional and spiritual meaning of tuning
and music have brought up some interesting ideas, and I hope the thread
of dicussion of these issues will continue. 
	This morning I found myself moved to tears by the Bulgarian State 
Television Female Vocal Choir singing Ovdoviala Lissitchkata. This is a 
simple repetitive song for two voices and I was surprised at the intensity 
of the emotion it aroused. This is not the crying in your beer kind of 
emotion you'd expect when Merle sings about the same disaster you're going
through--I don't speak Bulgarian and my life's great at the moment. This
was a response of elation, and at the same time a little sadness. Do
some pieces of music evoke a universal response within a musical
subculture? Is there some underlying resonant structure in our brains
that lets us recognize great music, or respond emotionally to "emotion
invoking" music?
	I have had deep emotional responses to mathematics when I saw for 
the first time some deep connection, but mathematics is somehow 
different. There is more cross cultural agreement as to what is beautiful 
or deep mathematics than there is to music. In mathematics a theorem is 
considered true, and therefore worthy of attention, when it can be proven.
A proof can show the place of a theorem in the larger structure of 
mathematics of some type, and sometimes the structure and tools of a 
proof shows the deep connection between different branches of 
mathematics. 
	Are the realtions between musical structures comparable to 
the relations between mathematical structures? Is a great theme somehow a 
great musical theorem and the musical development of the theme its proof? 

Gettin' all philosophical on ya,
John Starrett
