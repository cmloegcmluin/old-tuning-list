It all depends on the type of information, but, yes, there are ways to make
a CD-ROM readable for both Mac and PC users. Of course, if you're putting
software on the disc, then you have to decide on Mac or DOS (though both
can fit on the same disc -- see below). Likewise if the format of the
documents are particular to one operating system (such as files that have a
Mac resource fork), then the disc (or volume) has to be OS-specific.

However, if you are putting raw sound files or text files that are readable
by either system, then the most straight-forward method is to use the ISO
9660 standard, a kind of "bare-bones" structure that is readable from both
Mac and PC, but lacks the nice amenities provided by Mac HFS directories,
such as long file names, spaces within file names, and icons. Commercial
CDs rarely use ISO 9660 nowadays. High Sierra format is similar.

Another method would be to split your disc into Mac and DOS halves, or
volumes. Such a "hybrid" disc would have all the advantages of the
OS-specific directories. The down side is that you would essentially halve
the amount of space you have.

However, I have heard of people who have had separate Mac/DOS volumes for
their OS-specific stuff, and then a third volume with the raw data
accessible to either. Thus your Mac software would be on one volume, your
PC software on another volume, but both would use the same sound files and
raw text files that take up the most space on the disc. I haven't seen such
a disc, but it sounds like a good idea.

Of course, both Mac and PC should be able to read CD-audio ("Red Book"
audio) off a CD quite apart from the computer data.

While all CD-R software should be able to write ISO-9660 and Red Book audio
their ability to write hybrid discs may vary. These issues are discussed
widely in the cd-publication mailing list (sorry, I don't have the address
handy).
