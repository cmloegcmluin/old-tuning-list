Subject: Tuning opcode in latest Csound

From: jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk

Thank you to a number of you who offered advice.  As a result (or
perhaps ignoring that advice) the latest version of Csoudn (3.44) has
two new opcodes aimed at tunings other than 12ET, which has been built
in from the beginning.
  The first opcode is aimed at even divisions of the octave, and is a
simple extension of the current notation.  The other opcode gves equal
divisions of any interval -- clearly a 12th is a good candidate but so
would irrational repeats like 3.14159 (well actually a rational
approximation).  There are provisions for setting ones own reference
frequency. 
  As an alternative both opcodes can be used with a table of values
rather than equal divisions, so 'exotic' scales could be coded fairly
easily.

As was pointed out the just-intonation folk are already provided for
by division.
