First, let's get some acoustics straight. Beats only occur between tones 
that are very close (within a critical bandwidth) and are never heard as 
musical tones, even when they are rapid enough to match the frequency of 
audible tones. Helmholtz is a good reference for all this, and should be 
quite readable to a 19th century mind like Ray's :). However, at loud 
volumes, nonlinearities in our ears cause "difference tones" as well as 
other, weaker "combination tones" to be heard. So Ray's analysis is 
mathematically valid but applies not to "beats" at all but to difference 
tones. Difference tones are important (Heinz Bohlen believes difference 
tones to be the foundation of all harmony) while matching beat rates to 
scale pitches can have no musical significance whatsoever.

Now, to answer the question, with "beats" changed to "difference tones," I 
believe Erv Wilson's meta-meantone tuning has some difference tones that 
are in tune with each other. It should also be possible to devise meantone 
tunings where some difference tones are in tune with some scale tones. 
Perhaps John Chalmers or Manuel Op de Coul have compiled a list of such 
tunings? The nice thing about meantone tuning, of course, is that re-la is 
what it "wants to be."
