You may wish to consult the most famous of all Indian musical theorists,
Sarngadeva, who says (I quote from Levy, Intonation in North Indian
Music, p. 12:)

"Of them, the first [note] must be made as having the lowest possible;
the second must be made to have a slightly higher sound, without any
intermediate sound possible, since no sound could be heard in between
these two srutis."

He goes on to instruct that the same procedure should be used to form
the entire scale of music. To me, who certainly have no bias in favor of
22-tone equal, this sounds like 22-tone equal.

Innumerable other authorities, both traditional and modern, say much the
same thing. It is true that other authorities give - very slightly -
unequal scales (Ellis, for example), and one, the quite untrustworthy
Westerner Danielou, constructs a highly unequal 22-tone
pseudo-pythagorean system, apparently out of thin air. Ravi Shankar, as
I recall, says he uses 22 pitches in the octave - I don't remember
whether equal, nearly equal, or unequal. Normally there would be no
melodic difference between using a slightly unequal and an equal
temperament, but since the tuning degree of 22-tone equal is at the edge
of the critical zone of 55-60 cents, it could possibly make some
difference in this case.

My own opinion, however, is that while the 22-tone equal does seem to
enjoy some instrumental use in India, the evidence - very scanty,
admittedly - supports 19-tone equal for Indian vocal music. So far as I
can determine - but I am no expert - Indian instrumentalists use a wide
variety of tunings, so if you are confused, join the club. The experts
seem to think that the Indians tried to use something very like 22-tone
equal in antiquity, but under Arab influence (ultimately Greek
influence?) gave it up in favor of pythagoreanism. The attitude of the
typical modern Westerner (at least until very recently) seems to be: why
don't those crazy Indians use God's gift to humanity, 12-tone equal
temperament... uhhh... they probably do... they just don't know it...
