Subject: Continued Fractions ?

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hi,

I've been refering to Edward Dunne's excellent web page 
<www.math.okstate.edu/~dunne/students/Temperament.html> on Pianos & 
Continued fractions.
The section on Continued fractions is fascinating,but I don't quite get 
it.I also wound up on this page ,an intro. to the subject,but still 
don't,<http://www.calvin.edu/academic/math/confrac/theory.html>.
Could anyone explain how one gets from Euclid's Algorithm (for GCD),to 
the Continued Fraction Algorithm ?
BTW,I also found a collection of pages on constants/continued fractions 
on MathSoft's site :<www.mathsoft.com/asolve/constant/constant.html>

Oh,and about microtonality in popular/rock music,I believe Steve Vai had 
a piece on an album a 
couple of  years  ago.I think it was 22-TET ?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Drew
