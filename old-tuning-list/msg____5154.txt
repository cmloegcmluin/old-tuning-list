This is related to the number-theoretic functions small-omega(n) and 
large-omega(n). The small-omega function gives the number of different 
prime factors of n (i.e. each prime factor is counted once, regardless 
of the power to which it may be raised), while the large-omega function 
gives us the total number of prime factors (i.e. if p^n is a factor,for 
any prime p, it counts as n factors). Our limit terminology in tuning 
theory can be seen as an extension of these number-theoretic functions 
into the rationals. The prime-limit of a given ratio is thus related to 
small-omega(n_1/n_2), where n_1 and n_2 are relatively prime, while the 
odd-number limit of the same ratio is related to large-omega(n_1/n_2).

Partch's original odd-number limit terminology seems to be a product of 
its times, and of its creators compositional preferences: one of 
Schoenberg's strategies for justifying his move into atonality concerned 
the historical acceptance of successively larger accumulations of 
thirds, first triads, then 7th chords, 9th chords and 13th chords; 
Schoenberg tried to argue further that such chords invoked successive 
odd-numbered members of the harmonic series, albeit approximated within 
equal temperament (an argument which Partch mercilessly lambasts). Even 
without the harmonic series accretion, the argument is still highly 
dubious, but it had a certain persuasive power in its day (Schoenberg 
wasn't its only advocate). Partch himself was concerned, as a composer, 
in using intervallic structures moving up through successive 
odd-numbered harmonics, although unlike Schoenberg he was determined to 
do the job properly (and as everyone knows, for purely pragmatic reasons 
he chose not to go beyond the 11-limit).

However, the prime-limit modification of Partch's terminology, related 
to the small-omega function seems to have won greater favour, possibly  
because it is more open to generalisation. For instance, how do we 
specify the limit of a fully chromatic 14th-century monochord, or even 
worse, a schismatic 15th-century monochord (i.e. Fb serving for E etc.) 
Both are constructed entirely from Pythagorean ratios, and thus 3-limit 
by the prime terminology; but if we use the odd-limit terminology we 
must say, for example, 531441-limit, even though all odd numbers up to 
this limit which are not powers of 3 are excluded. I notice that John, 
above, suggests adding "odd" for the Partchian limit terminology, 
leaving the prime limit as a default. Have I construed you correctly, 
John?

Perhaps it would be better to use the Euler-Fokker notation, and simply 
list all the primes [p_1,p_2,...p_n] (according to the small-omega 
criterion) that are used in a given composition. Even the prime limit 
terminology can become awkward when, as with some of Ben Johnston's 
works of the 70s, some prime smaller than the limit are not used as 
factors, whereas the Euler-Fokker notation is unambiguous.

OK, now I'd like someone to do me a small favour: could you give me the 
source in Euler for the specification of prime factors in musical 
contexts. Is there a brief English-language account of the Euler-Fokker 
notation? (I'm not aware of anything in Xenharmonikon that fits this 
description.) Or perhaps someone would be kind enough to post a few 
words on the topic to the list. For instance, is the convention to omit 
2 from the list of primes, or to include it? Thanks.
