Being a guitarist I must strongly object. No, the guitar 
(at least classical) is NOT a definite-pitched instrument 
for that matter. Especially in sustained chords we do 
manipulate the individual pitches of the tones that make up 
the chord as to make the sound more pleasant, of course 
also to compensate for non-ideal strings that may be 
slightly out of tune especially when playing high up the 
neck.

However I do agree with you that the sustained chords make 
the bigger impression on the audience which limits the 
argument. Although we (most musicians) cannot play in any 
temerament we choose, at least not up to speed we can 
massage the most important parts just that bit.

Please forgive me if this point has already been made. I 
read the digest version of this list.
