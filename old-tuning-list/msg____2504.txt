Subject: Intriguing 88CET Chords

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

For you folks doodling around with 88CET:

   I just happened upon a couple of really curious-sounding chords.  In my
notation system, they work out to (ascending) A F A D Bb, and A F A F Bb.  The
first one works out to close-voiced a subminor triad with a note a fifth below
the bottom note, and another at tritone above the top note.  It seems to be
especially intriguing in a spacey timbre, like chorused strings.  

   As a refresher, my notation system maps the 11-step 7:4 approximation to what
visually looks like an octave, and skips over the G#/Ab key (i.e., half-step
between G and A).
