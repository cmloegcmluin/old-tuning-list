Subject: Scale archive update

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

There is a new version of the scale archive with 1666 scales now.
Download ftp://ella.mills/edu/ccm/tuning/software/scales/scales.zip .
See also scales.doc.
The scales are in human-readable format and compatible with my tuning
program Scala. Having this archive is useful if you have created a new
scale and want to see if it's already in there. To compare a scale in
Scala against all files do: "compare *". It will find scales that are
modes or inversions of the scale and it is possible to find subsets and
supersets too.
