Subject: MIDI/Audio wish list

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Thanks for all very useful comments John.

Yes, the tuning of library sample libraries is very unreliable.  Of
course, since these libraries are created/edited with the
sampler units, (that is, unless an external reference is used) they
can be no better than the sampler.  So is the argument circular?
Would better resolution therefore have a knock on effect?  Probably
not, since the library makers aren't interested in exact tuning.  The
question (as I see it) is -  is better resolution only needed for
very special purposes, or do a considerable proportion of members of
this list feel it would be valuable? (If the members of this list
don't then surely few will).

Sorry, what's an IC?

Sure.  Too bad microtonalist's haven't got alot of economic clout.
The discussion paper, in a round about way, is aiming to do a tiny
bit about that.

(Aside) Something I've always wondered about is why using pitchbend
from my keyboard (A80) (to the sampler) sounds poor.  But retuning
the sample at partial level sounds fine.  Please excuse my ignorance
of this stuff.

Yes, it's extremely tedious - but my point is that it needn't be,
even on a sampler.  Hence the idea of creating on-board macros or
templates to speed up the process.  The reason why it's not a waste
of effort (for me) is that I'm creating simulations of acoustic
instruments.  The difference between what one can achieve in this
respect on a sampler and a synth is enormous (IMO) - but of course
not everybody is interested in simulation.

Agreed - so would I! And I don't think there's an immutable reason it
can't be done on a sampler! In fact the Roland does have something
which sort of works like this - but not well enough.  Since a sampler
is a kind of relational database, there shouldn't be any reason why,
(given 1998 processors et al) the relational mappings need not be
much more flexible and friendly.  So, (from my view at least, but I'd
be interested to know if others would like this too), it seems
worth arguing that updating the 'database architecture' would be a
great idea for making the best of the  sonic benefits of sampling
(for specific purposes).  But, maybe sampling technology will soon be
(successfully) surpassed - let's hope so.

Great stuff.

Sure. The discussion paper is meant as a kind of think-tank document,
aimed at clarification and encouraging consensus (maybe!).  It's not
a proposal to manufacturers.

Do you mean the Microzone - or are Starr Labs producing another
keyboard as well?  I hope the distinction between what I suggested
and the Microzone is clear.

Thanks!
