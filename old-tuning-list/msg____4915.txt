A quick correction of an error kindly pointed out by Matt Nathan:

I had said, in discussing Aristoxenus:

       log(9/8) + log(9/8) + log(256/243) 4/3

What I should have written, of course, is:

       log(9/8) + log(9/8) + log(256/243) log(4/3)

However, just for the sake of idle pedantry, the first statement is 
trivially true in the single case where (4/3)^(3/4) is taken as the 
logarithmic base.

I'd happily second both of these proposals. Uploading compressed .wav 
files by anonymous ftp to a selected site would seem to be the best 
option, since not all subscribers will have e-mail accounts (or 
software) that can cope with large files.
