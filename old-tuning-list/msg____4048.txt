Subject: K2000 PB Resolution

From: asouter@scf.usc.edu (Andrew Souter)

Friends,

        Well I took your advice and tested the K2000's PB Frequency
response manually.  I used Performer 5.0 to send PB Data to two separate
tracks which played sine waves a various frequencies.  The two tracks were
each given different pitch bend values, and the resulting beats were
observed and recorded manually.  It was a rather involved experiment which
took most of the day, so I will not go into detail, instead I will simply
present the conclusions:

        1.)  The K2000 responses to pitch bend messages in a logarithmic
fashion.  2.)  Unfortunately, regardless of the pitch bend range specified
under the "Commons" page, the maximum tuning resolution obtained by using
the pitch bend method is approximately (or possibly exactly?) 1 cent.  3.)
This fact proves this method to be of little advantage over the Global cent
based method.

        I invite, anyone to challenge these findings;  I certainly would
not be upset to be proven wrong. I hope, in fact, that I may be proven
wrong...

        -andrew

Safe Journey...
