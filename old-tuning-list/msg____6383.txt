Subject: RE: Erlich's Theory

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

Fans of Paul Erlich will no doubt already have read his paper available
through http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html .  A
brave attempt at a theory of diatonic, 7-limit harmony.

Now, back to picking his posts apart paragraph by paragraph:

I don't have Plomp & Levelt's curve to hand, but I do have Kameoka &
Kuriyagawa's.  The minima don't look much like parabolas to me.  I
question this generalisation for physics as well, but that needn't
bother the rest of you.


A Farey series would be like a Partch even limit, right?

I'd guess any function that bears some relation to the overtone series
would produce a qualitatively equivalent curve.  The entropy method
then looks like a good way of going from functions of integer ratios
to a continuous curve.  There are lots of the former, of course -- the
Partch limit, LCM, generalised harmonic distances, or counting the
"filled" partials of the virtual pitch.

It's crucial that a concordance theory be made to work for more than
dyads.  I think here that the entropy method will become rapidly
computationally intensive the more notes are involved.  I would try
this myself, but I've got software to write, and I might get a job
soon, so I don't really have the time ...

As a composer, I feel a theory of chords is more useful than one of
dyads.  Most useful of all, though, is a theory of chord sequences.
This is where lattices come into their own.  As a programmer, speed
and memory are important, so I'm planning to go for harmonic
distances if I ever get around to dynamic tuning.  I think a
Euclidian distance on a parallelogram lattice should include
approximations to both Partch limits and LCMs.


BTW, I had a flanger on when I did my listening experiment before,
which explains the unpleasentness of the 31TET 4:6:7.
