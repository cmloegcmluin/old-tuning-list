The amount of numerical symbolism Bach has put in his music is
astonishing too. Below are some references. Especially the book "Bach
en het getal" (Bach and number) by van Houten and Kasbergen contains
many discoveries. It has a summary in French, German and English. The
conclusions are vulnerable to criticism but intriguing or spectacular,
depending on how convincing one finds the material. I won't write here 
what they are, since it's better not to take them out of the context
in which they are presented. If you are interested in this subject,
lack of knowledge of Dutch shouldn't withhold you from reading it I
think. There is probably much still undiscovered.
