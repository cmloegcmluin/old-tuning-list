Well, now.  My statement above was taken almost verbatim from Grove's 
Dictionary of Music, which also points out the difference between the Ionian 
mode and the key of C Major.  This also agrees with everything else I have 
read on the subject.

You evidently have developed your own definition of "key" - more power to 
you, but without common terminology no discussion is possible.
