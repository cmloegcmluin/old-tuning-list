His position under the Archbishop of Salzburg included organ playing and
his sacred music is far from insignificant.

And:

''   But Mozart wrote lots of piano music, and even by that early a time
pianos were mostly 12TET, right?''

Broadwood claimed - and this must be taken as hyperbole - that 12TET was
standard practice only in 1811. At that time Mozart had been dead almost
twenty years. The most generally accepted date for 12tet as common practice
for piano tuning is about 1844.
