Subject: 9/5 on pedal steel

From: "Bob Lee" <quasar@sonic.net>

Interesting to see discussion of the dominant 7th tone sounded as 7/4 or
even 12/7.  On reflection, I realize the reason that we E9th steel
guitarists tune our D strings to the sharper 9/10 and 9/5 - it gives us an
easy D major triad with the 9/8 F# and the 4/3 A.

That triad is sweet, but our diminished chords are notoriously sour.  I've
realized that I use the 7/4 a lot as a melody note in blues solos, but I
really don't have the pedals set right to give it to me in chords.
