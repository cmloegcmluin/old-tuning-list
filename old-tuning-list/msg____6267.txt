Subject: Re: Guitar refretting

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-

        I have found that the best filler for empty fret slots is either
a mixture of epoxy and wood dust or superglue and wood dust. The super
glue method is the easiest--just fill the fret slot with wood dust
several shades lighter than the fretboard and drip superglue onto it. The
glue will wick into the slot and harden from contact with the wood dust.
You cannot pre mix these, however, and much practice is required to guess
the final color.
        When using epoxy, you can premix to match the color, but beware
of using too little wood dust, because once the epoxy-dust mixture is in
the slot it will appear darker if there is not much wood in it.
        Also, when removing frets it helps to heat them first with a
soldering gun. This loosens glue and makes the wood flexible enough not
to chip when the fret is removed.
        I am preparing a complete guide to do it yourself refretting that I
will
post on my web page
www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html
It will be 2-3 pages long, but if it is of sufficent interest to forum
members I will post it here also.
