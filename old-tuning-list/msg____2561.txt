        The keyboard tempering practises in use between 1700 and 1900,(dates
are automatic flame targets in this subject!), offer physical reasons for
different "moods" to emanate from different key signatures. 
      What I am curious about is whether the differences between keys of,
say, an early Werkmiester, are greater than the differences between the Greek
modes.  
      Plato, I believe, had strong thoughts about the effect different modes
exerted on the developing mind, and in his Republic, I think, stated that
some modes should never be heard, lest the growing intellect be irrepairably
damaged. 
     Any body listen to enough Greek Modes and Well Temperaments to make a
comparison???
