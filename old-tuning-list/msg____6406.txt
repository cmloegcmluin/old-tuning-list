Subject: Erickson's stroke-rods

Daniel, would these instruments be called the stroke-rods ? Are they
played wearing a gardener's glove ? If so then, a set exists in the music
department at Melbourne's Latrobe University, where I think they are still
in use in the improvisation lab. They would have been introduced there by
the late Keith Humble who had a long time association with UCSD where I
believed Erickson worked. These stroke rods have been used in concerts by
the contemporary performing ensemble Flederman, the nationwide Australian
ensemble responsible for much of the contemporary music which flourished
here during the 80's. Percussionist of the group, Graeme Leak would be the
person who would be able to give you the most information. Unfortunately,
I don't think he has email. You could write to him c/o :

	Music Department
	Latrobe University
	Bundoora Victoria 3058
	AUSTRALIA

But if you'd like to confirm details of this post quickly, then perhaps
you could contact ex-director of Flederman, Graham Hair, (who incidentally
has composed in 31-tET). Graham's address is :

	Graham Hair <ghair@nla.gov.au>

Failing that, then closer to home I'd imagine the percussionist
Jean-Charles Francois or the trombonist John Silber would only too happy
to help you with some further leads. Good luck.
