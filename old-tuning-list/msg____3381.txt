Well, I set up my keyboard to play the Pierce-Bohlen scale with a harmonic 
tone having no even partials (i.e., no octaves in the harmonic series). When 
I improvised a melody over a drone bass, trying to emphasize the notes that 
would theoretically be consonant, I found that 33 steps above the bass 
sounded like a resolution while 39 steps above the bass did not. So much for 
the theory of tritave equivalence! Clearly there is a lot more equivalence 
in 16:1 than in 17:1 or 15:1 or 27:1 -- octave equivalence is a real and 
unavoidable phenomenon. My hypothesis is that our virtual pitch sensations 
are quite indistinct as to octave register, even though our pure tone 
sensations (e.g., formant perception, vowel recognition) may be quite 
specific in this regard. The best approximations of the 88CET scale to the 
octave are only slightly farther out than those normally used in gamelan 
music, so perhaps even your generic inharmonic timbre would allow you to 
hear some octave equivalence there. But certainly the tolerability of 
out-of-tune, especially of stretched, multiple octaves increases with the 
size of the interval -- Yasser showed that a rapid atonal passage played in 
a lower register of the piano and doubled in a high register sounded the 
same to his subjects when the upper part was played a semitone higher.
