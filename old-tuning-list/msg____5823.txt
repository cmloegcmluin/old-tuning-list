Absolutely NOT!  I know of no evidence that EQ was any more than a theory
occasionally espoused at that time.  It is just TOO HARD to tune equal
temperament without either a LOT of training, or an electronic device. 

in Mozart's time various well-tempered systems were still in use.  (For
references, somebody help me - the BIG red historic tuning book by the guy
from Michigan - can't recall name and title right now.)  Anyhow, he gives
some tuning 'recipes' from the 18th century; they are NOT equal.
