The resolution of the TS/VFX and EPS/ASR is 768 tones per octave, which is
1.5 cents.  This does get mapped a little strangely from the front panel
display to the internal tuning sometimes.  One trick is to increment
slightly past where you want to tune in and then try decrementing- because
of the mapping you'll be able to get an offset which is between the steps
reached by just incrementing.

I hadn't looked at interpolation that closely but I had tried it out with
many of the standard ETs such as 19 etc.  Can you give a specific case for
the backwards interpolation?  

Manual Op De Coul's 'Scala' tuning editor is currently being extended to
support the VFX and TS.  I've sent him the sysex docs and you would be a
good test subject for this.  Contact him for more info.

The distortion is one of the unfortunate charms of sampling and
interpolating oscillators.  Because it's skipping steps in a wavetable the
number of 'real' samples in the wavetable decreases as you transpose up or
down.  This is why people multisample- that is put a sample in the upper key
range that's playing at a higher pitch so the oscillator doesn't have to
transpose as far.

Aside from these problems, I hope the unit is still useful to you.  Ensoniq
is the one of the few manufacturers of music synths these days which is
producing both affordable and tunable instruments.
