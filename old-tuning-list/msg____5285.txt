Subject: RE: Neanderthal flute

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Though the Discovery article was an April's Fools ploy, the Neanderthal
"flute" is real.  At the recent Flute Conference held in New York,
microtonal flutist Susan Friedlander reported to me that they were leaning
towards a nay-like activater for the cave bear femur.  Additionally, there
are reputed to be bird-bone flutes, a fair number of which were found in
the same location as the femur-flute.

According to the photo in TNYTimes, 4 holes were punched into the femur of
a now extinct cave bear, visually equidistant.  The outside rims of the
furthest holes have decayed.
