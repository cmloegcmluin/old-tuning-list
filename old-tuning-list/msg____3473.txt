Paule, please pardon me,but WHY is the dominant 7th a dissonance? To me 
a tuned 7th is very consonant.

 In jazz in the mixolydian mode, the dominant seventh chord is the tonic 
chord, and tuning it more purely can only add to its tonicity. It can, 
however, make the chord sound out of tune with respect to the scale. 

Do you mean with respect to the tempered scale?

I'm an "ear" singer-listener-whatever. Are you referring to a 7th whose 
tones are in frequency ratios of 4x:5x:6x:7x where x=some fundamental 
frequency? Or am I in over my head and should just go away(g)?
