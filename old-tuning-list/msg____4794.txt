Subject: Truth and Music

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

Is there some one true basis for music? Personally I think of truth as
fundamentally inexpressible. Humanity's noblest effort might be the quest for
truth, but that doesn't mean it's anything that can ever be found. Quite the
contrary!

Similar "quests for certainty" have taken place in mathematics. Is there one
true basis for mathematics? Natural numbers? Set theory? Category theory?
Predicate calculus? 

See Morris Kline's MATHEMATICS: THE LOSS OF CERTAINTY. Mathematics continues,
creative and productive as ever if not more so, despite Goedel, Brouwer, et
al.
