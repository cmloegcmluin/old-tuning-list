Subject: Reply to Bill Alves re: ET

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

Well, I can't think of anything else to write in
defense of my original statement, except to say
read Johnston's article -- it's valuable.

I don't like to defend statements I make about
tuning unless it's something I've really thought
long and hard about, and frankly, ever since
learning about just-intonation in the mid-1980s,
I haven't concerned myself much with ETs.

I will defend my theories of prime "ness",
my belief that we can recognize primes in
music that are far larger than what most
musicians will admit, and will defend the
use of JI in general, but aside from these
three things, I try to stay as open-minded as
possible about tuning.  Strong debates are
always welcome!
