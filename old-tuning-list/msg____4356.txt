   Equal-beating in a meantone framework, yes.  Or, well, almost yes.  Erv
Wilson's meta-meantone has equal-beating between 1-3 and 3-5 of a
close-voiced, root-position major triad, with no doubling, and no notes
omitted.  As Dan Wolf pointed out, LucyTuning is close to, but not exactly
identical with, meta-meantone, so the value behind the pi-based definition
is unclear.  

   The usual 4:5:6 JI version of that same chord is also equal-beating, but
not in a meantone framework as with meta-meantone.  

   As for patenting and copyrighting tunings, Mr. Lucy might want to ponder
whether that approach will backfire on him.  That in the sense that
requiring people to get his permission (and probably pay royalties) to use
LucyTuning commercially is likely to pretty much ensure that nobody will
use it.  There's a lot of "tuner fish" (har har) in the musical ocean.
