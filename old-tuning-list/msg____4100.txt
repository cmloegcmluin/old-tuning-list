Hello, Heinz!

Unfortunately I don't know German, but I would like to share with you the 
article by Pierce, Roberts, and Matthews in _Harmony and Tonality_ 
(proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, edited by J. Sundberg). 
Other articles in the book mention your scale. Randy Winchester has done a 
good job composing/improvising in it. I don't think he uses square waves, 
but Enrique Moreno and I agree that this doesn't matter as much as Pierce 
first thought it would. (Did you discuss overtone structure in your original 
article?) Manfred Schroeder describes "Pierce's scale" alongside "Bach's 
well-tempered scale" in his truly wonderful book, _Fractals, Chaos, Power 
Laws_, and the footnote is to the article "Theoretical and experimental 
explorations of the Bohlen-Pierce scale." J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 84, 1214-1222.

Before I knew of these scales, I had recognized 7-limit chords such as 3:5:7 
as consonant and found a scale (based on normal octaves) from which they 
could be derived. This is described in a paper I am currently completing and 
which will appear in Xenharmonikon 17. I don't believe that major or minor 
thirds were heard, even unconsciously, as anything other than the dissonant 
intervals they were in the early and middle Middle Ages. I do believe, 
however, that triadic harmony makes the diatonic scale easier to use and 
understand, since three (not necessarily all major) complete consonant 
triads do give you the whole scale. My scales have this property as well, 
using complete consonant tetrads . . .

Heinz, what subset of the 13 notes do you feel is the best analogy to the 
major scale? Pierce, et al describe the mode 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 12 (13). Did 
you come up with this?

 -Paul
