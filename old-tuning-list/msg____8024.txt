I will change the description at the web site to "12 note octave scales" to
clear up any confusion.

Most Ensoniq's have an "extrapolate" function that creates a scale in this
manner and compiles it to the full keyboard tuning.  I think that's the
best way rather than having some third method of storing scales, if that's
what you're suggesting.
