Subject: making "GaMa-Oke" together?

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.ne.jp>

SaRiGaMa's Oil Vending Orchestra
would like to propose you to join our "Hz"-links!
This is to  prepare csound "orc&sco"s 
which could be called "BROTHERS" 
by starting from common Hz and making the harmonic movement
between each two "orc&sco"s "www"-oriented.
Well doesn't have to be csound only.......but maybe the smallest file-size oriented
.I guess.

What our orchestra intend is to prepare a "GaMa-Oke" a background "karaoke"
and let it be played at our studio jam thang.:
http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~buyobuyo/gamagama/forgama.html

If you could start from latter root-Hzs....
this will help a lot to let us bind sounds
suitable to our "SONG no.5":
http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~buyobuyo/songs/five.html

207.652
287.519
155.739
241.145
186.887

these all have common harmonics 

233.609 

to make things PD oriented....
I prepared a banner:
<A HREF="http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~buyobuyo/ewhat.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp
/~buyobuyo/songs/cpkeep.gif"></A>

If each participant's www-page contributed for this project (under condition
 mentioned by this banner...) can be linked to each other....this linkage can
 teach the visitor the relationship between material-files and people can download
 his favorites and combine the resulting sound-files of do looping things...

excuse me ..my english is horrible....

BTW.
Any project like this before?
