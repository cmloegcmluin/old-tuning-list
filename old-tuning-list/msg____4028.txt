Well the ethnomusicologists of the last century used a grammophone and glass
plates with soot to measure frequency, be inventive!
I'm kidding, but perhaps you could use a monochord to find out the nature
of the relation between pitch bend numbers and frequency.

If you put the sound through an echoing device with feedback (tape loop,
effects processor, etc.) then you can hear the sound beat with its echo 
if there is an actual change with one unit step.
