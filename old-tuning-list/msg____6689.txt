Subject: Re G. Gibson in TD1265 and on the sensitivity of intervals to mistuning

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

>the prominent beating of out-of-tune ratios of 3 is more disturbing, but
>ultimately it is not as detrimental to the musical meaning of the intervals
>as an equal amount of mistuning in more complex ratios. This latter fact
>explains why 19TET is much better than 12TET for 5-limit harmony; weighting
>the ratios of 3 much more than the ratios of 5 would make 12TET look better.
>One gets used to the prominent beating of the ratios of 3 in 19TET and 22TET,
>and misses it when it's gone. The beating in 26TET is only a shade faster.
