Subject: Change of address

From: Mmcky@aol.com

Greetings to all from a new place.  I have moved from
mmck@delphi.com to mmcky@aol.com.

I did this primarily because Delphi won't let me ftp binaries to
mills.edu.

As of yet, I have not been able to get AOL to let me do that
either, but they do provide an ftp space so their users can
publish things.

The versions of FasTrak that are posted at Mills now go there by
me sending a disk to Manuel in the Netherlands, and him posting
them to Mills.

Needless to say, right after I sent him the last disk, I found a
couple of bugs.  The SCANL.EXE utility hung if it was fed a scale
with two identical tones, and the AH.EXE utility was less than
robust in the face of transmission errors.  These bugs have now
been fixed and the new software posted on AOL.

To get it, FTP to users.aol.com, then cd to the mmcky directory.

I will now begin to post other stuff there as well as I find the
time.

Any bug reports for FasTrak would be welcome.

Marion
