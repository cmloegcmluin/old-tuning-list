If the 7th in a dominant 7th chord is tuned to 7/4, then it loses its
dissonance and instability. Indeed such a chord can function as a tonic
(as it does, quite exceptionally for the time, in Chopin's 22nd
Prelude).

But, in common-practice classical music, and indeed in most contemporary
(not blues-based) pop music, the dominant seventh chord is a chord which
actively seeks resolution to the tonic (usually a major or minor triad a
perfect fifth below) with the seventh resolving down a minor or major
second and the third resolving up a minor second.

It is the unrelatedness of the seventh to the rest of the triad that
makes this such an effective leading tone.

For this reason it is absolutely incorrect to tune the seventh of a
dominant seventh to 7/4 in the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin
(exception noted) etc., because to do so is to misunderstand the
harmonic function of this note, and to give the dominant chord an
entirely different function to that intended.
