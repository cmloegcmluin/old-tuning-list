   Clavichords are so bebung-sensitive that their temperament had to be tuned
for the individual that was playing it.
      The earliest set of instructions that will result in an acceptable equal
temperament seem to have been written in 1830, and even then you have to be
able to divide the octave into three ET maj3rds, and then on top of them, four
equally tempered min3rds.  Sorta tricky.  Bill Garlick, my teacher, has done
it, but it requires a real stretch to think that the average 17th century
instrument builder or repairman would be in the same league.
    Without knowing how to accurately measure the width of a third, it would
be very difficult to tune a 12TET on a strung keyboard instrument.  The tests
required are not found in any of the rather extensive literature before the
mid to late 1800's.  (According to Jorgensen, whom I have so far found to be
fairly well documented.)
