Subject: JI versus eq temp

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...I want to make an observation inspired by McLaren's
post regarding the studies undertaken to see what sort of tunings folks
prefer....while that is an interesting subject, to be sure, the more
important issue, as I see it, is what sort of musical STYLES do certain
tunings fit? I mean, this all gets back to why 12/eq came about in the 
first place...purely tuned scales are, for all practical purposes, very
limited in their applications...as soon as you want to move a lot of chords
around, it's all over for just intonation. Thus, jazz, "classical", most
"pop" music, and many other styles around the world cannot use JI, no
matter what people prefer...if you prefer JI over eq (and, of course,
which eq are we talking about), you ain't gonna be hearing it in bluegrass
any time soon, or just about any other music except modal based stuff.
Sure, Wendy does it on her synths, but that's a lot of complex gear 
which is inaccessible to most musicians...again, in a practical, nuts
and bolts musical situation, eq temps are the only possible choice for
many various styles of music...Hstick
