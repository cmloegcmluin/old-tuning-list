Re: the above subject -

Since I have seen a few questions revolving around this, I am always more
than happy to supply essentially useless information <g>.

There were two LP's, both still sitting in my closet:

- "Journey To Bliss - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band" 
(Impulse Stereo A-9166)

- "Spirit of 1976 - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band / Live at
Donte's" 
(Impulse Stereo A-9182)

To be upfront about it, these are not excursions into microtonal composition
per se;  Emil and company just used microtonal instruments, virtually all of
these percussion (and mostly made by Emil, I think) to add colors to the
music.  They had been influenced by Hari Har Rao, who had recently begun
teaching Indian music in the LA area at the time.  Most of the expansion of
the jazz idiom came in the form of odd meters.  They were also being
influenced by the Maharishi himself (with LP #1 having a particularly
striking oil painting of him on the back), and more than a certainty being
influenced by burning vegetation of an illegal nature (except for medicinal
purposes, of course).  

You probably don't need to check them out as microtonal resources, but if
you want a retro insight into the late 60's (when I believe these were
recorded) they are just the ticket.  Side Two of LP #1 is "Journey To Bliss:
A Meditation Suite in Six Movements".  Priceless stuff, I assure you.

Emil was turned on (hmmm...) to the Indian thing by Don Ellis, and for a
while they had a group called the Hindustani Jazz Sextet.  About that group,
I know nothing.  Maybe Daniel Wolf knows - seems like he was a California
boy back then...

Peace and love, flower-people!
Cheers,
Jon
