Subject: more tuning tables

Gary asked:

>So then they to have completely arbitrary pitch tables (any key may be
assigned any pitch without regard to how any other is assigned)?

yes. Im not sure about all the units by these manufacturers,
but at least the TX81Z (Yamaha) and the Proteus (Emu) as well as
the EPS/ASR (Ensoniq) can assign any key to any pitch
(up to their resolution, which seems to be 1.56 cents for
all these units, though I cannot swear to that).
