Subject: Tuning Digest 1000

From: Matt Nathan <mattn@ix.netcom.com>

Here's my 2.000 cents on the coming arrival of tuning 
digest 1000.

I only found the tuning list at around digest 920, but 
I was participating in unmanifested spirit before then. :)

I thank David Madole and Greg Higgs for starting 
and maintaining the list, and thank the participants 
for filling it with inspiring and educational contributions.

I'd like to suggest two directions for the next 1000 days. 

First: We need a Tuning FAQ. Perhaps it
could be an evolving group effort. I've been thinking
about what I'd like to see in it and what I could 
contribute. The toughest job may be in deciding what
not to let in so that it wouldn't bloat to the size
of a reference library. As a minimum, I think we
need a glossary and an exposition of common 
tuning-notation styles (not the tunings themselves).

Second: If we could find ways to make the exchange 
of actual sounds be part of our communication, it
would raise by orders of magnitude the quality of 
the experience. When I suggested this before, I
received from two people almost-angry replies that
such a thing was too daunting to even suggest, yet
one other person had already been quietly sending 
me sound files via private email. One idea is to
find internet-accessible memory space which we can 
temporarily upload stuff to, and then reference via 
URL links in our messages so as not to clog the list 
stream itself. Maybe if we compare notes we can
find a file format which most of us can listen to.
