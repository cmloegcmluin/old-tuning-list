Hm; spoken as a non-improviser I suspect?

When I was a kid and went to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico USA, the tour
guide at one point stopped the group and turned off the lights and had 
anyone with glow-in-the-dark watches cover their wrists, and asked everyone
to stand perfectly still and make no sound, and just look and listen. It
was absolutely black and silent. I think I might have heard a drop of 
water echo as it hit some distant stalagmite. It was great. When I went
back recently, like 30 years later, they were no longer doing tours.
Everyone was tramping in and out on their own like ants.

How about the ever-present hard-drive spin noise? I hate that! I hate the
fridge noise. It always sneaks into even headphones and interferes
with the pitches I'm trying to tune. During a sever wind storm here in
Los Angeles last week, our electricity went out for a full day and night.
The lessening of the noise level was pleasurable. 

Floatation-tank places make money from people's need for sensory silence.

Hey, just wrap some metal foil around your head like Timothy Leary and you'll
be fine! ;)

Move to the countryside. Hold all calls. Toss the radio. Keep the fridge
in the barn. Meditate. Wait.

Which is your name; Bruce or Jo?
