Hello Tuning buddies,

Another quick question:

There is a hypercard tuning program available at the mills ftp site.
I can't seem to remember its name or find the appropriate ftp address.

Can anyone help me?

A more hypothetical question. I've gotten interested in tunings that
are more dissonant. This is because I've heard a kind of a tone cloud
during rock shows. This cloud is recognized by many people in the
audience and the musicians. However I doubt anyone knows exactly
what it is. I have guessed that it is the result of sloppy tuning and
loud thick harmonics. Its really a cool sound.

I am going to attempt to synthesise it using a retuned Kurtzweill.
My first attempts will use 11 tet and 13 tet, in combination with 12 tet.
Any thoughts.

I know it sounds amatuerish and insane...

but that is me...
