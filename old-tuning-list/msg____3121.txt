Subject: Huh?

From: hyperpoodle@mail.sisna.com (Doren Garcia)

Hello Waveophiles & Professor Ludwig Plutonium,

I am unfamiliar with the aesthetic of the school of 'New Complexity'. Can
someone offer a synopsis of their ideas?

I have a basic understanding of waveform relationships, JI, and tempered
tunings. Or at least I thought I did. I must admit that many of the
concepts discussed in this forum are unfamiliar to me. Can anyone recommend
a book that will explain concepts such as, Wilson CPS scales, subharmonics
and the associated mathematical principles involved?

Can I make a request? I would like to see a short explanation of one
concept a day at the end of each of these digests.

Would anyone else benefit from a small tutorial each day?

Who is Cosmic Ray? And who are the shoes in the back seat of Calvin's Car?
(hint: a quote from ???)
