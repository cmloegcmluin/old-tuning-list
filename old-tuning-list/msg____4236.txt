I am a woman! I'm mostly concerned with  working  with  children as a
Kodaly  trained music educator, and having  written a thesis on the
pedagogy of just intonation in choral music, work a lot in very subtle ways
with intonation exercises with children from 3 years old, with singing
games based on pure intonation of falling minor thirds (easiest to sing
purely at that age) and with my older children in a special music program
at a primary school where the children have daily music classes, building
triads in ways that allow them to hear the overtones and tune to each
other. All very practical, although I have interest in the philosophical
domain as well (part of my thesis was a history of ideas about tuning) I
don't contribute a lot these days, as I am also training as a
psychotherapist and researching new psychologicala domains and very
busy!!!!
One thing I am not, is a composer, and also not so interested in the
instrumental as the vocal domain of music making.
