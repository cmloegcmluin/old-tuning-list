Subject: Microtuning environment for Logic EMagic (tuning.lso)

From: harmonic@globalnet.co.uk (Harmonics Inc.)

For any microtonalists using EMagic Logic, as we are here in London,

Brian Pugsley as posted a new environment to play many microtunings to the
nearest 64th of a semitone.

The Logic patch is now publically and freely available from

http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/tuning.zip for PC version
and http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy/lsd/tuning.sit for Mac


There are also links to it from the LucyTuning site at
http://lehua.ilhawaii.net/~lucy,
or the European mirror at http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~harmonic.

Happy tuning- feedback appreciated.
