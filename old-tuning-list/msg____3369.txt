"Best" has a strict mathematical, as opposed to musical definition. 
Consequently, the most desirable musical result may conflict. Of course 
you may rework the notation to reflect that. I chose not to, simply 
because I was aiming at a general method. The method accounts for all the 
usual notations of many ETs, such as 19, 22, 31, 43, 53, 72, and others, 
including many not usually used. It also allows for an improvement in 
Blackwood's notations in a few cases.

I disagree with Paul E. that there is an implication that the best minor
third is what he says. Obviously it will frequently emerge from the
complement of the M3 in the P5, but certainly in 20 it doesn't.

However, it does seem possible to build a notation out of various
intervals; using 1:3 and 1:5 is quite sensible, traditional, and powerful
(in terms of theory and explanatory adequacy). I look forward to an
article using, say, 1:3 and 3:5, but I think 1:5 is a better choice. 

Let's look at 17. Assuming a starting point of D, the 5-unit m3 is F/.
What's wrong with that? Of course this is also F#\, reflecting the
important fact that this tuning contains a neutral third. In other words,
the M3 and m3 meet at 5 units. If you want a 282-cent m3, because it is a
few cents closer to the just 5:6, that's fine; it may be called F.

There is no more inherent reason to expect the m3 and M3 to "behave
properly" than there is for cycles of P5 or for the M3 and P5 together.
Some tunings, like 25 and marginally like 17, may have two minor thirds.
Tunings with large numbers of units in the octave may have several of
everything. I don't find this a fault of notation in general or of my 
proposal.

In 20 there is the curious result that all the extant commas are an even 
number of units, but it doesn't matter.

Tunings have many properties, all of which cannot be most clearly shown 
at once. The discussion does not imply that the "best" size always works. 
Quite the contrary. That is one point of the article. In some cases I 
am unsure what to do about it. I intend a follow-up article at some time.

In one sense this is true, viz. that the Pythagorean komma is 12v-7a, 
where v is a P5 and a is an octave. That governs a lot, as that komma 
figures in the others. But in another sense it's irrelevant, because I 
have attempted to maintain some conventions, including heptatonic naming, 
which are based on pre-12 considerations, as Paul E. shows, all in a 5-limit.
But I don't "measure" all tunings "in reference to 12-tET."

I don't think so. It implies setting up the 3-limit to take care of itself
(sharps/flats) and then seeing what happens with the 5-limit intervals in
terms of the octave, as Paul E. states. There's no 12 in there. By the 
way, I am quite interested in nonstandard naming too, as a previous XH 
article on 13-tET shows. Would Paul E. elaborate on notating something with 
different notes? It's hard to see how he gets from commas to notes in the 
quotation above.

What is "consistent within the 5-limit"? He may have something because, 
on occasion, use of kommas others than syntonic seems a bit arbitrary. In 
some cases it's fine, as in 31.

In a sense this is true, with reference to the 12v-7a I mentioned 
earlier. But that is possibly a simpler comma than 19v-11a, 31v-18a, 
22v-13a, etc. Maybe we should go for 7v-4a?

The interesting question then becomes how do you build a general system, 
let us say still on a 5 limit, without this one bit of 12 in it--a system 
which is no more tied to anything than this one is?

This isn't a quibble, it's an outright error. It has been pointed out
before, and quite honestly I don't know how I let it get in there. Paul E.
is correct.

This bears consideration, I believe.

I am grateful to Paul Erlich for his thorough consideration of my 
article. Put in his terms, I can see the bit of 12 behind some of my 
proposals. They come from other considerations, mostly, which are not 
12-related. In any case, the challenge is always there for someone to do 
something better, or at least as thorough.
