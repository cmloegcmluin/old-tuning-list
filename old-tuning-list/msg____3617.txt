Subject: RE: Consistency generalized

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Paul Hahn,

Your generalization is quite correct and produces the desired result of a 
more stringent criterion. The musical meaning of integer levels of 
consistency higher than 1, namely, the importance of matching just 
intonation in combinations of n-limit intervals, I find dubious. So level 2 
consistency seems like an arbitrary requirement, as level 2.1 consistency 
and level 1.9 consistency would lead to results which are slightly different 
but just as meaningful musically.

One thing I looked at long ago was what we would now call level 3 
consistency, since 12-tET is just barely level 3 consistent at the 5-limit. 
It seemed reasonable that an equal temperament could be "fuzzified" so that 
it covered one-third of frequency space, while two-thirds remained 
out-of-tune with respect to the equal temperament. The simplest qualifiers 
are:


3-limit:	 5-tET
5-limit:	 12-tET
7-limit:	 31-tET
9-limit:	 171-tET
11-limit:	342-tET (=2*171)

My Commodore 64 couldn't do the higher-limit calculations within a 
reasonable period of time, but these days it's just a few seconds:

13-limit:	5585-tET (=5*1117)
15-limit:	5585-tET
17-limit:	16808-tET (=22*764)
19-limit:	20203-tET (=89*227)
