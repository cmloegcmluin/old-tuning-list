Ah, but they do this to bring the tunes to within the critical tempo bands
that the dancers in their clubs prefer! :) Do a test yourself, like I did,
and listen to the local rap/urban/house/dance music station with a metronome 
and write down the tempo of each tune that comes along. You'll see that they 
fall into about 3 separate narrow bands, separated by wide bands in which
no tunes are played, something like the emission bands given off by elements 
in a flame, if I might be so analogistic.

You might as well use real triplets or n-plets for each base tempo, and temper
only the relationships between base tempos when modulating. 

On a related anecdote, I often hear drummers on recordings and those who 
I play with live speed up when they play fills involving faster notes.
It's only the really good drummers who keep comfortably consistent
time no matter what rhythmic octave they are playing in. 

Another anecdote, someone once wrote to me about the possibility of a software 
module to process a quantized midi file to slow down the tempo at 
parts where a real pianist would have to move one or both hands far across
the keyboard, the amount of slowing depending on the distance traversed,
to make the track more human-sounding.

There's also that process where you delay each note by a small amount relative
to the volume of the note, since some musicians who use their hands like percussion
players will bring their hands farther away from the instrument in preparation
for a harder striking, and take a little longer time to reach the instrument.
Good players will of course compensate for or avoid this unconcious habit
