I have seen several references on this list to pseudocommas, usually with
reference to 22TET, and also recall seeing a reference by Brian McLaren to
the 11-limit comma (or perhaps an undecimal comma, I forget which). While I
understand what a conventional comma is, I am unfamiliar with either this
22-TET pseudocomma or any undecimal/11-limit comma, and wonder if anyone
couls enlighten me.

Many thanks,
