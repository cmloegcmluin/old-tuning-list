No, they weren't, were they?  So what were you referring to when you
said this a few articles back?

"As pointed out by Prof. Rasch, Kirnberger admitted several times to
Marpurg that Bach tuned each one of  his fifths a bit flat."

But this is _still_ incorrect.  For example, consider a temperament in
which five succesive fifths are tempered by 1/5 Pythagorean comma each,
and the other seven just.  In this tuning, all major thirds are wider
than just, but it has no fewer than _four_ Pythagorean major thirds
(wide by a syntonic comma).

(It is curious to me that, while you insist the evidence is unambiguous,
you resort to interpretations and speculations like this one and the one
below.)

So you'd rather trust Marpurg's slanted interpretation of Kirnberger's
statements, even though he makes a whopping big theoretical error in it?
Hmmph.

The following two quotes are from _A History of Key Characteristics in
the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries_, by Rita Steblin (UMI
Research Press, 1983), already cited once in this thread.

p.91:
: It is known that Marpurg's attack caused Kirnberger much bitter
: anguish: he poured out his vexation in a series of letters to Forkel
: from 1779-80.  . . . although Kirnberger did not publish a
: counterattack himself, he did include a defense written by the
: important mathematician and military officer at the Berlin court,
: Georg Friedrich Tempelhof (1737-1807).

p.92:
: Marpurg, the avowed disciple of Rameau, had drawn clear battle lines
: between his theories in support of equal temperament and those of
: Kirnberger.  Since the latter had declared that his primary intention in
: _Die Kunst_ was to transmit the theoretical principles of J.S. Bach,
: Marpurg's cruelest blow was the accusation that Kirnberger was not
: faithful to Bach--not faithful because, as Marpurg contended, Bach had
: actually taught Kirnberger to tune in equal temperament.  Marpurg then
: appealed to Bach's sons to substantiate him in his claim, but this ruse
: backfired, and Kirnberger was able to end _Die Kunst_ with the following
: passage taken from a letter that C.P.E. Bach had sent him:
: 
:      The conduct of Herr Marpurg against you is abominable. . . . You
:      may proclaim that my fundamental principles and those of my late
:      father are anti-Rameau.
: 
: In this manner Kirnberger managed to get in a final blow.  Although it
: is not clear whether this quotation applies specifically to unequal
: temperament and key characteristics, there is no reason to believe that
: this topic--so important in Kirnberger's writing--should be excluded
: from the anti-Rameauist principles espoused by the Bachs.
