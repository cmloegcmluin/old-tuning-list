Sounded to me like we were reaching something resembling a
consensus on San Diego.  (Of course, my opinion is biased)

Sonic Arts would be ideal for "a short, informal get-together".
If anyone in San Diego or coming to town is interested, all it
takes is a call or email to us.

Patrick Ozzard-Low (see Ehrlich's posting in TD 1567 re: the
Boston meeting) is now in California, and will be presenting
a seminar on new microtonal instruments here at UCSD on Monday
(November 2nd at 11:15 am in Erickson Hall -- John Fonville
has welcomed the local microtonal community to attend).

Needless to say, Patrick will be visiting us to examine our
unique collection of instruments.  Our mission is to glue
together the disparate elements of microtonalia in SoCal,
so all are welcome.

I envisioned the international conference to be something on a
MUCH grander scale, the likes of which have never before been
seen in microtonalitydom.

Bill's suggestions re: facilities are right-on -- it's important
to be properly prepared for something of this magnitude.  The more
time spent in preparation and the more ergonomic the facilities,
the more valuable the whole experience will be for all of us.

There are a few of us in San Diego looking into possiblities of
university sponsorship (or at least hosting).  No serious decisions
should be made until a school or other facility has made an
agreement for this purpose.  Then we can proceed with calls for
papers, event planning, etc.

I have already given my support for Bill's procuring Harvey Mudd
college as a hosting-site, should nothing materialize in San Diego.
