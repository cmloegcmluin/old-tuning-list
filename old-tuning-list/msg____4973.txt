Subject: In search of tuning paper

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

While doing some research on the Bohlen-Pierce scale recently, I came
across the following reference:

M. V. Mathews, L. A. Roberts, and J. R. Pierce, "Four new scales based
on nonsuccessive-integer-ratio chords," Journal of the Acoustical
Society of America 75, S10(A) (1984).

Upon tracking down this reference at the library, I was dismayed to find
that it only refers to an abstract of a paper presented at the 107th
Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.  I have been unsuccessful
so far in locating the complete paper.  Can someone on the list point me
to where I might find the full paper?  If anyone actually possesses this
paper, can you contact me directly about obtaining a photocopy of it?

Many thanks,
John
