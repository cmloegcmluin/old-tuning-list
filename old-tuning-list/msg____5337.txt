Subject: MELISMA ,Bottrigari,  Any other  publications???

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Whether or not _Portamenti_ were used in early western music in a
systematic way as ornaments - akin to _gamakas_ - is unclear and
controversial. Indeed, in Karnatic music _theory_, it is unclear whether
the gamakas should include slides (as is the practice) or should be made of
discrete pitches. 

To the best of my knowledge, only Prof. Jon Barlow (Wesleyan) has worked
with both South Indian Music and medieval music (especially neumes) in
terms of this dimension of performance practice. Unfortunately, he
publishes very little.

The analogy between _gamakas_ and western figures and ornaments is made
difficult by the harmonic context in which those figures and ornaments are
placed. A good start for reading about the later topic is:

Dietrich Bartel _Handbuch der musikalischen Figurenlehre_ (Laaber Verlag,
2nd ed. 1992).
