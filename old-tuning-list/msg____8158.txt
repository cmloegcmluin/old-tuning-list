Zilch, unless you count the prototypes Creamware has.

Somewhere in Germany.

Maaaaaybe.....

The system was first seen at the Frankfurt MusikMesse in February, as a 
board with
6 chips on it. They've  just revised the spec (at the same price point) 
to include 15 chips, ea 50% faster than the old ones. Projected to ship 
in October, 1998

Of course the way things go, it may never see the retail light of day.
