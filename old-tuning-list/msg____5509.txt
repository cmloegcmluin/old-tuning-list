Subject: new instrument

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Hooray...at last, my 34 tone acoustic bass is finished. I must thank 
the late Larry Hanson for the financial support which made this possible, 
and John Starrett for a great job on the instrument itself. Between 
Starrett and myself we now have: 34 tone electric guitar/bass, 34 
acoustic guitar/bass, 19 tone electric and acoustic guitar/bass, 31 tone 
electric, and a fretless guitar as well. Upcoming projects are a 31 
acoustic guitar/bass, and a fretless acoustic. I believe Paul Erlich now 
has his 22 tone guitar, so I would be interested to see what he comes up 
with...again, Hanson needs much thanks, because he believed enough in his 
dreams to make them a reality...Hstick
