In addition, it has been my experience that when creating JI related sample
loops, that it is not enough that the frequency relationships be exact - the
period of the wave cycles involved all must have a simple divisible integer
relation with one common compound period/sample length. Further, I believe
that it is best to have a simple divisible relationship with the sampling rate
one is employing. As an example, for a recent set of 21 JI pitch relationships
I developed, I used a common 1/1 period number/sample base length of 21870. I
then doubled this number to achieve the sampling rate of 43740.

21870 divided by 1/1 = 21870
21870 "   "    " 9/8 = 19440
21870 "   "    " 6/5 = 18225
21870 "   "    " 5/4 = 17496
21870 "   "    " 27/20 = 16200
21870 "   "    " 45/32 = 15552
21870 "   "    " 3/2 = 14580
21870 "   "    " 27/16 = 12960
21870 "   "    " 9/5 = 12150
21870 "   "    " 15/8 = 11664
21870 "   "    " 81/40 = 10800  
21870 "   "    " 135/64 = 10368
21870 "   "    " 729/320 = 9600
21870 "   "    " 1215/512 = 9216
21870 "   "    " 81/32 = 8640
21870 "   "    " 729/256 = 7680
21870 "   "    " 243/80 = 7200
21870 "   "    " 405/128 = 6912
21870 "   "    " 2187/640 = 6400
21870 "   "    " 3645/1024 = 6144
21870 "   "    " 243/64 = 5760

Obviously, this base number gets larger with each added interval and can very
quickly go out of bounds even when one is using the simplest of source
materials. I, myself, have found it most unwieldy, if not impossible, to
create viable samples using anything besides sawtooth, square, etc. More
complex waveforms, or anything remotely resembling the physical model of an
acoustic instrument would take more sample RAM than I,for one, currently have!

At any rate, if I read (the slightly truncated) explanation above correctly,
JI is an impossible goal in the real, 3D/air based world we reside in. That
makes perfect sense to me, but one can only try...
