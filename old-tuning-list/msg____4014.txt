Subject: Brian's boo-boo boo-hoo

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	My mother (a fairly reliable source) informs me that I used to 
throw a ball into the air and cry when it would fall back down. That's 
what you get when you have unrealistic expectations. 
	Try this little experiment. Using Excite, for instance, do a search on 
microtonaliy (122 hits) then search on microtonal (528 hits). Microtone 
gets you even less (36 hits). Try a wildcard search microton* and you will
get 30 (more or less) French microton references.
	The lesson is this--do not assume that a search engine is going 
to do what you assume it will. If you know what you are doing, you 
get results. If not, not. And if you fancy yourself a microdeity, you may 
make a fool of yourself in print.
