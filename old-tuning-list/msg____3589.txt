   I'd say that it's not so much a matter of telling when a note is out of tune
as devising a strict mathematically rigorous definition - or even a general
qualitative definition - of what constitutes being in-tune.  Every careful
studies I'm aware of suggests that singers players of indefinite-pitch
instruments don't consistently follow any one particular standard.  

   And then you have to answer the question of whether an exactly perfect 9:7
third (for example) should be considered in-tune or out-of-tune.  It's out of
tune if 2^4/12 or 5:4 is your basis for deciding, but, by definition, it's
exactly in-tune if 9:7 is your goal.  

   We probably need a few more words or phrases to describe these new concepts.
