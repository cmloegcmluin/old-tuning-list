Re: Microtonal Jazz. I have seen - but not heard - an LP by Emil Richards
with a title akin to _Emil Richards and his Microtonal Blues Band_. It was
in Erv Wilson*s record collection and he pointedly stopped me from further
inquiry.

Re: Woodwinds and microtonality. I have had some interesting experiences
with _historical_ woodwind instruments (especially one-keyed flutes,
baroque oboes, and classical clarinets - sorry, no bassoon experiences,
Johnny) which are quite flexible pitch-wise, if one is willing to accept a
great deal of timbral variety. Personally, I find the homogenous sound of
Boehm and Conservertoire instruments to be tiresome, and the larger number
of open holes on early instruments allows for more finger nuance. Players
of modern instruments frequently complain that _intonation_ is difficult on
historical instruments, but I think that this has to be qualified as _equal
tempered intonation with uniform timbres_ are difficult... Clearly, for
composers with intonational interests, these may be virtuous qualities.
