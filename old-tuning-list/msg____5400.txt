Doty, David. The Just Intonation Primer. San Francisco: The Just Intonation
Network, 1993.

http://www.dnai.com:80/~jinetwk/

Here's what the web site says about it:

Do you want to start making music in Just Intonation, but don't know where
to begin? Or do you just want to find out what all the talk is about? The
Just Intonation Primer will give you the information you need, in a
succinct and readable form. With 78 pages of text and over 50 charts and
diagrams, The Just Intonation Primer explains the essential concepts of
Just Intonation in terms that practicing composers and musicians will
understand.



Praise for The Just Intonation Primer:

       I highly recommend this book as a textbook for theory classes and as
an introduction to more detailed and idiosyncratic works on JI...
Independent composers frustrated by the limits of 12 [tone equal
temperament] should read this book...

John H. Chalmers, Jr. -- Xenharmonikôn

       David Doty is the appropriate person to create such a work... he has
the requisite subject matter expertise in generous measure, and he has been
in a position to know what students of the subject want and need. The book
that results is a concise, practical, informative, and very affordable
text.

Bart Hopkin -- Experimental Musical Instruments

       ...Doty has emerged as one of the preeminent contemporary theorists
of JI, showing himself to be a gifted expositor as well as a careful and
imaginative thinker. Hence the Primer is likely to become the main text and
reference for American composers interested in the resources of JI.

Dudley Duncan -- Ars Musica Denver


Unlike many previous texts dealing with tuning theory and its applications,
The Just Intonation Primer is intended for readers with an elementary
knowledge of common-practice music theory and no training in higher
mathematics. Its object is to prepare the reader to begin practical work in
Just Intonation and to understand more advanced texts and articles.
Previously, the few books available on Just Intonation have been difficult
to obtain and more difficult to understand. The primer will make it easy
for any interested musician to understand the fundamentals of Just
Intonation and begin making real music.

Among the principal topics addressed in the primer are:

       What is Just Intonation?
       A brief history of tuning in Western music
       Acoustic and psychoacoustic background
       Basic definitions, conventions, and procedures
       Intervals, chords, fixed scales, and extended tonal space
       Practical Just Intonation with real instruments
