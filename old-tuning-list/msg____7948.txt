From: "Loffink, John" <John.Loffink@COMPAQ.com>

I just got off the phone with Yamaha technical support.  The EX5/EX5R/EX7
support 32 preset scales selectable per layer.  However, no user
programmable scales are available, and the operating system does not run off
of Flash ROM so there is no easy means to upgrade it.  This crosses the
EX5/EX5R/EX7 off the list of most microtonal explorers.
