Subject: Partch압 Antecedents

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

I don앖 want to downplay in any way Partch압 orginality. I would only like
to put some aspects of his harmonic language in a broader perspective, and
in a perspective that places his practice into the mainstream of western
harmonic practice, rather than an eccentric footnote.

Since I come from a generation of musicians whose training includes a
larger share of contrapuntal thinking - and consequently a less dense
harmonic texture - the density of Partch압 music is distinctive and demands
some more thought - and deeper listening. For example: beyond practical
considerations of instrumentation, what concerns govern Partch압 voice
leading?
