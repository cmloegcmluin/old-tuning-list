Thanks John,I downloaded them. I wonder if I'm the only bbshopper who
subscribes to this list?

John, there are some VERY creative writers and arrangers in the bbshop
community. And there is an ongoing war about how big the bbshop UMBRELLA
should be. The "out there" qtets do a lot of stuff that reminds one of
the HiLos or ManhattanTransfer but they always return(eventually) to the
orgasmic 7th for max RING.
I would like to see some of the top acapella groups compete in a bbshop
contest....I think they would have trouble  qualifying for the top ten.
