Subject: more Partch comments

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick again...once again, pardon me if I'm wrong, but did not 
Partch himself, in several places in his book, get rather indignant
at those folks who had possession of microtonal keyboards (such as
Universities), but kept them under glass, so to speak, and would not
allow access to them by interested parties? And rightfully so...
Jon Szanto's comment to me in the last digest about respecting a
person's wishes as to how they want their music performed, referring
to Partch, was OK by me...but, again, I must state that music, once 
brought into the physical world, belongs to no one (except in a legal
sense, to prevent them from getting ripped off)...since I did not know
Partch, I am at somewhat of a disadvantage here...but, I see no sensible
reason why his music should not be performed by whoever wants to, on
whatever instruments they want to use. Of course, one should respect
another's wishes...however, I think being selfish with one's art is
unacceptable on a deep level...sorry...Hstick
