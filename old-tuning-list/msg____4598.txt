I've played around with exactly this idea in JI intervals before.
I haven't tried it in the various meantones. 

Outside of musical context, just comparing these various pitch sets and say
randomly arpeggiating them or something, I find the sound of the pythagorean 
the most entertaining. It's nice and stretched out sounding (adding one more 
fifth at B 243/128 starts to "stretch" my tolerence though).  

To me, this is still not a "problem". Each of these pitch sets is a separate 
sound with its own identity and possible musical uses, in other words, no 
punning. To me, it would only be punning if you really wanted one voicing, but 
your instrument only had another, so you substituted. That would be at least 
conceptually ugly. Maybe I'm using pun differently than Daniel Wolf or others?

The "problem" here may be in trying to transfer what in 12tet is considered a
consonant chord--a Major 6 9 chord--into JI and trying to make it serve the
same purpose. I don't really consider any of the JI approximations of this as 
consonant. All of them contain relationships which tug at the ear. If I had
a nice 8:10:12, or even 8:9:10:12 going on, I probably wouldn't want to add 
some version of a dissonant 6th, or if I did, it would be for a musical reason 
which would automatically suggest which pitch would be correct, for instance,
if the A were left sustaining from a previous F chord as we moved to a C
"add 9" chord then it would make sense as 5/3 and the dissonance against the 
9/8 D would highlight its function and meaning.

My question would be, "why try to use a structure which doesn't suggest itself
musically?". If it occurs because of the juxtaposition of melodic fragments,
then it would both be justified by and serve to highlight those melodies. If 
we were trying to make the most of the possible combinations of a predetermined 
pitch set as some sort of "challenge", then I think we would be making the wrong 
approach. (Sorry; I know you didn't want to get into the subject of whether
melody and harmony should determine pitch set or the reverse, but that's what 
I'm thinking about these days. I reserve the right to change my position at a 
later date. <heh>)

Incidentally, if you use the 9/8 and the 5/3, but add a 4/3 to the chord, like 

1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3

the thing starts to support its own dissonance in a really nice way since
each little otonal 8:9:10 subset resonates on its own even with the 40/27's
and stuff going on between them, at least to my ear.
