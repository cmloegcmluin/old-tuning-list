Subject: Re: 12-tet in China

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

The large cache of 12-bell/chimes per octave running several octaves and 
found laying on the ground out of order are an interesting historical 
find.  A Chinese friend translated a Chinese article about them and Fritz 
Kuttner played me a tape of these rare percussion.

It seems that the majority of them have 3 koo...different points with 
which one can strike, giveing off different pitch.  Non-Chinese have been 
forbidden to directly play these percussion and I don't know if that has 
ever changed.  Surely, they have been hung in size order, but it is wrong 
to deduce the tuning implications by the mere 12 bell/chimes per octave.
Even solid metal loses it exact tuning after 2 thousand years.


Chin music made use of tuning modulations from Just 
(harmonic-representing heaven), Pythagorean (open strings-representing 
earth), and Stopped (fingers on the strings now heard in equal 
temperament-representing people).

My surmise is that before the Mongol invasions outlawed Han Chinese 
social theater and music, in effect raping it over hundreds of years, 
there may have been microtonal activity in the form of multiple notes per 
octave - past 12.  As a result of the Mongol invasions, pentatonicism as 
the simplest means would dominate.  There is a Chinese word for a foreign 
note outside the system.  (Pinyon? sp.)  

Yin Fah Loo, guest musicologist from Shanghai, spent a year as guest 
lecturer in Chou Wen Chung's graduate Chinese music classes at Columbia 
University shared this material with us when I was a grad student in 
ethnomusicology in 1982.
