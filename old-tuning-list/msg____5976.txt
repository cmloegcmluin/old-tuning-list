This is not what Paul seemed to be saying: he left the size of the tone
open, but required that the quarter tones be genuine fourth roots. As
I've said before, I can't agree with either: the interval of a
"quartertone" is sometimes correlated with a frequency ratio of
2^(1/24)/1, as in Vischnegradskij, but is more often left unspecified,
as with "semitone" and "tone". Like the latter it is a term belonging to
the phenomenal domain of pitch relations, rather than the acoustic
domain of frequency ratios (which is where the syntonic comma belongs,
as you appear to agree). There is no universal one-to-one mapping from
the domain of pitch relations to the range of frequency ratios;
sometimes such a mapping is specified (e.g. Ben Johnston) or implicit
(Vishnegradskij), sometimes the mapping is one-to-two (as in the tunings
c.1400 which incorporate both Pythagorean and quasi-just imperfect
consonances), but by far most often, the mapping from pitch relations to
frequency ratios is simply left open -- no single tuning system is
required for the realisation of a given score. Quarter-tone notation is
used freely and flexibly by many composers of non-keyboard based
instrumental music today, and their notation shares the functional
distinctions of semitone notation (i.e. signs for both 1/4-tone sharp
and 3/4-tone flat are employed, and likewise 1/4-tone flat and 3/4-tone
sharp). Are we to say that all string-quartet composers, from Barto'k to
Ferneyhough, who have used quartertone notation were demanding a strict
12TET environment for their quartertones? Any case you construct for
mapping quartertones to 50 cents will also map semitones to 100 cents
and so on, but the term "semitone" has generally been used without any
such specification in mind -- indeed it was used freely by many
mediaeval theorists who explicitly discounted the bisection of the tone;
for them, semitone, was an umbrella term for limmas and apotomes.
