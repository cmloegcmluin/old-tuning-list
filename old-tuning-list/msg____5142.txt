Subject: science and such

From: Gary Morrison <MorriSonics@compuserve.com>

> Math and science, religion and mysticism...what's the difference?

   Music could well be the one topic that all four address most nearly
equally.  So to understand music, you'd have to see it from all of those
disciplines' viewpoints.  But the MUST remain separate viewpoints, and can
never be merged.  

   Here's the key point:
      Science raises PLENTY of questions we DO NOT know the answer to,
      but it NEVER raises questions that we CANNOT know the answer to.  

   The goal of science is to make what was once unknown, become absolutely
obvious, unambiguous, and just plain as day.  

   But the situation is the opposite for mysticism and religion.  The
obvious and unambiguous are what are of marginal interest at best to
mysticism.  What's interesting are the haunting little questions like, "why
when I hear Brahms' Requiem late at night in a dark room does it sometimes
make me smile like a baby and sometimes make me cry like a baby?"

   You know as well as I do that a neurophysiologist could prattle off an
answer, probably involving neurotransmission enzyme action across synaptic
.. trimethyl-dibenzyl ... neuron firing rates ... ... autonomic hormonal
.. ... capillarian blood flow to the hippcampal ...  

   And you also know as well as I do that that wouldn't answer the question
at all!  

   So you'd certainly be absolutely correct to recognize that music
manifests itself both as the purely objective physical reality of sound
waves, and in the joyous, curious, haunting, devastating, or inspiring
waves of emotion it splashes through our minds.  

   But you'd equally certainly be sadly mistaken if you think that you can
apply scientific law to mystic sensation, or apply mystical inspiration to
solving differential equations!
