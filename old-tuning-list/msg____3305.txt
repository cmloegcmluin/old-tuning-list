Subject: bibliographies, etc. according to B. McLaren

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Brian McLaren may not have understood the purpose of the *references* in
my JMT paper, as John Chalmers points out and as JMT would point out also.
If Brian had merely said "Well, I have a few additional resources, and they
are the following," there would be no problem. In fact, I found his list
and descriptions interesting.

But Brian's writing, like all in this list, is indexed and searchable by
means of various services and engines--and therefore is not acceptable to
me. Others of you have said the same thing. 

I won't dignify his accusations with a detailed response, because they are
really about him, not me at all. But I was interested to learn from Brian
that I had studied with Easley Blackwood. Hmm...I wonder when that was!? 
Maybe Brian can tell us that too.

In the past Brian has helped me a lot, as he has others. I remain
grateful. I am not grateful for his inconsiderate and false remarks. Since
Brian accuses everyone on the list of being incompetent and criminal, he
owes all of us an apology. People who have written far less nastily than
he has have been removed from other non-moderated lists. I don't wish that
here, however. I merely ask him to write his messages for public
consumption in an acceptable mode of discourse. Everyone else does, as far
as I can tell, and I have been here since Day 1, or perhaps Day 2.
