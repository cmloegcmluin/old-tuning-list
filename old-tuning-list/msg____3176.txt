Yes there was a ban on his works being performed. Perhaps him being
"fout" during the war in taking the position of director does indeed
still account for a large part for the small spreading of his music. 
I don't know how the opinions vary about the affair nowadays. Perhaps
there are indeed still people who hold it against him even now after 
his death. Though many feel that the matter should be put behind a long 
time ago. Or it's just that he has been a bit forgotten because of this.

Groetjes,
