I disagree, the word is also being used for the opposite of tempered.
"Pure" is an accurate translation of the words for JI in Dutch and German:
"rein" (reine stemming/Stimmung) and "zuiver" (zuivere stemming, intonatie).
On the other hand, the cognate "puur/pur" is seldomly used.
On the other other hand, neither is the cognate "juist/just".
One could even argue that "just" in its meaning of right and precise might
be applied to tempered intervals if they are accurately tuned, but that's
admittedly not what's usually meant.
So I see no problem in using pure for just.
