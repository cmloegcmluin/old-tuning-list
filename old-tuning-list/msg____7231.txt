Subject: Greek scales and names confusion????

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

One of the visitors at my http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy site sent me the 
following comments.

>According to an article on Greece in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and
>Musicians, ancient Greek names for species of the octave included the 
following (on white keys):
>B-B: Mixolydian
>E-E: Dorian
>A-A: Hypodorian
>D-D: Phrygian
>G-G: Hypophrygian
>C-C: Lydian
>F-F: Hypolydian
>Apparently, the Greeks counted intervals from top to bottom. When medieval
>ecclesiastical scholars tried to interpret the ancient texts, they counted
>from bottom to top, jumbling the information. The names on the table are the
>ecclesiastical names.

I checked back in Groves on scales,at the Westminster Music Library near 
Victoria Station yesterday, yet am
still confused.
Can any of the tuning "experts" throw any light on this conundrum please?
