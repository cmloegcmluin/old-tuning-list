Subject: Re: updates to my website

From: monz@juno.com

Just wanted to let y'all know that I've been
slaving away at my website.  There's lots
of new stuff, new links to stuff that was
already there, and many corrections.

(The size of non-microtonality material is
also growing -- can't help it, I'm deeply
interested in lots of other things.)

Of particular interest to you folks would be
the Robert Johnson and Jimi Hendrix pages --
any guitarists willing to tackle "Hendrix Chord"?
