From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I thought I would throw my 7 cap (preferred term to limit) tuning to the
wolves (no pun intended Dan)  because I thought It might be useful to
David Finnamore! This is my centaur tuning found in xh16.

1/1  21/20  9/8  7/6  5/4  4/3  7/5  3/2  14/9  5/3  7/4  15/8  2/1

There are some features I find interesting as well as musically
resourceful
1. 2 Harmonic series up to the 10th a fifth a part (1/1 and  4/3)
2. I subharmonic series down to the 10th (on 7/4)
3. repeated tetrachords  (starting 7/6 and 7/4) that contain many Greek
tetrachords or  Persian permutations.
4. at least one version of all of the Ptolemy superparticular trichords.
( these are 16/15-5/4,8/7-7/6, 10/9-6/5
5. two hexanies 1-3-5-9 and 1-3-7-9
6. Just major scale on "C"

When I came up with this tuning I had just acquired my first pump organ
and wanted a tuning where i could sustain the most intervals and
structures as possible
