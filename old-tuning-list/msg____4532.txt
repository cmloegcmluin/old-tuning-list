Subject: Sruti (shruti)

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

I have a few short communications from a person living about 50 miles 
from me on the subject of Indian sruti and scale tuning. He has looked at 
early Sanskrit texts and also tried to deal with the sruti concept 
from various points of view within Just Intonation. He examines various 
issues in content and structure, representing his results in diagrams and 
lattices.

The problem is that I am no expert on Indian classical theory, nor do I 
have the time to respond to his request for comments on what he's 
written. I am therefore looking for anyone qualified on this list who might 
have an hour to look at the material and send comments to its author.

To such a person I will send the papers. Please respond to me rather than 
to the list. The author is not on the list, by the way.

Thanks in advance for any interest. I think reading the material will be 
worthwhile.
