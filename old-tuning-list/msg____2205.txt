I dug out my old Finale 2.0 documentation last night and found (as I suspected)
that it too supports the nonstandard key signature dialogs that Brian discovered
in version 3.5. So it would seem that Finale has had this feature for many
years now. Now I suppose I ought to my money where my mouth is and take a
serious stab at actually trying to use this stuff.
