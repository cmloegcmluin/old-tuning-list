Not certain what a "Lydian melody" is.  Are you saying that the Lydian
mode has characterstics melodic motions, as would say, an Indian raga?

It not clear to me how the imperfect 5th (40/27) can be avoided.
Even if the tonic is 'd', the 5th above must be 'a' at an interval
of 40/27ths, yes?  We cannot transpose the Dorian mode to begin
with the interval 9/8 instead of 10/9.

Again, in monophonic music, which the ancient Greek mode was, 
would the 'f' need to lowered to avoid the tritone, or would the
729/512ths jump be made?

Thanks.
