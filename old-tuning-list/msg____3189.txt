Not only does that minor third sound wide from just, but it also beats just 
under 3 times per second. Gary, maybe you should listen to it on a different 
stereo system, this beating is not hard to hear. The lower note of the minor 
third is about a middle d#, and a little calculation shows that the beat 
frequency for a 22-tet minor third in this register is 2.5 Hz. Considering 
that this was a Korg, the disrepancy is forgivable -- when the minor third 
moves down a semitone, the beat frequency falls to just over 2 Hz. Another 
clue that the piece is in 22 is the melodic division of the major third into 
two almost-but-not-quite-equal parts, which is impossible in 19.
