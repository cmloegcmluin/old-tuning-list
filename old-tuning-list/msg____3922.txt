That is not true, on many computer-based soundcard systems at 
least. On my PC(386)+SoundBlaster system, a pitch-bend must be 
timed about 10 ms in advance of the start of the note, or a 
slide can be heard in the note attack. A soon as I started to 
post recordings on the net, I found that a lot of other 
computer systems and cards show effects similar to mine. I 
also note that real instruments have decays after the end of 
notes, and a pitch-bend command will slide them too.

That's why I ended up restricting my pitch-bends to the 
beginning of a piece then waiting 1/4 s before the start of 
note on's. Otherwise, you would have to determine the decay 
time of the worst- case note-off plus the pitch-bend actuation 
time, assign notes only to channels that had been quiet at 
least that long, and insert the pitch-bend to be sent at least 
the actuation time prior to note-on. Can be done of course, 
but it would take a lot more programming than my method does.
