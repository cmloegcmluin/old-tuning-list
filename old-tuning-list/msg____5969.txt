Subject: 1/4 tones and 1/n "comma" meantones - naming

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

I appreciate the historical use of the 1/n comma meantone term,
yet propose that meantones could more universally be described by
the interval between the fourth and the fifth (i.e. the Large interval).
Although this would result in many tET patterns having more than one
way of deriving and describing them, it would also emphasise their
connection to meantone tunings, rather than giving only some meantones
(another unfortunate term) an implied connection as a hybrid of
Just Intonation.
The other term which needs some definition is what I call the
"Octave Ratio" (which needs definition if other that 2.00000000000...)

Does anyone have a good generic term to describe these spiral or
circular tuning arrangements, which are derived from steps of fourths
in one direction and fifths in the other?
(i.e. other than "meantones" and to include those with Large intervals
greater than 2^(1/6): one of which is usually described as Pythagorean).

TIA for your thoughts

lucy
