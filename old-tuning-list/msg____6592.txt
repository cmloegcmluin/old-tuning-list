I wasn't really talking about keyboard music, but if you want to get into
specifics, it would depend a great deal on the period, the style, the
composer, and so on. If, for example, I was faced with a very plain
keyboard sarabande from circa 1700, you bet I would improvise lots of
melodic filler. Bach himself tends to leave less room for this sort of
thing, as did most composers as you get into the late 18th century.

Perhaps I was not clear enough in my qualifications. I had in mind some
temperaments such as Neidhardt's and Marpurg's divisions of the ditonic
comma. Looking them up in Barbour (who at least comes in handy when
comparing things to 12TET), I see that Marpurg's 1/3 comma temperament is
out at most 6 cents from ET, with a mean deviation of 3 cents. Neidhardt's
1/4 comma is at most 4 cents away, and Marpurg's 1/6 comma has a mean
deviation of only .7 cents!

Now, would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments and
ET on a synthesizer or a harpsichord tuned with electronic help?
Absolutely. Perhaps Ed thought that I was saying the opposite, which I am
not.

Would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments if tuned
by ear counting beats of simultaneous intervals by a skilled tuner who took
his time? Again, yes, I think so.

Would I be able to tell the difference between such temperaments if tuned
by ear of successive intervals, not checking thirds, by a keyboard player
who had a half hour before a rehearsal. Hmm, in that situation I think the
margin for error Marpurg, Neidhardt, and ET will start to overlap.

But let's take a more extreme case, as you suggest, of pure versus ET
intervals. Certainly such differences were quite significant to practical
musicians of that time when tuning harpsichords. But the original question
was about the use of fretted strings in ensembles with harpsichords.

The question then becomes, do those differences create enough dissonance to
be objectionable? Since we have plenty of documentary evidence that lutes,
archlutes, theorbos, and viols often played with harpsichords -- especially
in the 17th century -- the answer has to be either "no" or that
harpsichords were tempered to be at least closer to the fretted strings.

My own feeling is that the objectionability depends on many factors,
including the size of the ensemble and the speed of the music. Certainly
lutes were often used in large ensembles, especially in France and Italy in
the seventeenth century, but I heard a fine performance the other night on
PBS of Purcell trio sonatas and songs accompanied by a harpsichord and an
archlute. While I don't know how they tuned the harpsichord, the result was
lovely.
