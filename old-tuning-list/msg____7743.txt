I agree to a point, but I think that there was at least one other important
criterion that influenced composers -- the relative distribution of the
comma. That is, some wolf-less tunings clearly give more consonance to the
more commonly played keys. The more foreign keys, while still playable,
have relatively more dissonant intervals. This gives pieces in foreign keys
a very different affect or mood that Baroque composers were often
preoccupied with.

However, there are other temperaments in which the "preference" for a
particular key is minor, and the comma is distributed more or less
symmetrically around the circle of fifths. Of course a precisely equal
distribution would be equal temperament, but I'm thinking here of Neidhardt
or Marpurg, whose temperaments, according to Barbour, "all keys are pretty
much alike, whether nearer to C major or F# major."

So, if your point is that a composer will write the same music whether the
temperament is 12TET or 12TET-like, I would have to add the above criterion
(symmetrical distribution of dissonance) to your two conditions on the
definition of 12TET-like. However, I think with that added condition it
applies much more to post-Baroque music than Baroque. I think even Mr.
Well-Tempered Clavier himself suffers when shoe-horned into that most
equally gray of tunings.
