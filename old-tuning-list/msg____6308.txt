Dear Paul Erlich :

 I think you have used guitars fretted in different tunings, and I see you
have a great experience.

 For twenty years I worked very hard with my Dinarra (read Deenarha). That's
a fretted 53 -1/9 skhisma-guitar. Ten acoustic and two electric ones have
been made until now. I have not use any other micro-guitar.

 I am surprised because it seems that all around the world both Didier
Ashour and myself are the only persons in the list that promote the 53
guitar. I don't know if the Didier's instrument is fretted or slide.
 Siemen Terpstra (Holand) (he is not yet in the list) has reported to me his
53 slide guitar.

 Some days ago, somebody in the list said that in the 31 guitar the spaces
between the frets in the zone near the bridge were very closed but in
practice it functions. And I say, in the Dinarra the frets are much closed
and functions well.

 A nephew of mine Johannes Stenger (15) study Dinarra from 11 and plays both
Jazz and European Classics very well. He has a gift.

 And I ask : What are the reasons why 53 is not used as it should ?

 I understand that 53 is the best theoretical proposition for 3 and 5 (90
per cent of the possibilities, just for 5/3-6/5 and tempered 1/9 ninth of a
Skhisma (about 0.2 cent) for 10/9-9/5 and 5/4-8/5). For the other harmonics
the tempering is not bigger than half a comma.
 The sound of the acoustic Dinarra is very warm and much better than the
sound of the original guitar.
