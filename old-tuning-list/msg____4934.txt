No, rational structures are a case of confounded diatonic theory.

The ii chord must often be both or neither. In a I-ii-I progression (common 
in popular music), it is definitely neither. Rational structures fail in 
these cases.

Here, Matt, I wrote a piece where the chord progression is 
I-IV-ii-V-I-IV-ii-V-(ad infinitum). Analyze this piece in Just Intonation. 
How many pitches are implied here? When does the piece return to the home 
key? Are these results going to make any sense for musicians and composers 
working in a meantone temperament (including 12-tET)? Do your 
interpretations have any psychoacoustical manifestations? If not, I maintain 
it's nothing more than playing with numbers. Composing in Just Intonation, 
on the other hand, is a valid enterprise and I have no objection to trying 
to produce diatonic structures in JI. Doing so requires extra care, however.
