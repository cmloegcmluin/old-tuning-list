This seems on its face to be an impossibility. A guitar has its ftets located
to provide a standard ET scale. You need either a movable-fret instrument
like an Indian sitar, or newly located frets.

The book I like best for that is Murray Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament,"
which is probably out of print but may be in a library you can get to. In
this area it is in the GWU library and some others. There are dozens of other
books, no doubt, with this information, however.
