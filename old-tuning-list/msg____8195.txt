Subject: operations over scales (J.Haluska)

From: Jan Haluska <jhaluska@mail.saske.sk>

Hi all,
Let the violinist John feel and play individually the Bach's Air ("On the
string G") in the Pythagorean Tuning. Let the violinist  Jane feel and
play this Air individually in the 1/4-meantone tuning (why not?). We do
not doubt that the professional players John and Jane are able to play
this piece together with pleasure. The question is: IN WHICH TUNING?
More generally: clearly 6+2=8,6-2=4,6:2=3, 6x2=12, etc., where +,-,:,x
are operations over numbers 6 and 2. 
CAN ANYBODY TELL ME SOMETHING OR GIVE A REFERENCE ABOUT OPERATIONS OVER
SCALES? They can be unary(one player), binary (duo), ..., n-ary (the
assembly play). 
Regards,
Jan Haluska
