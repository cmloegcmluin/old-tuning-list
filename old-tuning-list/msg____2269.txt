	Harry Partch had a few things to say about this.  He said that western
art gradually turned from presentations of abstractions to explanations of
abstractions, until the explanation began to "proxy" for the experience
itself.  This is found in musical scores that are impossible to play, as well
as scores that verbally explain what to do.  The art isn't found so much in 
the presentation as the idea.  I think this is fine, but as long as the art is
found in the idea, let's just keep it an idea and not bother with actually
playing the pieces (then Boulez's music could still be popular!)
	Since you mentioned Nancarrow, note how he wrote pieces that are 
impossible to play, but used the player piano to realize those pieces.  His 
music is meant to be HEARD.

	One of my many mottos about music is, If it doesn't SOUND interesting,
it isn't.

	Yeah, I think I was at that lecture.  A Xenakis collaboration with 
Cage (or maybe it was Andy Warhol).  
	Thanks for a very Entertaining and thoughtful posting.
