Subject: RE: Neanderthal

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Yes, Gary, we were saying the same thing in different ways.  The only
exception might be that "visually" at least what I saw was pretty
equidistant.  The odds that the Neanderthal had worked out an "equal
temperament" are larger than the New York Lottery on a high yield night,
though.

Spoofs on April 1st must be more earnestly looked for, I'm afraid.  New
York's Channel 1 on cable started its news segment with Mayor Guiliani
taking Janet Reno's spot in D.C.  It was rendered professionally and
seemed quite believeable...until he said "April's Fools!"

An example that got my craw (and still disappoints me) was an early Ear
Magazine article purporting to divine the tuning used by Benjamin Franklin
in his sole string quartet.  Even aside from the question of authorship of
the string quartet (no longer thought to be Ben Franklin's in
musicological circles), this was a non-April's Fools day article that
pretended 5-limit just intonation for the piece.  

Sadly, I believed this "article," surrounded by a legacy of valuable Ear
articles.  I caught up with the admitted perpetrater at
a La Monte Young concert that we were both performing in.  

La Monte later told me afterward he felt bad that he had taught the
just intonation principles to the "funster" in composition lessons.  The
ideas were lifted and used fancifully under a false name to claim a
false discovery.  Perhaps if he had written his spoof on a clear April
1st I would be more accepting of his deception.
