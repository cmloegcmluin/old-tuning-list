Subject: non-12 rock continued

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

Another great illustration of a 12-eq rock guitarist bending
consistently to produce microtonal intervals is Duane Allman.
Again, like Hendrix, he did not construct any just-intonation
(or tempered, for that matter) theory; he simply used his ear
and long hours of practice to obtain a rich and very expressive
vocabulary of microtonal pitch use.

An excellent and very available example is the slide guitar
part he plays in the original recording of Derek and the
Dominoes "Layla" [1970], from 2:20 to the end.  (This song
can be heard approximately daily on any big-city "classic rock"
station).

There are two slide parts here (in addition to at least two other
electric guitar parts and at least one acoustic part -- truly guitar
heaven) -- the higher part is Allman, the lower is Eric Clapton).

At 5:02, Allman bends a note up approximately a semitone,
holds it for a fraction of a second, then bends up approximately
a semitone higher still, holding it another fraction of a second
before bending back down to the resolution note (the "1"),
getting an awesome wail out of that highest note, which is
VERY non-12-eq.

If anyone could make the music they played on their axe
cry and wail like a voice, it was Duane Allman.
