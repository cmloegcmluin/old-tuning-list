Dan: I agree about Aristoxenos not proposing ET and being the first
cognitive scientist. BTW, Winnington-Ingram has a good discussion of his
tunings in "Aristoxenos and the Intervals of Greek Music." Class. 
Quart. 26: 195-208 (1932).

As for Armenian's being originally Phrygians, recent reclassifications
of the various branches of the Indo-European language family have placed
Armenian with Greek (formerly it was unclassifiable, partly because so
much of the basic vocabulary had been replaced by Iranian, etc.).
The language of the Old Phrygian inscriptions has been considered cognate
to Greek also. 

Greek is now also grouped with Indo-Iranian, despite being a "kentum" 
rather than "satem" language.  (Other newer groupings are Celtic with 
Tokharian and no longer with Italic, and Balto-Slavic with Germanic 
rather than Indo-Iranian.) But, I digress.

I saw a book not too long ago on Turkish Modes (Maqam, by Karl Signell),
but I can't recall whether the scales were quantized to 24-tet or
Pythagorean. I've seentwo different descriptions of Iranian music, 
one in terms of commas, limmas and whole tones, the other in 1/4-tones. 
Unfortunately, "1/4 tone" is also used generically by some authors
for any sort of interval less than a tempered semitone.
