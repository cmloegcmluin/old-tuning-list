Subject: FFT resolution

Perhaps even more useful than resurrecting your programs, could 
you describe in a bit more detail the methods you used? I am 
particularly interested in techniques for getting better resolution (in 
terms of frequency) than the FFT can provide when using a "small" 
window of data.

Thanks,
