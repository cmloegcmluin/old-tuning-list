Subject: El Paso MicroFest

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I've just been informed by Brian McLaren and Erv Wilson that Sonja 
Wayne is organizing an informal microtonal music festival in El Paso, 
TX on  November 8 and 9, 1996. Erv Wilson told me that he will be 
arriving in El Paso from Mexico on Nov. 7th as he will have been 
working on his plant breeding projects in Colonia Pacheco.  Tentative 
attendees also  include Jonathan Glasier, and Neil Haverstick.

Anyone within reasonable driving range should try to make this
meeting. Sonja is arranging private housing and inexpensive meals for 
attendees, so this should be a friendly, low-cost get-together.

Sonja is sending me more information by mail and  I'll post it to the 
List when it arrives.
