Subject: Re: Thai tunings

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

Thanks for putting me straight on the facts, Daniel!  These are
the sort of gems I subscribe to the list to pick up.  Are the
Burmese tunings in that scales list similarly unreliable, then?
There does seem to be a connection, beyond the regional one, and
they do have their characters, albeit not as good as the Thai
one.

Were accurate and reliable measurments ever made to give 7tet
before the era of digital tuners?  It would actually support one
of my own arguments if this were the case.

I repeat my suggestion to you all to tune up that Thai scale.
Whether by accident or design, there is some magic in it.
