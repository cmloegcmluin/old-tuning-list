Since you presume to assert that I have "glossed over" and dismissed
your posts with "total lack of understanding" and since you compound
your folly by seeking to assert that the great Fokker would have fallen
into the gross error into which you have fallen, sir, I am compelled to
explain to you that:

1. Fokker's method is as I have stated. Read the references for
yourself. If you do not have access to Fokker's original texts, use
Mandelbaum.

2. Fokker could have used _no_ method to achieve equal weighting of
deviations of the consonances. The most _basic_ principle of
temperament, which is taught to all _beginners_ in this discipline, is
that there can be _no_ temperament which compromises the consonances
equally. This arises from the mathematics of the case. _Learn_
mathematics before you make such statements, which again, only show your
ignorance.

Now that I have administered the bitter pill, let me add a large
tablespoon of sugar. You are quite bright. You were led into this faulty
conclusion by assuming that the consonances are independent, and so,
vary independently when tempered. I use non-mathematical language here
deliberately. But in fact the consonances consist of three pairs, 5:4 &
8:5, 6:5 & 5:3, and 3:2 & 4:3, each of which pair varies as if it were a
single interval, so far as temperaments are concerned. Therefore, to
seek some system which shall weight deviations from the consonances
equally, even in the case in which the octave is itself tempered, is the
classic pons asinorum of temperament, for no such system can exist. Were
however, you to confine yourself to the narrower (but unfortunately,
perfectly irrelevant) objective of finding a tempered octave which
should deteriorate both of the members of each _pair_ of the consonances
equally, either from just or from their 19-tone equal values,
independent of the other two pairs, then, and then only, would your
objection be valid.

I advise you to study the cycle of 22-tone equal consonant fifths. See
if you can find a consonant third, four fifths above the tonic. If you
cannot (and you cannot) your arguments fall to the ground. I repeat that
when I was a beginner, I made the same mistake you are making.

Your assertion that the chromatic modes of 19-tone equal are just as
well expressible in 12-tone equal, could never be made by anyone who has
heard them, and extensively used them in music with any harmonic
element. Even in melody, and even insofar as the diatonic modes are
concerned, the 12-tone equal modes so deviate from the tonal fabric of
just intonation that they are very evidently deteriorated. But in the
chromatic modes, where the augmented tone is so much used, the
difference is enormous.

Finally, let me observe that the value of 1202.7 cents for the octave,
while apparently very precise, and possibly indicative that one person
may have copied the other without acknowledgement, actually follows from
the decision to round the 19-tone equal tuning degree, 63.16 cents,
upward by the nearest tenth of a cent. 63.2 cents gives an octave of
63.2 x 19 = 1200.8 cents. 63.3 cents gives an octave of 63.3 x 19 =
1202.7 cents. 63.4 cents gives an octave of 1204.6 cents. Back in the
early 90's I settled on the value of 63.3 cents as the value which seems
best when taken to the nearest tenth of a cent. Almost anyone who
thought of tempering the 19-tone octave would be led to 1202.7 cents as
the most eligible of the three values. I repeat that I have no interest
in disputing priority of this discovery. The true credit, insofar as it
belongs to anyone, belongs partly to Fokker, who to my knowledge at
least, first suggested tempering the octave with the purpose of
improving the other consonances. He therefore put the germ of this idea
in my own mind, and it is my habit to make occasional reference to this
as a kind of tribute. This is a very important discovery, for by it the
19-tone equal becomes virtually as smooth harmonically as the 31-tone
equal.

I bear you _no_ personal ill will. I myself _do_ sometimes make bad,
terribly embarassing mistakes. We all do. The best defense against
despising ourselves is to adopt an elaborately civil tone in all public
discourse.
