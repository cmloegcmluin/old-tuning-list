>From what I've seen, there is evidence that a few of the less commonly
used srutis were tempered in order to represent more than one
5-prime-limit ratio. These temperings are often described in terms of
ratios of numbers such as 31, but there is really no more point in
"rationalizing" these compromises than there is in using ratios such as
89/84 for describing 12-tone equal temperament.

BTW, I'm not at all supporting Danielou's mystical claims for the
5-prime-limit.
