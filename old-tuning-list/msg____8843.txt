Almost there...the last batch, to Genovese and Sethares, will be
leaving soon...thanks to all for their patience, it's been a blast, hope
everyone has enjoyed the finished result.
    There's a local radio show, Jazz Tales, which airs Sunday nites on
KUVO in Denver; they took 2 of my tunes from Acoustic Stick, put
original poetry to them, and included them in their last show. What was
even neater was that, on the same show, were 2 tunes from the Mingus
tribute CD, Weird Nightmares, which features someone playing a
Chromelodeon...I believe a number of Partch instruments were used on
this CD. So, in this hour long show, almost 1/4 of it contained non 12
music...I think that's a good thing...Hstick
