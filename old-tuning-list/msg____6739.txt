Subject: A Higher-Level Comment on Gregg Gibson's Limen

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

I and several others have reacted skeptically to some of Gregg Gibson's
recent thoughts.  I think I should state my opinion on this idea of his a
little bit more precisely.
1.  The essential idea he's getting at I don't by any means think to be
    ridiculous or anything like that.  If Gregg's suggestion can be summarized
    that there is a certain level of detail in pitch below which we view their
    melodic effects will be perceived as subtle flavorings of the same original,
    and above which they will be perceived as an essentially different melody,
    then my opinion is that it's an interesting concept.  Proposing that such
    a "limen" exists is a sign of insightfulness in that he's come up with an
    underlying concept I don't recall having been discussed on the list.
2.  It's an interesting concept that could perhaps become a useful rule of thumb
    for composers (e.g., if you're composing something under the assumption
    that the audience will hear at greater resolution than this, you probably
    won't get your idea across).
3.  Despite that, I think it's important to note that its area of direct appli-
    cability is fairly narrow.  (A narrow field of applicability doesn't neces-
    sarily imply unimportance.)  I say that based upon the examples he's given
    and the counterexamples others and I have suggested.  For example, this
    limen has potential applicability to comparatively familiar melodic
    structures like diatonic melodies, but it's more difficult to relate to
    microtonal melodic runs, or to melodies pulled from entirely nontraditional
    scales (e.g., 9TET, 8TET, 11TET, Pierce-Bohlen, and 88CET to name a few).
    Also, its direct applicability to other than melody seems somewhat limited
    as well.
4.  The idea is based upon an assumption of a fairly abrupt change in peoples'
    perception of tuning errors, that change being centered around the limen he
    proposes to be around 60 cents.  Tuning ... "surprises" I'll say ... smaller
    than 30 cents (i.e., to the nearest 60-cent-resolution point) will be viewed
    as coloring of the familiar melody, whereas tuning surprises larger than
    that fundamentally change the melody.  I'm inclined to think that the
    attitude change from melodic coloring to fundamental melodic change is a
    greatly more gradual one.  Standard melodic variation techniques and modal
    changes (for example) show clearly that melodies can undergo some extremely
    enormous permutations before our ears perceived them to be fundamentally
    different.  Given that recognizability of a melody blurs out that far, it
    seems surprising that there would be sharp, sudden changes in attitude
    toward subtle changes.
5.  He seems to suggest that the sub-30-cent coloring effects of a different
    rendition of a diatonic melody are comparatively unimportant.  I don't think
    that the distinction between a familiar melody rendered in, say, QC meantone
    vs. 19TET, vs. Ptolemiac JI are as audibly significant as the variations
    available across entirely nondiatonic frameworks.  But even still, I don't
    think it wise to underestimate the musical impact of those coloring effects.
