Isn't it funny how only 30 years ago, before the "original instruments"
thing got trendy, the fact that "Well" didn't mean "Equal" was all but
forgotten?  Even with armies of musicologists, I'd wager that upwards of 1/3
of the Julliard campus doesn't know the difference to this day.

And the history problem isn't only in conservatories.  Even though I had
read that "Well" was probably Kirnberger 3 almost two years ago, I was
shocked to learn rather recently that Liszt didn't use equal either --
pianos weren't shipping with 12 until after the turn of our century.

Yup.  But not different enough for somebody (like me) who's into extended
Just Intonation.

Right on.  I think it was Jules Siegel who postulated that the return of the
church modes around the turn of the century was a result of equal, which is
an approximation of the 3-limit, whereas the earlier un-equal temperaments
were 5-limit.

And there was some post not too long ago (from you?) about a set of
Beethovan recordings coming out in un-equal.  I'd like to get updated on that.

>observe the different constructions of the WTC 1

And WTC 2.  Bach wrote each Prelude and Fugue pair to fit the
characteristics of the key it was in.  Not "to demonstrate that playing in
all keys was possible", as I have read in many a conservatory circle-> So
much for all "interpretations" based on that!

Seldom discussed is the fact that each of the "exotic ET's" have as many
un-equal counterparts as does 12 tone.

The closest thing I know of to a unified goal was the Xenharmonic one, and
that was simply to find something DIFFERENT.  Not necessarily more pure.

As far as contrast between pure and dissonant, nothing is as good as Just
Intonation, as Partch had to say again and again.  The variations between
consonance and dissonance in even the most un-equal temperament is aneamic
compared to what is possible with a good Just tuning (number of pitches
being the same).
