Thanks for correcting me on that.

   Oh, by the way, here's a side-note for you clarinet fans:  I picked up a
recording some of you might be interested in.  A little known fact is that
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and the Quintets were written for an instrument
somewhat different from the modern Bb/A soprano.  That instrument could perhaps
be described as a hybrid of the usual soprano with a basset horn.  (The basset
horn is kind of like the modern alto clarinet except that it's in F instead of
Eb, and - much more importantly - its bore diameter is essentially the same as
that of the soprano.)  

   The instrument that Mozart wrote these works for was essentially a soprano
clarinet with its low end range extended down something like a major third or
perhaps a P4 (it's hard to tell from the pictures).  I already had a CD of the
quintets done on an original instruments' implementation of this instrument
(AMON RA CD-SAR-17), but I hadn't heard the Concerto performed this way.  I
don't have the CD with me, so I can't locate the numbers and such, but it's
performed by David Shifron as I recall.  

   The performance of the Concerto was pretty good, and was interesting because
of the spots where the usual score goes up an octave to accomodate the smaller
range of the modern instrument - he doesn't do that here.  But the performance
of the quintets isn't as impressive on my opinion.  There are places where the
expressivity is kind of lacking, and I got the frequent sense that the quartet
was trying to slow Shifron down and the reverse.
