Subject: Semiconductor analog to phonons

From: "Brian M. Ames" <bmames@apk.net>

There is in semiconductor theory a conceptual particle called a "hole" which
represents the absence of an electron in the lattice of the substrate.  It
has the same properties as an electron except opposite charge and direction.
Likewise, a particle called a "phonon" can be conceived.  It would have
properties derived from the medium in which the sound traveled; in air it
would essentially be a nitrogen molecule. Since the collisions between
molecules are not perfectly elastic, phonons would "tire out" and stop
moving as their energy dissipated.  They would not obey quantum laws which
in any event become insignificant in the large collections of particles
which is the domain of sound.

Just as semiconductor holes cannot travel beyond the boundary (juncture) of
the substrate, phonons would not be able to travel between media.  They
would instead transfer their energy to phonons in the other media at the
juncture. And, of course, phonons would not be able to cross empty space as
photons do.

Do phonons exist?  Yes, to the extent the concept is useful.

Is it a useful concept? This is uncertain.
