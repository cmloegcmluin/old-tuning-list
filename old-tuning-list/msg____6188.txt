If we see it from the STRICT Tuners point of view, that's right, and I
enter between "the most tuning enthusiasts" (Please Gary put me into the
list :-) ). Yes !!! this is the matter I have worked in my free-time for no
less than 30 years.
There are also others points of view.
- The 12 semitonic intervals are closed in 13 notes. This happens in the
note-book.
- In the piano, the white keys per Octave are 8.
- In the staff, in any key, we must count 8 notes to find the note-symbol of
a note one Octave appart.

As a mathematical concept all of this occur from the use of a Ordinal Scale
instead of a Scalar Scale. The Ordinal begins with 1 (one) and the Scalar
from 0 (zero). Ordinal comes from "orden" that means "order",

It seems there is a happy (or not) coincidence between the zero as a pitch
difference and the zero of the Scalar Scale. One physical, the other
mathematical. Ellis (Helmholtz p.13-d) define the concept of Intervals.

 The ordinal numbers (distances) such as Fourth, Fifth, Octave, are
Ordinals. NOTES are counted. And in the case of 7, 12, 19, INTERVALS (or
Chromatic notes) are counted.


Thanks Gary,
