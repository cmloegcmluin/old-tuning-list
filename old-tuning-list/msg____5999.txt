   I have seen two renditions of a huge list of historically-significant
intervals.  One was from my late mentor in the field, Ivor Darreg.  The
other I suspect although I may be mistaken, was posted on the list by
Manuel Op de Coul.

   Do I remember correctly, Manuel?


   This discussion, however, suggests the need for more than one general
type of term:
1.  Terms for intervals with exact values, like what Ivor Darreg and I
    personally think to be the preferable definition of a syntonic comma, which
    is 81:80.
2.  Terms for intervals by ... "mechanism" for lack of a better word, like what
    Paul Rapoport feels to be the best definition a syntonic comma:  The pitch
    difference between dominant of the dominant and the submediant of the
    subdominant (or other equivalent formulations).  The point here being that
    many different tuning systems will each have their own values for syntonic
    commas.
3.  Terms for intervals by approximate pitch range, like "subminor third",
    meaning a third that is roughly mid-way between a minor third and a
    diminished third.  Some feel that semitone and quartertone fit in this
    category rather than the first.
4.  A special case, but an important one, of #3:  Terms for intervals ideal
    intervals and their approximations, the obvious example being "perfect
    fifth", meaning 3:2 and its various historically-significant approximations.
