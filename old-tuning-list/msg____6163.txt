Subject: Re: TUNING digest 1189

From: Erich Neuwirth  <neuwirth@smc.univie.ac.at>

i wrote a multimedia document (book+cdrom)
about the mathematical foundations
of musical tuning systems.

Erich Neuwirth
Musical Temperaments
Springer-Verlag
ISBN 3-211-83040-5

it is a college level introductory text,
target audience also nonmajors in music.

it will be available in about 2 weeks.

meanwhile, you can have an eye and ear at an electronic brochure
with a music example played in different tunings
(through the midi part of you gm compliant sound card).
windows 95 and nt only, sorry for that.

this brochure is available at

http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/musicfun/tundemo/

at this sunsite, you also can find a web based implementation
of mozart's dice minuet (which is not about tuning,
but good musical fun).

and some more musical stuff.

feedback is welcome.
