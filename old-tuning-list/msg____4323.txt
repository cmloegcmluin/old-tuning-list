Subject: mod groups & rhythm

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Jim Kukula's thoughts on similarities between rhythmic and frequency
proportions strikes me as creative thinking - applying ideas in one aspect
of music to another.  That's valuable.  

   I suspect though that pitch and rhythm are fundamentally different when
it comes to temperament.  Tempering pitches is meaningful because our ears
hear in a manner that could perhaps be described as simultaneously in
linear and logarithmic frequency scales.  

   For example, octaves have meaning both as 4/3s of a perfect fifth's span
of linear frequency, and also as (roughly) 12/7s of a perfect fifth's span
on a logarithmic frequency.  That first formulation relates those two
intervals by their JI, whole-number-ratio basis, and the second formulation
relates the two by their perceived pitch distance as is useful for weighing
them in building a scale.  

   While we'll all agree that fundamental rhythmic structures show very
clear proportions on a linear time or note-rate scale, I doubt if there is
much intuitive meaning to a logarithmic time or rate scale.
