I found the Reyburn Cyber Tuner on the web, but I could not find the
Sanderson Accu-tuner.  Does anybody know where to get information on this?

Am familiar with the Korg and Peterson, but have never seen teh Accutone or
Precision Strobe Tuner models.  Could anybody point me in the right direction?

As far as a wish list goes, the smaller, simpler, and lighter, the better.
Perhaps ideal would be a device without any scale template at all, just
entry for cents and some rotating LED's.  It is always nice to have
reference tones to compare the visual feedback to something you can hear.
In fact, it would be really cool just to have a hand-held, battery powered
device that only gave reference pitches (that is, had no listening
capability) at a given frequency in hertz.

The Violab Pitchman is such a tuner, and it can be purchased from Zuckermann
harpsichords at http://www.zuckermann.com/earlykeyboardnotes/pitchman.html/,
but it is stuck to one of several preset temperaments.  I have this tuner
and it is really cool.  I have corresponded with the guy who makes this
tuner about the idea of hertz entry, and he told me to buy a peice of lab
equipment from http://www.telulex.com/.  I looked into this, but eventually
decided that the Peterson 520 was better suited to my needs.  I have this
tuner and it is okay.  But, when it comes down to it, strobes have got to
suck.  And, big heavy boxes do not make me happy.
