Subject: Good Auditory Website

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Check out this auditory website

http://www.music.mcgill.ca/auditory/Auditory.html

Also, thanks Johnny for the lurker invitation. Some interesting people 
are lurking here! Although I contribute thoughts from time to time, I 
have never introduced myself, so I will take the demi-lurker's 
prerogative and compose a short introduction.

	I am a recovering professional musician (12tet for the money for 
20 years) finishing a long overdue PhD in mathematics (dynamical systems 
and chaos) at the University of Colorado at Denver. I am also a luthier 
but I now confine my practice almost exclusively to microtonal guitars 
and basses (PaulE take note--I am getting the parts order wrapped up this 
thurs!). I once won Guitar Player Magazines weirdest guitar contest for a 
combination ant farm Telecaster (the Ant-o-caster, what else?) that had 
pickups for the ant sounds in addition to the regular pickups. Tommy 
Tedesco was the last known owner. Does anyone know where it is now?
I currently play bass for the Neil Haverstick Band (19, 31, 34 et) and am 
writing an article on just tuning schemes for the justly fretted 
StarrBoard, a chromatic-string, chromatic-fret tapping matrix (see 
Experimental Musical Instruments Dec. 1990 and 1/1 Feb. 1991).

	There. That wasn't so hard. How about you other lurkers and non 
lurkers. Who are you and what are you doing? 

John Starrett
