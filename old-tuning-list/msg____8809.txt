Ok, that's right. But I was talking about temperaments with only a few
tempered fifths. Let's say three or less. Werckmeister III has four, the other
ones you mention five or six.
At least I'm not aware of any with three or less which have consecutive tempered
fifths. This would lead to harmonic waste, doesn't it?
