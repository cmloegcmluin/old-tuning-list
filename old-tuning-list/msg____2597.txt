Subject: Amusing Quote

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I can't recall which, but one of the generals of the American Civil War
readily admited that he was utterly and completely tonedeaf.  He was quoted as
saying that he recognized only two tunes:  One of them was Yankee Doodle, and
the other, he said, was not.  

   I didn't grasp how bloody that war was until I saw the PBS documentary
series.  On one battle, about 7000 men died in just under two minutes.  Yow!

   Sorry, I'm off the subject, but I thought that quote amusing.  I've met a few
people like that!
