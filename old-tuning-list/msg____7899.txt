I picked up a new CRI re-release of Ezra Sims music
on CD yesterday. It's in the CRI American Masters 
series, CD 784. Material originaly from CRI SD 223 & CRI SD 377.

Contains:

"String Quartet (1932)" for flute, clarinet, violin, viola & cello.
(1974)

Elegie - nach Rilke for soprano and ensemble (1976)

Third Quartet (1962) for string quartet

It sure is nice to have these on CD.    :)
