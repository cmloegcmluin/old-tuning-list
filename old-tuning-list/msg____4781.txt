Subject: more cheese please

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <CXL03253@niftyserve.or.jp>

Excuse me if this subject is too far away from the theme of this list but 
would like to know more about the "Philly Cream Cheese" thing that Mr. Szanto 
& Mr. Wolf mentioned couple of weeks ago.
I was talking over this with the chief-editor of "Wired(Japan)" magazine and 
he got quite interested in the microtuned music and this list itself. He's the
 
kind of person who would ask " Is that microtuning thing one of the subliminal
 
effects?" so I will have to tell him a lot especially why the fact that this 
sort of music being used in TV-CM is that much exciting.
And now I making researches to find out what the "Philly Cream Cheese" is and 
who really is the composer of the music. At first, I thought that "Philly" was
 
the name of the company.......is this correct? I tried Yahoo, Excite & Hotbot 
but the best result was the URL of the restaurants.
Could someone kindly tell me where i should access to......if they are the 
existing company their public-affairs section (?) would be the best....I think
.

Any good ideas?

Thanx
