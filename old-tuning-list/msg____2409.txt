Subject:  Yamaha VL-1M and VL-7

   The Yamaha VL-7/VL-1M physical modelling
synthesizers implement tuning in a weird way.
Here's the skinny:
  You can't edit the 2 user tuning table I01 and I02.
Instead, you have to edit them on a TG-77 or SY-77
or on JICalc, then do a sys-ex dump to the VL-7/
VL-1M.
  Why Yamaha chose to implement microtuning this
way is beyond me.  It certainly makes it less
convenient to retune the instrument.  As a plus, 
user tunings are reportedly stored with the 
instrument patches and are loaded from the disk
automatically.
  The way Yamaha implements physical modelling
on the instrument is also peculiar and worth a 
metnion.  The physical model is fixed: a blown tube.
To get a Karplus-Strong plucked string sound (typified
by the fretless bass and sitar patches), the physical
model's mouthpiece is connected to its output.  A 
kludge--but one that works.  A recirculating system
is created which, with appropriate losses for
acoustic admittance, mimcs the Karplus-Strong
algorithm pretty well.
  To get a vibrating string, the tube is apparently
shrunk down to near-zero width.  The resulting
one-dimensional tube subs for a vibrating string
and apparently also allows the user to apply a
mouthpiece with "embrouchure" to the vibrating
string--something not possible with a standard
Hiller-Ruiz vibrating string physical model or
the classic Julius Smith waveguide physical
model of the string.
  Rumor has it that Yamaha has a MAX patch 
available that'll allow users to completely
change the internal physical model.  Instead
of being limited to a blown tube, the user can
dunk with internal VL-7 parameters and specify
any acoutsical system desired.  Apparently, the
MAX patch comes with a WARNING -- KNOWLEDGE
of PHYSICAL ACOUSTICS IS REQUIRED TO USE
THIS EDITOR.  Apparently it's easy to specify
an acoustic system which *cannot* produce
sound output. (Arthur Benade called these
things "tacit horns."  Nice design, no sound.)
  Does anyone have any knowledge of this
mythical MAX patch?  As a xenharmonizing
future VL-7 owner, this question is of
some interest
