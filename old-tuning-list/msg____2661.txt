There is a possible intermediate solution- certain PowerMacs are "DOS
compatible", meaning they have a card with a 486 of unknown speed running in
parallel to the PowerPC.  You can switch from DOS/Windows mode to Mac mode
and back with command-enter, and in fact start a job running under DOS and
switch back to the Mac while it's running.  My Dad has one of these machines
and we managed to get a Windows-based mapping program and the Ensoniq ESP2
assembler working on it just fine.  Scala should work too since its I/O is
pretty generic.  Of course if you don't happen to have a Mac with this
option it wouldn't do you any good, but from what I hear it's a not uncommon
machine around academic computing centers and studios.
