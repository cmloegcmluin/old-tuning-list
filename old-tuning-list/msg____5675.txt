Subject: Octaves not exactly 2^N

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

In the past year I have measured twelve Javanese Gamelan in Germany. While
this is not a large sample, I have not detected a preference for stretched
over diminished octaves in the tuning of the gamelan as a whole. Exceptionally, slendro instruments with both a low and a high pitch one
will almost always have stretched octaves, while those with two pitch sixes
almost always diminish the octave. Marc Perlman reports from his tuner that the octaves can be stretched to
cover singers who tend to go sharp in the upper octaves - a rationale
entirely different from the acoustical explainations most often given.
Using the  spectrum analysis feature of Pitch Perfect (which is admitedlybuggy), I have been unable to obtain very consistant patterns in the
frequency ratios of the partial tones. Yes, they are stretched from an
integer series but in a rather haphazard way depending largely on the shape
of the key, and so I would be very hesitant to endorse any explaination of
the tuning based upon the timbre of the instruments other than one in which
the general inharmonicity allows a greater degree of latitude. A difference
tone theory like that of Wilson remains, to my ears at least, plausible. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
