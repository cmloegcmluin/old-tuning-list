  Sorry everyone. I should have calculated before asking questions. What I had
 in mind was the potentiality of using the circle of 7:4s instead of 3:2s. And
 if the double 88s could mean something similar to that.....ah! have to calcul
ate again.....anyway...it wasn't circle at last! So it means getting rid of th
e octaves will bring in a good chance for each equal tempered notes becomming 
a root of a well tuned chord, doen't it? Is this just a FAQ? Maybe it is. Sorr
y again!

  By the way, in Japan, a book called "MAGICAL MAX TOUR" came out this week. I
s someone trying retuned music on MAX? Is that kind of thing possible?
   
  Thanx for your reply.
