O.K. as we cant really agree at a place, how about planning two
conferances a year or two years apart. Someone picks a number,sends it
to Robin Perry , someone from L.A. picks one and someone from San Diego
another, closest one wins first year conferance. Also I propose that the
L.A. take place at Bill Alves location with one or two events taking
place in the city open to the public organized by me truly. Lets get to
work and do it for gods sake!
