Subject: Tomes's and Haverstick's universal patterns.

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

I tend to agree that the harmonic patterns may be able to
reveal many other patterns in the universe, yet I feel that
using WNR logic may be complicating matters, whereas a simple
spherical motion analysis a la Harrison may be more productive.

{Yes, I will get back to Matt N's comments, when I have run the
experiments and written up the methods that I use.}

In the 1700's John "Longitude" Harrison wrote a book about
musical tuning and navigation.
The biography of his life, "Longitude", by Dava Sobel is
currently in the worldwide bestsellers.
 
We have taken Harrison's musical ideas and used them to
produce a cassette album of microtuned world lullabies.
 
Every lullaby is traditional and instrumental.
Lyrics, sheetmusic. and teaching aids for music and geography
are included in the package.
