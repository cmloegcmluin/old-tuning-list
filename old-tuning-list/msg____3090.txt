Subject: Real-time MIDI JI on the Web

From: jmax@interport.net (John Maxwell Hobbs)

Hello everyone,

I have put up a new MIDI file "Chimes" at the Cinema Volta Web Page at
http://www.users.interport.net/~jmax.  "Chimes" is in Just Intonation, but
can be played without the use of special tuning tables.  You will need the
Crescendo! plug-in for Netscape 2.0 (or better) and some sort of General
MIDI player to play this.  Just follow the instruction on the page.
