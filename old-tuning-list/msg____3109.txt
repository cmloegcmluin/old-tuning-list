Subject: Re: Post From McLaren re Reinhard

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Actually there is a Universe Symphony version by Larry Austin that is 
essentially a fantasy on some of the ideas of Charles Ives, but it 
dramatically different from my realization which adds no new notes to the 
sketches left by Ives.  Since Mr. Austin took 20 years to make his 
"completion" most people compare my work to his, never looking at the 
original material left by Ives.  For this and other reasons I thought 
maybe it was a time to make a report of the concert.

The performance at Alice Tully Hall was by most reports about 85% full 
and there was a 4 minute standing ovation for the 74 minutes of music 
heard.  A rush at the box office forced Lincoln Center to ask for us to 
start late, by about 25 minutes.

I am might proud of my orchestra of 71 players and 2 assisting 
conductors: the recording demonstrates _sans doubt_ that this performance 
beautifully represents my score of the transcendental masterpiece (now 
being debated in a described "firestorm" by music critics).  The Ives 
Society had previous to the concert already analyzed my score and 
described it as "admirable."  I was told to use the phaseolgy "realized 
by Johnny Reinhard exclusively on Ives' Universe Symphony sketches" on 
all publicity, to demonstrate that what one hears is what Ives devised, 
and not another musical entity.

The transcendental factor - as well as visual "dissonance" interfered 
with some listeners.  The piece has no breaks: 10 cycles of percussion 
divisions of a basic unit of 16 seconds is divided equally into whole 
numbers from 1 up to 43.  The opening "Prelude of the Cosmos" played by 
13 percussionists in what was the most literal of all instructions by Mr. 
Ives, is devilishly disorienting.  This lengthy half-hour prelude is the 
portal by which a listener enters a fantastic original time frame.  My 
4-square beat is not heard in the music!  Some challenged my tempo of 16 
seconds for a basic unit.  Yet this is the indication in the sketch (Mr. 
Austin thinks Ives made a mistake).  After hearing the recording no one 
has suggested changing the tempo at all.  Put simply, 2 listening are 
required by Mr. Ives to reach the transcendent level he called "parallel 
listenings."  

Of course, 2 live performances in a row would have been too much for an 
orchestra playing 21st century music...81 years old.  Most didn't believe 
that one could feel such a slow tempo.  More accurate is the difficulty 
with which one hears Ives' Universe Symphony.  After a couple of 
listenings - again, demanded by Ives in his Memos, in case someone would 
finish his work if he couldn't get to it - one apprehends a fast piece.  
There is an constant cycling of a triplet of notes that is as celestial - 
or cosmic - a sensation as I've experienced.  Jon Catler shares all of 
this, as does a good share of people.  

Intonationally, this was beyond dispute.  No one has ever brought it up.  
The New York Times review of 6/8/86 titled BELLS AND MICROTONES - A 
LEGEND COMES TO LIFE.  Ives was very clear in his writings that an Fb was 
lower than an E and accordingly, sharps are higher than flats.  There 
were microtonalisms on this level throughout the piece.

This work was not easy listening.  But for those that come to the work 
openly and not critically are in for a real treat.  I mean critically in 
terms of a left-brainish focus on a detail and missing the forest for a 
tree.  The rewards of listening to this piece will take years before it 
is available commerically, frustratingly so due to several unions that 
are involved (commercial release is a whole different level of payment), 
and even Licoln Center itself.  $150,000 ought to do it.  I am able, 
however, to use this recording for grants for the American Festival of 
Microtonal Music (AFMM). :)

Being a live premiere that was demanding to the Nth degree for each 
musician, there were surprises.  The disorientation factor worked on the 
musicians that felt like making early entrances.  On the recording this 
is beyond notice.  The audience was exceptionally quiet and the recording 
sparkles and shimmers, though the universe is a bit complex.
