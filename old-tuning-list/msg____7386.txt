I think you're right that Kubrick used "Lontano" (I'm not positive,
though), and I have have the score -- it's very dense, but I
haven't seen any microtones in it; looks like it's all 12-eq clusters.

I'm pretty sure, however,  that some of the Penderecki pieces
in "The Shining" *do* have microtones.
