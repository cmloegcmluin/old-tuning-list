Subject: MICROSTOCK 2

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...MICROSTOCK 2 is set this year for October 19th, in
Lindsay Auditorium, on the campus of Denver University, at 8:00PM.
The concert features the Haverstick Band playing 19 tone and 34 tone
music, with special guests the Catler Brothers from NYC, doing music
in a just intonated system of 49 notes to the octave.

Besides the concert, there are 2 other related events: on October 17,
from 6-8 PM, I'll be giving a class on beginning microtonal concepts
at Swallow Hill Music Association, 1905 S. Pearl; I'll have my 19, 31,
and 34 tone guitars on hand as well. Then, on October 18, from 2-7
PM, John Starrett and friends, including Jack Douthett, Richard Krantz,
and Harry Fleishman, will be presenting a series of talks titled the
Science of Music...this takes place on the Auraria Campus, in North
Classroom bldg. room # 1535.

We are quite delighted that MICROSTOCK is 2 years old, and plan for it
to get much older. Please contact me at 303-477-3268, or Starrett at
303-477-5309 for any further info. Oops, I almost forgot our Web site:
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret...there will be info, as well
as sound bites from last years gig. It would be great for some of you
forum members to show up...it looks to be a neat 3 days...Hstick
