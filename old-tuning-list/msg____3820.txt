Or perhaps people don't use ANY notation if they can avoid it. Those of 
us who use non-realtime instruments might need some sort of chart or 
table to help in making a piece, but a detailed score seems superfluous. 
Of course, the situation may be different where performers are involved 
but I find it a tremendous relief not to have to bother with it.
