Subject: 19tet vs. meantone?

From: "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com>

Thanks for the warm welcome, folks.

I'm not really a schooled musician, but I'm a bright guy and I've read a
bit.  Over the past two years or so I've developed a new diatonic tuning for
the pedal steel.  Please take a moment to look at it at the following web
page:

http://wco.com/~quasar/tunings/fscale12.htm

Notice the tempering chart midway down the page.  I tune the instrument with
a Korg tuning meter that shows the number of cents from 12TET at A440.

Now, my understanding is that this is meantone temperment.  Most of my
steel-playing friends draw a blank on the word "meantone".  The temperment
debate among steel guitarists is quite simple: JI vs. 12TET (though they
call them by different names.

My first question: is my temperment meantone, or is it something else?  It
sounds real pretty but I know it's not JI.

After reading in this group about 19TET (I'd never heard of it until a week
ago!), I've come to realize that it would be fairly easy to retune my
diatonic steel to it.  I'd have to paint myself a 19 tone fretboard - that
sounds like fun, actually.  Tuning the strings, pedals and knee levers would
be a snap with my Korg tuner.

I wonder if anyone here would care to speculate on how it would sound.  In
particular, would the harmonies ring as nicely as they do in my current
(meantone?)temperment?  Or should I expect it to sound a little rougher?

I'd be happy to answer any questions about the pedal steel.  I've been
playing for over 25 years, and I write for the various pedal steel
publications occassionally.  I personally feel that it's the most versatile
instrument for microtonal music, and I'm always disappointed that it isn't
used outside of country music as often as it could be.
