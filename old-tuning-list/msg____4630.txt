''It is these sorts of experiments that lead me to quarrel with Daniel Wolf

solution, and never to the subharmonic one.''

This is a poor comparison (10 : 12 : 15 : 17) against ( /6 : /5 : /4 :
2/7). The first wins whether with sine waves or with strings. Try these
inversions instead: (17/2 : 10 : 12 : 15 ) against  ( /7 : /6 : /5 : /4 ).
My own preference (and that of my three-and-a-half year old son who has
heard more gamelan pelog than any other live music) in this second set
whether with sine waves or more complex timbres is always for the
subharmonic version. I thinkl that the inversion chosen plays a large role
in the harmonic-subharmonic distinction. The 10:12:15:17 ''locks in'' to
it's tuning through the doubled difference tone (5). 

And need I repeat for the nth time, that I chose sine waves for my spacing
work to avoid the whole issue of masking tones whose spectra shared too
many partials, thus obscuring which tones were fundamentals.
