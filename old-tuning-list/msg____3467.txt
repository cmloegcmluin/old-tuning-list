Subject: The Partch Religion ?

From: "Enrique Moreno" <eig@ccrma.stanford.edu>

Check it for yourself:

+ There is a Founder, who is the prophet for the Ultimate Truth
+ There is the Ultimate Truth and Ground of all things (namely, Just
Intonation)
+ There are the Disciples and many would-be initiates
+ There is a corpus of Sacred Writings 
+ There is a book containing The Teachings
+ There are the Sacred Relics made by the Founder himself
+ There are ritual meetings to celebrate the Mysteries
+ There are Orthodox, Liberal, and Puritan Theologians
+ There are rival sister religions, and ancient pagan cults
+ There are detractors and persecutions of the faithful
+ There are also heretics who deny either the approved liturgy or the
validity of some crucial dogma
+ There are atheists who don't believe in the Ultimate Ground of all things
(let alone in the Master)
+ Item plus, there are skeptics who think that both believers and
unbelievers are right (or wrong)
+ There are converts and apostates, who have either found or lost their
faith in both the Ultimate Truth or its Prophet
+ There are also sympathizers and curious, who would like to know more
about the Master and the Ultimate Truth of all things
+ There are scientists who despise this religion and call it numerology
+ Item there are other scientists who uphold that this religion and science
are not at odds
+ There are zealots and counter-revolutionaries whose main objective is the
destruction of the hegemony of the 12-tone-equal-temperament, and who will
pragmatically ally with the faithful just to undermine the
12-tone-equal-temperament status quo. 
+ Then there is the great and indifferent World at large, who immerse in
the darkness of 12-tone-equal -temperament doesn't even know about any of
the above (or care to know) 

	There are also real religions ...  :)

Op maandag 26 augustus is er om 20.00 u. in het programma Supplement
op radio 4 een vier uur durend portret van de op 31 mei j.l. overleden 
componist Ton de Leeuw. In de uitzending wordt aandacht besteed aan de
componist, de docent, de denker en door de jaren heen een stuwende
kracht in het Nederlandse muziekleven.
Hij heeft wat 31-toonsmuziek geschreven en ook muziek in gamelanstemming
maar of de programmamakers hem eren door deze muziek uit te zenden weet
ik niet.
Mijn oog valt nu op de aankondiging van een programma op dezelfde dag om
14.00 uur welk uit het oogpunt van stemmingen interessant zou kunnen zijn
en dat gaat over Georgische en Koptische kerkzang met revolutionaire
herinterpretaties van wat gewoonlijk Gregoriaans genoemd wordt. Meer onder.


There is a radio programme next Monday about the deceased composer 
Ton de Leeuw on Dutch radio 4 at 20.00 h. Whether he will be honoured
with the playing of his 31-tone works or works in gamelan tuning, I don't
know.
Another programme the same day at 14.00 h. is about Georgian and Koptic (sp?)
church chant. I have heard Koptic church chant on the radio before and
I found it impressive music with a definitely microtonal and exact 
intonation. Is there a list member who knows more about the intervals of
this chant?
