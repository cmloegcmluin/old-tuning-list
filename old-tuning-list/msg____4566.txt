Subject: building an mbira

From: Adam Silverman <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

This is a question for all of you master-craftspersons out there.  I have
decided to have a fancy mbira custom-built for my music, and before I jump
into it, I would like to know if anyone here has done this and can offer
any advice regarding design specifications.  I would like to have a
double-level style like those found in Zimbabwe (do we say Rhodesia?) but
probably a second tier on either side.  I don't know why they usually are
only double-tiered on the left.  I am also wondering if a fine-tuning
mechanism could be devised, better than just wiggling the tongues back and
forth while hoping for the best.

Any advice?
