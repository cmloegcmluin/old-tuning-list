Paul R,

What symbol did I use multiply?

I'd be happy to clear this up, but I don't see what your complaint is 
directed at.

That's precisely the point. In a case, like 20tet, where the two approaches 
lead to different results, then the tuning is simply not compatible with a 

just-intonation view. Defining a "best" size for the syntotic comma is 
futile in such systems. The precedence of 1:5 over 3:5 seems consistent with 
an Euler-Fokker, or square lattice, philosophy but not an Erv Wilson, or 
triangle lattice, philosophy. I have investigated the relationship between 
the two approaches in terms of lattices and made some geometrical 
discoveries in the process. Both approaches extend to any number of 
dimensions -- perhaps I'll write a paper on this someday. Paul, I guess your 
notation system succeeds within the Euler-Fokker philosophy, but I lean 
towards a more egalitarian one.

Ah, I'll bet this derives from his desire to preserve standard notation of 
diminished scales. See his PNM article.
