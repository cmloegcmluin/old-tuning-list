Nobody was questioning that air could transmit vibrations--that's what
sound is, after all.  The original question was _can a string be set
into significant vibrating motion by air vibrations alone?_  Examples
involving tubes, or strings mechanically coupled to soundboards or
other strings, do not help resolve this question.

A simple experiment that _would_ resolve the question is this: sing at
an electric guitar at a pitch matching one of the strings.  Note the
level of the output and compare vs. a gentle pluck.  I'll bet it's
several orders of magnitude (bels) lower.  Surely someone out there has
an electric guitar handy?
