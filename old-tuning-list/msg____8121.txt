From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

Those of us who do algorithmic composition might find this ... uhmmm
"interesting" to put it euphemistically.

>> U.S. Patents via NewsEdge Corporation : Abstract: A system and process for
>> comprising a musical section in response to a user's interaction with a
>> multimedia presentation is disclosed. The system includes a composition
>> engine, performance engine, and arbitrator. The arbitrator provides an
>> interface with an application program running a multimedia presentation.
>> The arbitrator receives parameters from the application program indicative
>> of a user's interaction and the type of music the application program
>> requests in response to the interaction. The parameters are passed to the
>> composition engine which composes a musical section having a chord
>> progression and other data therein. The musical section and a style
>> provided by the arbitrator are used by the performance engine to generate
>> music sequence data for driving a musical instrument. The performance of
>> the musical sequence data by the musical instrument occurs substantially
>> contemporaneously with the user's interaction which caused the musical
>> section composi
>>
>> tion. Because the composition engine uses processes which vary the
>> composition of musical sections, the user events which initiate
>> composition of a musical section and which occur at the same place within
>> a multimedia presentation, still vary the performance at each user event.
>>
>> Ex Claim Text: A system for composing music in response to a user's
>> interaction with a multimedia presentation comprising: an application
>> program interface for receiving parameters identifying a style, a shape,
>> and a personality for music that conform to said user's interaction with
>> said multimedia presentation; and a composition engine for composing a
>> musical section corresponding to said parameters so that a user perceives
>> the performance of the musical section to be related to said user's
>> interaction with said multimedia presentation.
