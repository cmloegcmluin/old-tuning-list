Subject: Fractal music?

From: Dr_Orient <jma9183@garnet.acns.fsu.edu>

I saw a post on alt.sci.fractals (I think) where someone was asking if
any composers now were pursuing the idea of Mandelbrot sets,
quaternions, complex numbers, etc., in musical expression, and in
particular if anyone was pursuing an expression of Schrvdinger's Theorem
in music. For most of these concepts, I confess to being mathematically
challenged; I like the beauty of them, once I understand them, but such
understanding is a very new (and tenuous) thing for me. I thought
someone here might have explored such ideas, or be interested in
applying them. I've got an intuition they apply to tuning, but I am
definitely not articulate enough to say what any relationship might be.
Anyone have any thoughts or speculations?
