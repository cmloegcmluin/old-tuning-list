Well, maybe we won't agree to disagree just yet.

>"Best" has a strict mathematical, as opposed to musical definition.
>Consequently, the most desirable musical result may conflict.

Exactly. Here's the implicit derivation of your strict mathematical 
definition: the syntonic comma is (3:2)^4/(5:4) (ignoring octaves); 
therefore the best syntonic comma is 4 times the best perfect fifth minus 
the best major third, mod the number of notes per octave. Another, just as 
musically relevant and just as mathematically strict, definition would be: 
the syntonic comma is (3:2)^3/(5:3) (again ignoring octaves); therefore the 
best syntonic comma is 3 times the best perfect fifth minus the best major 
sixth, mod the number of notes per octave. If the two definitions lead to a 
conflict, I see no reason one should take precedence. Therefore, in such 
cases, there is no "best" syntonic comma.

I'd be interested in hearing more about this.

To behave properly is to behave as in just intonation. In just intonation, 
cycles of P5 don't close or form just M3s, so there is no inherent reason to 
expect equal temperaments to behave this way. In just intonation, a M3 plus 
a m3 is a P5, so this is a reasonable expectation of any equal temperament 
in which we hope to use 5-limit harmony. If this expectation is not 
fulfilled, don't use 5-limit symbols to notate that equal temperament. Or if 
you do, at least don't call them "best."

Neither do I. In fact, I think your method achieves the goals of being both 
"general" and "standard." Using new symbols for various alterations is fine, 
but naming them after various commas is useful only when the relevant 
structural characteristics of the tuning mirror those of just intonation. 
Otherwise it is just misleading. You didn't address my point about 
fractional alterations, which seem just as necessary, and often at least as 
meaningful, as the "commas," and my request to clarify your criticism of 
Herf's and Sims' notations. What wrong with using lots of fractional 
alterations, whose ordering is intuitive, combined with an understanding of 
how they represent the syntonic comma, septimal comma, etc., as opposed to 
using combinations of 12-based commas, with possibly bizarre orderings, 
combined with an understanding of how these commas may fail to fulfill their 
acoustical functions?
