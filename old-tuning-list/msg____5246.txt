John, I feel the effects of music, though sometimes extremely apparent,
more often are on the level of tobacco smoke or asbestos--occasional
exposure having seemingly little effect, some not being effected at all,
while long term exposure seems to eventually have drastic consequences.

I hope that interested individuals won't be kept from reading David Tame's
book based on several of the posted reviews.  I believe his main thesis is
that music has a great influence on the civilization and culture which
creates it.  He analyzes Chinese, Western, and Indian music traditions,
and to some extent pre Greek and Greek music.  There is much material
which is thought provoking, though his conclusions are rather sweeping and
general.  I believe it is unfair to interpret his thoughts as
racially biased, although he is hard on most "modern" Western music,
including jazz and R&R.  Should one dismiss Indian ragas
because they believe Indian culture at one time condones(d) the caste
system and abuse of women?
