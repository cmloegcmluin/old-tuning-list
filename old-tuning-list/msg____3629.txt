I guess that's me.  Robert Rich wrote the original Hypercard stack, 
but I've been doing the recent upgrades.

The PowerMac question has come up before, and I've looked into it.
The short answer is: no.  I don't know how to do it, and I'm not 
sure it can be done.

Adam, I assume you're talking about the internal sound not working. 
I believe all the calculation and MIDI functions still work, 
but let me know if this is not so.

JI Calc had to cheat quite a lot to get the 68K Apple hardware to retune.  
(Thanks to K Romana Machado for writing this code.)  The PowerMacs lack 
the hardware to support these hacks.  All sound calls are now routed 
through Sound Manager 3, which specifies frequencies as 12-TET notes.  
As far as I can tell, there's no way to cheat Sound Manager.  But then, 
I'm not a hardcore hacker, and I don't have a PowerMac to experiment on.

I know that applications like Tom Erbe's PitchFork and James McCartney's
SuperCollider get non-12TET frequencies out of the PowerMac, but 
JI Calc is that relict of an earlier age, a Hypercard stack.  I wrote
some XCMDs in Pascal for it, but I suspect the whole thing would have
to be ported to CodeWarrior to run on the PowerMac, and that surpasses
my abilities and priorities right now.
 
If anyone knows better -- knows a cool way to cheat Sound Manager, or
some other insight to get non-12TET from Hypercard on a PowerMac -- 
please contact me.
