To this I would add:
MR-Rack, MR-61, MR-76 - Rack mount and full keyboard, 1536
parts per octave.  Stores one global RAM                 user tuning that
can be downloaded via MIDI Tuning
Standard dump messages and edited on the fly 
with MTS note change.  Over 40 tunings in ROM.
>ESQ-1, ESQ-M, SQ-80, 
>SQ-1, SQ-1R - Can be retuned to different ET's with a               coarse
but sometimes usable resolution.

See my series in the Transoniq Hacker http://www.transoniq.com/~trnsoniq/
April-June 1995 for details on tuning ALL the Ensoniq synths.  Also see the
web page (www.ensoniq.com) for general specs.
