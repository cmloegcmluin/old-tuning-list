Subject: Re: Off-Subject:  Trills

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Trills before the Romantic period start from the upper note.  After 1820,
it is permissiable to start the trill from the lower "written" note.  This
continues straight through the 20th century, thus including Jazz
tradition.
