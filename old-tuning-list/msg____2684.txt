Subject: RE: composing

From: Mmcky@aol.com

I prefer to use very few chords in my compositions.  Whether this
has anything to do with my predilection for Just Intonation is
unclear.  In most things, I am a minimalist.

I have software that analyzes type 0 MIDI files for the number of
chords they contain, and it appears that most composers use many
more chords than I.  I haven't done a systematic survey, and I
have no great knowledge of classical music, but what exploration
I have done indicates that Bach is the King of Complexity in this
area with many of his compositions having more than a hundred
chords.

Mozart seems to have the greatest tendency toward simplicity in
this area with Beethoven being somewhere in the middle.
