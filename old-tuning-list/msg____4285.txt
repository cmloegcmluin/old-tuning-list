I was struck by the similarity between your hypothetical construction of
the diatonic scale through filling in the gaps in a Major triad and
Schenker's tonal prolongation through the same mechanism. Schenker was not
interested in a scale per se, but rather _tonality_ itself, and his idea is
strictly dependent upon the unfolding of the material (composed into
contrapuntal lines) over time. I assume that your model, is, however, one
of scale construction rather than voice leading, but your short description
seemed to be in the Schenkerian spirit. But then again, I may be reading
too much or too little into what you have written...
