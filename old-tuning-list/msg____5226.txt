This is an excellent example how compartmentalization has been so damaging.
The  ''applied'' music student (presumably in a conservatory and not a
liberal arts institution) reading the notes without any analysis is - to my
ears - not making music as much as someone pushing notes around on a piece
of paper without regard for how they might sound. Too, I would contend that
your ''theory major'' is certainly not studying anything having to do with
music unless the processes of ''actually making (and listening to) music''
are always in consideration. My experience of ''music theory'' in US
undergraduate training is also that the patterns learned are not
''underlying'' but rather superficial surface aspects of existing
repertoire (I mentioned the mechanical extraction of ''schenkergrams'' is
an earlier posting; I fear that the algorithmic approaches not in use will
have similar results),
