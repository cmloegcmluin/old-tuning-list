I am pleased to see that so many verbose tuning list subscribers are
expressing the limitations of xtET and JI tuning systems.
I found the same limitations when I played with them, which is why 
I eventually began looking further into other possibilities.
>From my experience and that of others using LucyTuning during the
past eleven years, the only limitation that we have found, is that
modulating in a circle and arriving back in the original key
[as one can in any (integer)tET system] is "forbidden" in this spiral
system.
You may argue with my interpretation of physics logic, philosophy, 
business practices, arrogance, or "ghostone" ideas; yet if you're 
looking for a practical microtuning system which is flexible, and 
can tackle all or any other tuning; We've already got it sussed!
 
download the tech. specs etc. from
http://www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullaby
 
BTW the site is currently being upgraded and simplified for those 
without SchlockWave etc.
Try it yourself (for old/new/classical/folk/experimental music)
and enjoy!
