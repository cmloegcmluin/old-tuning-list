Ever heard of a scale that divides the double octave into 47 steps? It is non-
octave, naturally, and its equal-tempered version accomodates 7- and 13-limit
intervals exceptionally well. I came across it when playing a little with
"Pythagorean" scale approaches. For those interested I put it up on the Net:
