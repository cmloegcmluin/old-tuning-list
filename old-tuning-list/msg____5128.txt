i hooked a fader to frequency in kyma (the world's most expensive tone
generator?) and played around with the limits of my hearing.  i'm 27, in good
physical shape, and have no hearing conditions that i'm aware of, although i
get hayfever, which tends to congest the whole ears/nose/throat system.  my
hearing seemed to fade out around high 16- to low-17 khz.  the transition from
"i definitely hear a high-pitched tone" to "i maybe sense some sort of sound"
is
fascinating.  i wonder if anybody has played with real-time visual tests of
light frequencies escaping the threshold of perception?
