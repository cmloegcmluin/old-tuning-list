Originally the ancient greek mathematics was entirely based on rationals
and they believed that there were no other numbers.  I read that the
first guy who proved there were irrationals so upset the applecart that
they took him out to sea and drowned him.  The problem was that all
their proofs assumed that only rational numbers existed and so were
completely undermined.  Later, they patched it up and were able to cope
with irrationals.
