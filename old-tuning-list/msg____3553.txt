   True;  *I* said that.  

   I was directing that particular comment not toward you as much as toward
those who have commented over the list that 4:5:6:7 isn't discordant enough to
function as a dissonance.  

   And also, I was not intending my reply to address barbershop Qtet
specifically, but what sounded like an overgeneralization that 4:5:6:7 is
consonant and a sharper seventh makes it dissonant.  

   I have found that to depend heavily upon musical context, so as a
counterexample, I pointed out that 4:5:6:7 functions quite effectively as a
dissonance in the context of an authentic cadence.  I used an authentic cadence
as an example because it is almost certainly the single most common chord
progression involving dominant seventh chords.  

   I may be mistaken here, but I think that authentic cadences aren't terribly
common in barbershop style.
