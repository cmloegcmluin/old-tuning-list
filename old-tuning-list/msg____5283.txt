I don't want to venture a guess in this particular instance (can
you get more details?), but it's been my experience that
"alternate tuning" in guitar-speak generally means "tuned other
than E-A-D-G-B-E".  I've had more than a few disappointments when
digging into an article or net-reference I thought was going to
be about what we've all accepted as "alternate tunings".

Of course, you might take what I say with a grain of salt.  While
I do actually have a couple of guitars around the house (both
either in or becoming 22tet, BTW -- I finally made up my mind :),
I'm really just a bass player in disguise. ;-)
