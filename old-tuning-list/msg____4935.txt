No, there is no single set of dates. I would say Renaissance through Middle 
Baroque. Well-temperaments brought the 16:19:24 tuning into currency in the 
Late Baroque period. Please don't make this into another black-and-white 
issue, I'm trying to explain tendencies, not impose rules. Having played in 
these tunings during the 20th century, I can't give experimental proof that 
my own tendencies in this regard are similar to historical ones indepentenly 
of having grown up bombarded with classical music on the radio (which 
included some authentically-tuned performances of Renaissance music). But I 
feel them strongly.
