Subject: Well temperament, WHEN??

    A non-restrictive tuning was at one time called an Equal temperament, was
it not?

  I strongly believe that the ease of setting has a lot to do with the favor
of a temperament, i.e.,  the easier the system of tuning is, the more likely
it is to be used. 
     To this extent, the Kirnberger should have been popular,  it is rather
easy.  The theorists could easily champion the cause of the mathematical
tuning, (ET), but that does not mean that that was the temperament that was
in general use.

When I quoted Johann Joseph Loehr statement of the early 1800's;
> "There never was a man capable of tuning  by a ear a pianoforte or 
> an organ so as not to leave some inequality of temperament, and 
> there never will be", etc...........

   Let's talk about this "margin".  I would challenge anybody to tune an
equal temperament, on a fortepiano,  using the known tuning procedures of
1800, so even that a sensitive composer could not tell the difference between
keys.  
    It is quite easy to use octaves and fifths to get all the way around the
circle without a "wolf", however, the thirds will give it away as being
unequal, and it is the thirds by which we judge the level of musical tension
in a given key.

Walker goes on to say;

   This one is easy.  When I was first instructed in the process of tuning, (
1972), my tutor pointed out to me that the fifths leading up to the C-E third
could be made a little "noisy" so that the key of C would be the "nicest".
 This was in north Louisiana!!!!!  If the tradition of "key favoritism"  was
still extant 25 years ago,  I really believe that in 1800, the practise was
probably more widespread .  

In response to my statement;

Walker replies;
>>You could make much the same argument for meantone temperaments being
>>impossible in the 15th century, but we have corroborating evidence to
>>show that they did indeed employ such tunings then; 

      Comparing the ease of production between meantone and 12TET seems like
a stretch.  Equal temperament is much more difficult. Meantone (1/4 comma
Aaron) is so easy in comparison, that it's use doesn't mean that everything
else followed as well, i.e.  tempering four fifths at better than 5 cents
each is a lot easier than tuning 12 fifths at 1.95 each.  The scale of
difficulty doesn't translate. 

Walker again;

  Why does this render his other statements useless?  Do we know what he was
talking about inre Db vs.C#?  I don't, and though it seems that from our
point of modern view, there is no difference, was he talking about meantone?
or was he talking about orchestral intonation, or singers?.  But his
pronouncements upon key characteristics are easily understood when listening
to his sonati in Well temperament. 

    What it comes down to when deciding performance practises is listening to
the music, and making decisions.  It is easy to say that composers didn't
write anything down about their preferences, but is that true?  Did they not
write down the notes?  Is music a language or not?  If it is, then can it not
tell us something about the composers intention?  
     Extrapolation of temperament practise from composition is pretty thin
stuff, I know,  but coupled with what documentation we have of the state of
science, (ET is a scientific tuning), and demonstrated differences in the
sound of say, the "Pathetique" performed on Well temperament and Equal
Temperament,  I am convinced that it was not composed with ET in mind.  I
just cannot imagine Beethoven would have been oblivious to, or uncaring about
the lack of tonal contrasts that follow from the use of Equal Temperament.  

Walker again;
>If pianists need their confidence 
>bolstered by foundationless arguments, concerning the tunings 
>Beethoven would have heard, <snip>

      Foundationless arguments?  The way I read and hear it,  there is more
foundation for the use of unequal tuning than there is for ET.
