Subject: tuning software

From: "M. Nail" <mnail@u.washington.edu>

there is a program called Tuning Wrench that supports midi tuning
standard (or whatever it's called, I've forgotten)/ it was written to
work with Turtle Beach cards (but I don't think their Win95 drivers
support it). it's available at Harmony Central, I think.
