In the 17th century the term "musica theoretica" was used to refer to 
philosophical discussions of divisions of the octave (i.e., alternate 
tunings) and their acoustical implications, whereas "musica prattica" 
referred to actual music-making, including everything now called "music 
theory"!  The theoreticians and the practitioners did not seem to pay much 
attention to each other, according to what I have read.

It's nice to see that musica theoretica is alive and well on this list and 
that practicing musicians are using those theories so that we can hear and 
assess them.
