Subject: the Moon

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

So, here's a question I've always wanted to ask some physicist sort, and 
since a lot of the great tuning theorists are exactly that, now's the 
time to ask. Why is it that the Moon always keeps one face turned to us? 
I've long thought that seemed sort of odd. What sort of math is at work, 
on a very basic level, to make that happen, and why? Is that common with 
Moons in general, or is Earth an exception? It seems to me that it makes 
more sense if the two spheres were off a bit, so to speak, and that the 
Moon would gradually show all of it's surface. Any ideas? Maybe things 
like this relate to scales and harmonies as well. Of course, then one can 
think about all of the different things happening with the orbits of the 
planets and stars as well, and what sort of great BALANCE does this 
create, and again all the limitless numbers of frequencies from the 
bazillions of waves pouring through the great expanse of the Universe,
how do they affect us teensy little bodies of flesh and bone as they zip 
ceaselessly through our minds and cells?

Incidentally, I want to congratulate John Schneider for such a great job 
with Microfest in LA on March 8. He pulled together a really diverse 
bunch of folks from the field of alternate tunings, and helped to make it 
a really wonderful event. I was greatful to be invited, and to meet and 
hang with some of the great names in tuning ideas. We got great press in 
the LA Times, and I believe one is coming out in the weekly as well. I 
think we need more of these events, as they seem to be catching on. It's 
not that hard to get a few hundred bucks for airline tickets together, do 
some press work (and so far the press has really dug the ones we've done 
so far...gives them something new to write about), and boom, instant 
Microwhatever. I think it's the best way to make a case to people about 
"Microtones", let them HEAR it, instead of only read about theories in 
books...so, here's to more of 'em...Hstick
