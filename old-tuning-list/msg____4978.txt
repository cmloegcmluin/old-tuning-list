This doesn't address my point: I said that only a pattern of 
inequalities which produces thirds nearer to 5/4 for the "white" keys, 
and nearer to 81/64 for the "black" keys could count as evidence for an 
intentional attempt to tune according to a well-tempered system. What 
your are trying to do is label anything with noticeable differences a 
well-temperament -- anyone can win an argument by redefining terms in 
such a way.

I like the anecdote, but tuning practices in Louisiana during the 1970s 
will hardly serve as historical evidence for tuning practices between 
1750 and 1800 in Germany and Austria. Again, I'll repeat that I have no 
vested interest in the consensus view that ET had become the normal 
keyboard tuning by 1800 in Germany/Austria; indeed I would receive any 
documentary evidence to the contrary with enthusiasm. But I'm still 
waiting ...

Two matters concerning 16th-century tuning practices in reply to this:
Firstly, you picked the easiest meantone to tune; 1/3-comma isn't so 
much harder either, but what of the 2/7 and 2/9-comma temperaments, 
which had some popularity during this period? These certainly aren't 
such a dawdle.
Secondly, if ET was well-nigh impossible in the 18th century,  as you 
argue, how come it was in popular use for lutes and viols during the 
16th century? I mentioned this before, but you didn't address this. I'll 
certainly grant that the differences between keyboard instruments and 
fretted string instruments make it simpler for the latter, but this 
hardly closes the gap on what you are arguing. I'm sure 16th-century 
attempts at ET were not especially accurate, but equality was certainly 
their stated intention.

I can't believe that I haven't made this point perfectly clear by now; 
perhaps you should read what I've said more carefully. Distinguishing 
between the NOTES Db and C# is not the same as distinguishing between 
the KEYS Db major and C# major. But I'm not going to repeat all I've 
said yet again; if you haven't time to read what I've already said on 
this matter, then let's drop it.

Musicians have convinced themselves of all sorts of things by relying on 
"what the music says", or "what their ears tell them". For instance, the 
performance of Renaissance polyphony without sharpened leading-notes at 
cadences was the norm until a few years ago, and prominent ensembles 
such as the Hilliard still sing this way. People convinced themselves 
that this was the characteristic sound of Renaissance modality, that 
flat leading notes were in the music, obvious to anyone who used their 
ears. But it was all utter rubbish, based on a wilful disregard of all 
the sources on ficta practices, and on a misguided fixation with a modal 
purity that had nothing to do with compositional practices of this time. 
You can still find plenty of CDs which bear witness to this nonsense.

The ground strewn with such corpses, so forgive me if I'm disinclined to 
accept any far-reaching thesis purely on the grounds that the ears of 
some (no doubt able) musician have convinced him of its truth. What of 
the converse: would you like to say that anyone whose stomach doesn't 
churn at the sound of Beethoven in ET lacks some essentials of 
musicianship? Was Chopin (advocate of ET, as I've said before) less than 
a true musician?

.. and that says it all.

Again, lest I create the wrong impression, I'll repeat that I am very 
glad to know that Ed Foote is about to succeed in getting some 
well-tempered Beethoven onto CD. Nothing I have said should be construed 
to suggest that there is anything illegitimate in such a venture. But 
categorical statements about historical events require support of a very 
different order from what Ed has offered so far.
