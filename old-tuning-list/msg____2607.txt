I missed the original request made by Brian, but I am interested to know exactly why proper and 
strictly proper modes ("A mode is called proper when all intervals of an interval class are not 
smaller than those of lower interval classes. It is called strictly proper when all intervals of 
an interval class are larger than the ones of lower classes" - Manuel Op de Coul) are considered 
to have more validity, or be more interesting than modes which are not proper?

Is there a theoretical justification for this position?
