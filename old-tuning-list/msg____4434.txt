A friend of mine just bought a Roland XP80, which permits
12-note-per-octave tuning, specified in cents, and possibly per-note tuning
across the whole keyboard as well, althought I'm not as sure about that
part, as I only had a quick look at the manual, and about 5 minutes of
actual playing with the settings.
