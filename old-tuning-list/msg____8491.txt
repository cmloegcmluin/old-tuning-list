Subject: MIDI sequencers & 19-tone eq.temp.

From: "McDougall, Darren Scott - MCDDS001"

To everybody who has sequenced music in 19-tone:

In regards to MIDI note-number allocations, we all know that the defined
standard for 12-TET is middle C = 60.
In a previous post I mentioned that when working in 19-TET, that I have chosen
E above middle C = 64.

Please share with us the allocation that you used in your sequenced music.

Thanks,
DARREN McDOUGALL
