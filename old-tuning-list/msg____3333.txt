Subject: Partch, Johnston, Kronos

From: Brian Belet <BBELET@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu>

I saw Ben's performance of 'Barstow' with Kronos a year ago at Santa Cruz,
California.  While driving Ben from the San Francisco airport to the
concert I asked him about the whole project (and I continued the conversation
in depth while visiting Ben at his home last September).  So:  here's HIS
take on this.

Ben has long championed the integrity of Partch, including Partch's initial
statements regarding the use of his instruments, etc., etc.  Ben has been
using the string quartet as a modern microtonal ensemble for a long time
(he has just finished his 10th quartet); in many ways this ensemble has
been Ben's personal 'invention' in much the same way that Partch's
instruments are.

Ben worked with Partch on the orginal 'Barstow', including performing in
the ensemble.  Ben reports that Partch was NOT always in tune (singing),
and certainly his instruments are not 100% in tune with his theory.  OK:
so much for the sacredness of Partch's original instrumentation, etc.

Partch was a complex individual with more than a few moments of radical
statements.  His insistence on using only his own instruments may be one
of these (my own thoughts....not necessarily Ben's).  At any rate, Partch
stated this longbefore Ben establish the SQ as his own proportionally tuned
ensemble.

Ben's transcriptions of 'Barstow' for SQ & voice is excellent.  He consulted
all of Partch's versions (sketches, etc., etc.), and called upon his
experience working directly with Partch on this project.  Ben's voice is
just right for the performance now (he even looks the part!).  The result
is both true to Partch and to Ben.  It is simultaneously a compliment to a
former teacher/mentor and a strong statement from one our most important
living composers.

It 'works' theoretically (I've studied Ben's score in comparison to Partch's)
and aurally.  The current transcription IS NOT offered as a replacement for
Partch's original work; rather it is a unique offering from his one student
who qualified (technically and aesthetically and personally) to handle such
a project.  (Sure, I could do it on paper, but it would not be 'right' for
me to do it.  I see it as clearly another matter for Ben to do it.)
