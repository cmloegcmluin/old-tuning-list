Subject: Addition to reply to Graham re: Schoenberg

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

I must also mention this:  as a young man,
Schoenberg was a member of "Polyhymnia",
a worker's chorus conducted by Zemlinsky
(whom he also credited as his only teacher).

I'd say that since his earliest experiences as
a musical performer were in string quartets
and choirs, Schoenberg had a good opportunity
to exercise his incredible ear and hear lots and
lots of ratios.

I don't think the piano played as much of a
formative role in Schoenberg's musical development
as it did for most other musicians of his time.
Perhaps *this* is a key (unintended pun) as to
why he developed such radical harmonic ideas.
