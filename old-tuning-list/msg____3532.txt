   Oh, no, not particularly.  I was pointing out that a 4:5:6:7 dominant 7th
chord provides a completely effective authentic cadence, although a 9:5 or 16:9
seventh works better, all in all.  

   Certainly though, that depends a lot on how you're producing that cadence.  I
suspect that, in the form of strummed guitar chords, the smaller stepwise
resolution of the flatter seventh would be less apparent (if even present at
all) than in, say, three-part chorale-like harmony.
