Subject: The Xens have it...

From: Steven Rezsutek <steve@synapse.gsfc.nasa.gov>

Just wanted to share my joy at having finally completed my first
_permanent_ guitar conversion last night -- I now have a completed
electric guitar in 22TET, to go along with my "temporary" acoustic.

The process was pretty easy, and actually rather enjoyable.  Thanks,
Gary, for the helpful tips a while back.  Good and proper tools
certainly do make a difference!!

I messed up three (out of 40) of the slots, two have a "bend" in them,
and a third is slightly misplaced, but rather than try and refill and
recut the slot, I decided to live with it and move on.  I think the
errors are far enough apart that they won't be much of an impedement
to my learning, and this was only a learning experiment to begin with.
Good thing, too, given that I wound up with a couple of hammer dings
in the fingerboard as well. :-)

As for my lesson learned, I think that for my next project, I'll get
an Incra Fence for my table saw and start with a new fingerboard
blank. It's bound to be more accurate than the masking tape and back
saw method, at least in my hands.

Oh, the title referrs to my current stable of pitch producing
instruments now being overwhelmingly non-12.  Out of an upright
bass, 2 electic basses (one fretless), elec. and classical guitar,
hammered dulcimer, shakuhachi and synth, only my fretted bass is
locked into 12.  Actually, I have no intent to change that one --
sometimes pizza and beer is good. ;-) :-)

Now, "all I gotta do" is learn how to _really_ make music with 'em,
but that too shall come to pass.  In fact, our guitar player was over
last week, and he's intrigued enough that he agreed to borrow the
22TET electric and work on it a bit to see what he can come up with.
The Xenharmonic Garage Band is one step closer to reality!!
