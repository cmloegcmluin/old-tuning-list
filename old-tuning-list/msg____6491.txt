Subject: next step in tunings

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

My personal wish is that there is no new tuning to replace
12eq...then, we'll eventually be in the same dead end we're in now. My
dream would be that people are taught the basic principles of what a
tuning system is all about, starting with the importance of the harmonic
series; then, they can decide what tuning system fits their needs. My
friend Dan Stearns is a monster guitarist/composer, who uses 20 eq to
great advantage; Mayumi Reinhard has a beautiful system based around the
13th harmonic and it's sounds; John Schneider uses a 12 tone purely tuned
system, and I know there are many, many more. I can see no reason why any
of these systems should predominate over any other. Each system has
advantages and possible disadvantages...one is not "better" than another.
    I cannot even think that way anymore...I use 19 and 34 eq now, but
plan to try many other systems as time goes by...I am sure that each
different tuning will offer it's own surprises, and will stimulate me to
ever new and intriguing compositional/technical concepts.
    Of course, I also realize that most musicians, even monster players,
will have a hard enough time with even one tuning, much less
many...humans seem to like security, even if it is a false security. So,
in that regard, I can see that calling for a single new system to replace
12 could have supporters. But, I have also found that once one
understands the underlying principles behind what a tuning is in the
first place, switching between them is not such a big deal. I saw a
guitar student at Schneider's masterclass in Denver recently play Bach on
John's purely tuned axe, and it sounded killer. I believe that if I had
axcess to various guitars, refretted to whatever tuning, that I could get
around on them pretty quickly and begin playing real music. Again, it's
the underlying principles of tunings that's the issue, not whether one is
better than the other. In the same vein, I see no inherent superiority
between different styles of music...jazz, flamenco, rock, blues,
whatever...all are languages, which SAY something, and because you can
play one style well, that does NOT necessarily mean that you can play any
other. So, which style is "better" in this case? A great blues musician
is surely the equal of a great flamenco player is the equal of a great
country player, Middle Eastern, and on and on...it's an old arguement,
and one which I resolved in my mind many years ago. I feel the exact same
way about tunings ...a tuning allows some sort of expression, and that's
all it does. To paraphrase an old proverb, the man makes the tuning, the
tuning does not make the man...Hstick
