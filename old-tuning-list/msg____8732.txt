Subject: Re: microtonal conference

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

San Diego or Los Angles, or thereabouts sounds good to me.  The AFMM has
hosted 3 microtonal symposia at New York University.  It seems a good time
to congregate in southern california.  I plan on attending, and with some
outside support, bring the AFMM Ensemble.
