One Year Graduate Research Assistanship Available, Dartmouth College Graduate
Program in Electro-Acoustic Music, Bregman Electro-Acoustic Music Studio. 

For graduate or post-graduate student (at least a B.A, but any level will be
considered) with strong abilities in computer music, mathematics, and excellent
writing skills, to work on a series of educational modules in mathematics and
music and computer music. Some teaching possibilities as well, depending on

(Note to members of this tuning list: Obviously, these modules will include
components on experimental intonation, tuning theory, and computer music
intonation ideas, so please spread the word. It's a nice opportunity for
someone to be in a good environment for a year, get a lot of their own work
done, do an interesting project with me, and get a "modicum" of support (a full
graduate stipend, which is an austere living wage for a single person here --
lp)
