   Uhmmm...  Why 8 pitch tables?  (Well, maybe that's not important.)

   You may be able to use the patch select buttons:  Set up four layers of
the same sound (using copy layer command, being sure to copy on parameters
and not data also), but give each a different pitch table, and then in the
Edit:Instrument page, edit the "00", "*0", "0*", and "**" layers.

   That will work if you don't have to hit pitches from two different pitch
tables at the same time.  If you do, then do you need all 128 notes?  If
not, you can do keyboard splits, and use the octave-range of the notes to
select different subset tunings.
