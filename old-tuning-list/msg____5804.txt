Subject: CPSs with no factor of 1

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Actually, CPSs with no factor of 1 arise naturally in the construction
of Euler genera from CPS building blocks. For example, the Euler genus
3.5.7 can be constructed from the CPSs 1)4[1,3,5,7], 2)4[1,3,5,7], and
3)4[1,3,5,7]. The intersection of the first two is the CPS 1)3[3,5,7],
and the intersection of the last two is 2)3[3,5,7]. So CPSs without a
factor of 1 are "where you put the glue" when constructing Euler genera.
In the triangular lattice, the CPSs are symmetrical structures, while
the Euler genera are skewed parallelopipeds. In fact, according to the
triangular lattice philosophy, there are many other structures just as
simple as Euler genera. For example, if you use 1)3 [1,3,5] and 2)3
[1,3,5] as the connecting faces for the first three CPS mentioned above,
you get such a structure. (The individual CPSs will, in general, have to
be transposed with respect to the raw multiplication results; the fact
that you don't have to transpose them in the construction of the Euler
genus is a mere mathematical curiosity.) More interesting is what
happens when you use all possible connecting faces of a given CPS; at
least in some cases, this results in what Erv Wilson called a
"stellation." Or using all possible 1)n or (n-1))n CPSs connected to a
given point; that results in a Partch diamond if the n factors are
consecutive odd numbers starting with 1. . .
