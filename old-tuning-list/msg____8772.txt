Subject: Comments and a question

>From an alternate tuning neophyte:

I just gave a listen to Igor Darreg's CD (Detwelvulate); this CD has really
opened my eyes (and ears!) The possibilities boggle.
Darreg's talk of the different "feelings" created by the myriad of possible
scales and temperments has me wondering...

My question has to do with the human voice. Is it possible that individuals
who attempt to sing within the constraints of a given scale or temperment,
and find themselves unable to do it, are just singing to a different scale
or temperment that they don't recognize? A kind of "inborn" scale that they
personally "resonate" with.

If there is a possibility that the above query could be answered in the
affirmative - based on some hard research or exploration - could there then
be some way to help people who "sing-out-of-tune" to recognize the scale
they are singing in and thus liberate them to continue singing with
confidence in their own god-given scale?

If it was possible to identify self-generated scales and temperments, and
then teach people how to develop same for their own personal edification
(and anyone else who might want to listen).

If someone has already done this, what are some non-threatening tools that
would help to identify these self generated scales and formalize them in a
way that theycould be reproduced on a computer, synthesizer, etc.

Hope I'm not trying to re-invent the wheel.
