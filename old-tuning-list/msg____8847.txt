Subject: New List Member Introduction

From: "Darren Burgess" <dburgess@acceleration.net>

Greetings,

Darren Burgess here from Gainesville, FL.  I am relatively new to Tuning
and Just Intonation, having been of student of Denny Genovese  since early
this summer.

My interest has primarily been in instrument building and restoration, and
converting intruments to just tuning.

My project is the restoration and retuning of a 1961 Schulmerich Carillon. 
It consists of two sets of bells.  One set consists of 5 octaves of steel
bars with solenoid strikers controlled by a standard mechanical keyboard
(Harp/Celesta Bells).  There is also another complete set of 5 octaves of
"Flemish Bells."  Both are amplified via magnetic pickups and tube
amplifieres through large out door PA speakers.  Following completion of
the restoration, the instrument will be installed in a small bell tower, as
yet to be constructed.

Other features of the instrument include a mechanical roll player complete
with timers and about a dozen paper player piano type rolls.

I am close to completing a draft of the tuning and am hoping that members
of the list will be able to offer feedback about what I have developed. 
The tuning was developed with Quattro Pro 8.0 and I will be converting it
to various formats (html, excel, etc.) and making the files, along with
documentation, available on my website within a week.

If anyone out there is interested in providing feedback, please let me
know.

Thanks!

Darren Burgess
