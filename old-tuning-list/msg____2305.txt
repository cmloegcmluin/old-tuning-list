Subject: Re: The smallest LCM 3-octave, 36 note JI scale.

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I believe that LCM is the usual mathematical abbreviation for "Least Common
Multiple".  Marion and probably others use that as an indicator of the overall
harmonic complexity of a chord.  The lower the LCM, the simpler the chord.  

   For example, the least common multiple of 4, 5, and 6 is 60.  That's the
smallest number that is an even multiple of all three (4x15=5x12=6x10=60).  So
that major triad voicing would be equally complex harmonically as a 10:12:15
minor triad (LCM is also 60), even though its numbers are somewhat higher on the
whole.  

   Some on the list have disputed whether LCM is the best measure of harmonic
complexity.  Personally, it strikes me as a reasonable rule-of-thumb, although I
haven't personally compared it with other possibilities.
