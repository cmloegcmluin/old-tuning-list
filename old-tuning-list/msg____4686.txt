Subject: Miscellany

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Brian McLaren phoned me and said that mail is now being delivered 
properly to his home in Oregon and that he will send out things 
he's promised people earlier. Also, Brian also offered to send some
introductory materials to newcomers to the list if they would write him 
at 2462 S.E. Micah Place, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.

BTW, an excellent introduction to Just Intonation is David Doty's
Just Intonation Primer, available through the Just Intonation
Network. See the web page at http://www.dnai.com:80/~jinetwk/other.html.

Ear-scorcher? It's just the harmonic series from 7 to 14...  The
inversion, Kathleen Schlesinger's diatonic Mixolydian harmonia, sounds
a bit odd, however.
