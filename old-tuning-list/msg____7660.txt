They ARE editors of a GUITAR MAGAZINE. Come on!

Instead of writing an article on theory try this...

Write an article on John Schneider. He's been performing 
the music of this centuries ground breaking microtonal
composers (Lou Harrison, Harrry Partch, La Monte Young)
for a couple of years now, has a few cd's out with plans
for more. Next cd he releases - write an article about
him and his guitars and shop it around. If you get more 
room than a half page, a feature even! - maybe you can 
convince them that you should also write a side bar on
the short history of tuning.

You could even write about Rod Poole, hopefully 
his next cd will come out this year. If GP still doesn't
go for it, try Musician magazine. They seem to be interested
in the educational aspect of magazine content. If it 
goes that far, maybe the article should be written by somebody
else so that Neil Haverstick fellow (who?) can be included
with Jon Catler (that Birdhouse cd should be out this year), 
John Schneider, Dan Stearns and other microtonal guitarists.
At that point - maybe, if it gets that far - Johnny
Reinhard or John Chalmers or some aspiring theorist
could write the side bar or even a full separate article.

Don't forget to include URLs like: 1/1, Starrett's Tuning Links page,
The main Partch site - Corpreal Meadows, 
the La Monte site - MELA Foundation,
info about joining the list.

I know a bit about the magazine biz: I'm in it.

 "Now stop it. You've proved your point."

        Guitar World/Maximum Guitar editor
        after I showed him how to tune a guitar 
        to upper harmonics.

You're way too fragile for the net Neil! 

Maybe it would make you happy if you knew that 
I finished writing this whole letter and Netscape 
made my computer crash - I had to start all over.

And some other things...

If you (that means anyone reading this!) catch a microtonal
concert in your neighborhood, maybe you can sit down at
the computer and wack out an in depth review for us?
There was a concert in Southern California last month
and it was hardly mentioned. Neil Haverstick (aka Hstick,
HHH, Aline Surman, any more?) has to review his own concerts. Sheesh!
If 100 people came: not one of them is on this list and 
they can't write a review???

Before I step down off of my soap box...don't forget:
AFMM, this Thursday & Friday, Columbia U., 
Saint Paul's Chapel NY, NY 8pm. 

Be there or be out of town.    ;)
