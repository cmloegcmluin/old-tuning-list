I remember him talking about this in other interviews so I don't
think he's joking. Besides: all that wammy bar work is quite 
microtonal and he has a distinct style of bending the strings.
There seems to be a target ratio he aims for.

So he was thinking microtonal long before he got the guitars
specially refretted.

I like his earlier work better. The later work has too much dsp.
Lush - yes but I'm a big fan of great guitar tone = power amp
distortion!
