Subject: Crying "wolf".

   (And, as you very appropriately pointed out, different sources of tuning
errors.)  

   I tend to use "wolf" to mean either of two meanings:  A note that is
conceptually correct in the tuning system but nevertheless has a systematic
pitch error from whatever source, and also the more specific case of the
break in the circle of fifths to make a diminished sixth.  

   I don't know whether to think that it's a good idea to use the same term
for those two meanings, but this sort of general/specific dual word usage
is certainly not unprecedented.  For example:
Equal temperament:
   General:  A tuning based on single, consistent step size.
   Specific: 12TET
Meantone:
   General:  A tuning based up on circle of a fixed size P5 wrapping within
an
             octave.
   Specific: Quarter-comma meantone.
Comma:
   General:  A pitch error between two systematically valid formulations of

             what are conceptually the same pitch.
   Specific: Syntonic comma.

   I suppose one could take either of two camps in this question:
1.  Music is not, and perhaps shouldn't become, an exact science.  This
sort 
    of dual-meaning word is common, and it is poetic license, if not poetic

    justice, that it should be accepted in the case of "wolf" as well.
2.  Look, let's not make the same mistake for the ... what? ... sixth
time?!

   Dan Wolf was, I think, insightful to point out that historically, "wolf"
has been used to describe far more divergent effects, like a note on an
instrument that, just by the acoustomechanics of the instrument itself,
tends to "stick out".  I've even heard some violinists describe the open E
string on a "wolf".  

   So, the clear lesson here is that context is key.
