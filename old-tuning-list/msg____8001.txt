This is the kind of information that companies try to keep from their
competitors.  Julian Colbeck lists sales figures for most popular models in
the Keyfax Omnibus Edition.  The TG33 obviously did not make the grade. 
Since the more common TX802 had sales of 5000 units, I'd expect 1000-2000
for the TG33.  I have seen TG33s for sale on the used market, so they're
out there. Generally modules sell less units than keyboards with the
exception of the Roland Sound Canvas series.

A better source for current information is Music and Sound Retailer, though
they don't give exact numbers.  The best selling series in recent history
has been the Roland XP-50 and its derivatives.  This can be an important
consideration when looking for an instrument that will be well supported
with third party sounds, editor/librarians, etc.
