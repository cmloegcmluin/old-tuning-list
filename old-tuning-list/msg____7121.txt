Subject: Milton Babbitt Symposium

From: Stephen Soderberg <ssod@loc.gov>

I'd like to extend an invitation to all of you tuners to attend a
symposium in honor of Milton Babbitt to be held at the Library of Congress
on Saturday, May 2.  It's not likely that there will be much heated
discussion of 12TET vs 22TET, but I think most of you will find some
interesting papers relating to Mr. Babbitt's work, remembering that he was
one of the pioneers in electronic music.  Please drop me a line if you
plan to attend.  I hope to see you on May 2!

==========================================================================

		****  MILTON BABBITT SYMPOSIUM ****

On Saturday, May 2, 1998 the Music Division of the Library of Congress
will be sponsoring a symposium in honor of Milton Babbitt.  Mr. Babbitt is
donating his papers to the Library, and this symposium is being planned to
celebrate that gift as well as his close association with the Music
Division for the past 30 years.

The symposium will be held in the Coolidge Auditorium where several of Mr.
Babbitt's works have been premiered.  The Auditorium is located in the
Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress across from the Capitol
Building in Washington, DC.  Since the symposium is being underwritten by
a grant from the Krasnoff Gift Fund, there will be no attendance fee.

attend (contact information below).  We would like to know as soon as
possible how many participants to plan for.


		****  TRAVEL AND ACCOMODATIONS  ****
