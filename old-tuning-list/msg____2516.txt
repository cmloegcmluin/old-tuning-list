Subject: guitar tuning

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

About Erik's query on guitar open tunings:

I recently wrote a piece using elecric guitar tuned in a nearly-just 
fashion.  The open strings were not-quite a G chord:

I:   D     3/2
II:  G     1/1
III: C     4/3
IV:  F7+   7/4
V:   B     5/4
VI:  C7+   21/16

By accepting that 12TET fifths are pretty good, I could fret whole tones 
(never semitones), fourths and fifths to get good vertical 
sonorities in the 7-limit.  I kept modulations within these same rules, 
but I guess that you don't have to do that depending on how critical your 
ear and attitude is.

The VI string is nice, because it allowed modulation to the key of "7", 
although only "open" chords without thirds.  It also made for great 
voice-leading down to the V string, straight across the neck.

If you're interested, I'll send you a fretting chart for the whole neck.
