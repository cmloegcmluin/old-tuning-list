   Then again, there's a lot of low-budget "shorts" out there, often by
University film students.  They're often looking for a cost break, which
can sometimes take the form of hiring an amateur film composer with a "real
job", and who will therefore compose for free.

   Now those sorts of movies in themselves won't get much audience, and
thus not much listening to microtonality.  Buuuuut, one of the best ways to
write for big films is to prove - and IMprove - yourself on small films.
