Subject: Reply to Johnny Reinhardt, microtonal clarinet

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Johnny: I didn't mean to give the impression that I was deliberately
not citing Pitch 1:4 (or other issues, all of which are back in Houston
and out of sight, etc.). I came across Richards's dissertation quite by 
chance and thought I'd bring it to everyone's attention, though I suspected
that you might already know of it or of him.
	 BTW, Richards is at Hamilton College in Clinton, NY and has 
been very active publishing and performing. One of his colleagues 
forwarded my post to him and he emailed me with some information about his
books on microtonal performance. Needless to say, I have invited him to 
join the Tuning list. I also mentioned you and the AFMM series.
