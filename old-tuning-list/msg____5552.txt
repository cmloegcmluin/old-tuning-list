   These are the proverbial "church modes" used in Gregorian chant and more
recently in some forms of jazz, blues, and even a little in some popular
music.  They are the scales you get when you between a given pitch and the
pitch an octave higher, but using only the white keys.

   The scale from C to C using only white keys gives us the familiar
"major" scale, which is also called the "Ionian" mode.  A to A using only
white keys gives you what we now call the "natural minor" mode, which is
also called the "Aolean" mode.

   All told, these modes are called:

CDEFGABC Ionian mode (AKA major scale)
DEFGABCD Dorian mode
EFGABCDE Phrygian mode
FGABCDEF Lydian mode
GABCDEFG Mixolydian mode
ABCDEFGA Aolean mode (AKA natural minor)
BCDEFGAB Locrian mode

   These modes also have a set of older Greek names, but I confess that I
don't know those names.
