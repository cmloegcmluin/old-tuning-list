Subject: Re: pure or just

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I believe the use of "just" is reference to honest as being explicit to
nature's overtone series.  It is first used by Thomas Morley in his
treatise on music _A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke_
(1597), the first of its kind.  

Incidentally, the introduction of just intervals into the Mediterranean
appears to stem from England.  John Dunstable is credited with being the
inspiration for Dutch speakers Dufay and Binchois to travel south and
share their "just" wares (c.1450).  The Dutch speaker Tinctoris tried to
explain the new developments by largely dismissing all that had came
before it, and, ironically, by attempting to fit the new consonances into
dated Pythagorean theory.  

There is a selection in Strunk regarding the Northumberland area of
England (c.1200) where it was witnessed that there was an independent part
sung by each singer singing.  Ther further north one went, the more
indepenedent part sung.  This would seem to foretell the Renaissance
interest in vertical listening.

Happy New Year everyone!
