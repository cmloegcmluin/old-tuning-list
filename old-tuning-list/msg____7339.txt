Reuben: To answer Gary's question, no. I do list a large number
of ancient and medieval scales and tetrachords, but nothing
specifically Judaic or Eastern European, except for a few Greek 
Orthodox (aka Byzantine) liturgical and Turkish tetrachords.

 You should get SCALA, Manuel Op de Coul's tuning archive, generator, 
and editor program, available via ftp from ella.mills.edu. It contains 
many examples of Turkish, Indian, Iranian, and other non-12-tet tunings. 
Scala runs on WinTel machines.
There is also JiCalc in for the Mac,  and while less ambitious, it also
contains some of these kinds of scales in HyperCard format. Get the 
3 or 4 stack JiCalc archives along with the program from ella.mills.edu.
