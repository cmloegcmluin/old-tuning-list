Went to www.analog.com.  Could not find an "Extended Csound" card.
Everything there seems to be for developers.  In fact, they make the SHARC
chips in CreamWare's SCOPE card, which I would know where to buy even if I
had $7 K.

I am looking at Yamaha's SW1000XG, but I can't find where to buy that
either.  Has anyone heard of this card?
