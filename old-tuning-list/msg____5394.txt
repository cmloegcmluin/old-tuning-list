Subject: RE: Why ET-x?

From: Mckyyy@aol.com

Hello David,

It puzzles me too, but I have had some time to think about it, so
I have formed some theories.

I think the major reason for the emphasis on ET, and various
other 'transcendental' type scales is that they are easier.  The
math needed to have a state-of-the-art understanding of JI scales
is quite thorny, IMHO, requiring actual thought, rather than just
punching numbers into a calculator or spreadsheet.

There are only a quite limited number of ET scales compared to
the number of JI scales, which is another reason it requires much
less effort to 'master' ET than JI.

Also there is the perception that transcendental math is 'higher'
than grubby old arithmetic.  Arithmetic is taught in the first
grade, but logarithms are only taught later.  Needless to say, I
disagree with this perception.

>Finally, technology is giving us keyboards with virtually
>continuous pitch possibilities, ...

That is what the manufacturer's of these keyboards would like you
to think, but actually, the pitch possibilities are far from
continuous.  The granularity is quite coarse, both from the
perspective of the relative pitch perception capabilities of the
ear, and from the perspective of what is possible to modern
technology.

Those of you who are long time readers of this list will
recognize that I'm back after a long absence.  

Hello again, everyone.
