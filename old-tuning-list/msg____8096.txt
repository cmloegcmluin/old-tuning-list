This site is excellent and also describes many other important early
music tunings. Everyone should read it. I must now correct myself in TD
1367, where I wrote,

>the tuning of Grammateus, where the white keys are in meantone, and the
black keys divide the whole tones >exactly in half.

The white keys are actually in Pythagorean tuning. The resulting tuning
has 10 large and 2 small semitones, like the 12-out-of-22 tuning I
described.
