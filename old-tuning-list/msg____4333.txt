Subject: alternate tuning for the Korg O5R/W

From: malkin@iwaynet.net (David Malkin)

I've got a very specific question that only someone familiar with
microtonality would understand (and hopefully appreciate). I have a Korg
O5R/W syth module that hooks into an old DW-6000 synth. The O5R/W allows
for microtonality, but it only allows you to alter the 12 chromatic steps
of Western harmony (and automatically tunes every octave of the keyboard to
the specs that one specifies). If you want to tune a synth keyboard for
more than 12 steps you are out of luck. I read a book by Scott R. Wilkinson
called TUNING IN. He made reference to an article by Carter Scholz that
appeared in 2/86 copy of KEYBOARD magazine; page 49. He showed how one get
any keyboard to play in microtones by writing a program in Pascal and
having it interface with a Roland MPU@1 and a Yamaha DX7. The computer
waits in an infinite loop in a standby mode and whenever one presses a key
on the keyboard, it triggers the correct pitch bend midi data that is
written in the program.  Is this possible with my Korg O5R/W? Do you know
of anyone who may be of help.
