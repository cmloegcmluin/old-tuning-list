Wow, an International Festival of Microtonal Music...never heard of it
before.  Thanks, John, for bringing this to the List's attention.  Anybody
else out there with some information?

Re: Mayumi's Harmonic 13 tuning - all the notes used by Mayumi were chosen
from Partch's 13-limit Appendix I in Genesis of a Music.  I told her about
Paul's question and she's formulating a response.

Also - thanks to Mark Rankin for letting me in on some remaindered books
by Owen Jorgensen called _Tuning_ (just under 800 pages).  Call
Mockingbird Books at 408-689-9113 for any additional copies they may have
(at slashed prices).  It's basically a How-To-Tune compendium with much
new information about tuners behind the scenes over the last couple of
centuries.
