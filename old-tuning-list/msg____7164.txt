From: mfh2@cornell.edu (martin hatch)

I recently enrolled in the tuning digest list. I'm interested in describing
the parameters of tuning that operate in solo unaccompanied singing. A
number of years ago, I looked at this in the songs of several women singers
from central Java, Indonesia.  Now I'm looking at unaccompanied solo song
in various styles of euro-american-world music.  Can anyone direct me to a
publication that gives a table of the cent values that operate in a
just-tuned scale, in comparison, say, to other scales?  I have the
marvelous table called "Microtonal Music," which was "coordinated by Tui
St. George Tucker, Robert Jurgrau, and Johnny Reinhard," that appeared on
cover of Ear Magazine East 7/5 (11-1/1982-83).  Have there been any
critiques of this table, or has it been superceded?
Thanks,  M Hatch
