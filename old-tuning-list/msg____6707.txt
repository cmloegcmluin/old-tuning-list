Very cool & very perceptive terminology!  This is another example where
the academic world (those who traditionally write the books that create
the next wave of perceived "truth") needs to listen to the music makers
(those who actually make it all happen).  Luckily, more and more, and
esp. in this area, many of us cover both worlds.

Exceptional!  I repeat my belief that steel guitar players are among the
highest level of performers, and sadly much overlooked by the world outside
of country.   In terms of sheer manual technique, I bow to the steel
player any day!  As a string player (bass, viola) I can move both hands
at the same time, and more or less dress myself each morning.  But I
can't even come close to the physical focus & control of a top-notch steel
player......   Then, the tuning possibilities:  multiple necks (diff. tuning
worlds to start with), many strings per neck, steel slide + knee portamento:
WOW!  that's an instrument for us to all consider!!!!!!!!!!!!
