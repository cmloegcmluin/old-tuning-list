Subject: Doty request?

From: A440A@aol.com

Greetings all, 

I have been asked the following question here lately, and can't answer it in
time, perhaps someone here knows 

" There must be a book out by a Mr. Doty called something like "Just
Intonation Primer". Do you know the exact title of the book and the full name
of the author, plus eventually the publisher and the year it was published."

If anybody here knows this book, I would appreciate hearing from you. 

And where is B. Mclaren??   He was writing some of the most interesting stuff
here on this list.  Does he know that?? 

Regards,
