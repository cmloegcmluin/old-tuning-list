Thank you, Graham, for the nice proof of my conjecture, that aside from
the otonal and utonal 7-limit tetrads, and subsets thereof, there are no
chords with only 7-limit intervals. Thank you also for explaining why
things go astray in the >7 limit case. Now, can we come up with a
complete enumeration of "saturated" chords; i.e., chords which consist
only of n-limit intervals but cannot retain this property if any note is
added to them? For the 5-limit, the major and minor triads are the only
examples. 7-limit, it's just the two tetrads. For the 9-limit, the
otonal and utonal pentads work, as well the two 6th chords discussed in
this thread, so there are at least 4 saturated 9-limit chords. A
complete enumeration through the 11-limit, at least, should be of great
interest to users of Partch-type JI.
