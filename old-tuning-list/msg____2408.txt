Subject: Transfinite systems Nugget or Gold Brick
---
Having obtained a used Mattel Power Glove from
one of the members of this tuning forum, I
recently learned that the company which makes
the widget that goes twixt the Power Glove
and the Mac ADB port has changed its address.
Called the number for Transfinite Systems.
Someone answered.  Not Transfinite Systems.
Didn't know what had happened to the company.
Folks, it shouldn't be this goddamn hard.  You
try and you try and you try, and the net result
is: zero.
Does anyone out there have a new address or
phone number for Transfinite Systems?
Does anyone out there have a lead on a Gold Brick
or a Nugget interface box?
