Subject: Three views on the fourth

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Without any number crunching, my spacing model - which was a result of
compositional, rather than analytic thinking - has used a **compacting**
function, where successions of chords **resolve**  by seeking optimal
density.

For example, of the three chords 6/4, 5/3, 4/2 over a given tonic, the
first is not dense enough, the third is too dense, and the middle is just
right. Thus either the first or third chord will **resolve** to the second.
This function does vary with register (I have assumed with critical band
width), but in apparently all voicings available in the conventional vocal
ranges, the example works as given.

I have marked **resolve** with quotes, because this is clearly a local,
cultural feature. In my own work, something like **optimize spacing** might
be more correct, but I am not hung up on terminology.
