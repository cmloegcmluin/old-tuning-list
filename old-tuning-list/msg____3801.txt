Subject: Kraig Grady concert

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I just received a flyer from "the North American Embassy of Anaphoria 
Island" announcing "the only L.A. Performance of TEN BLACK EYE, A Modern 
Anaphorian Shadow Play assembled and performed by Kraig Grady, Roger 
Mexico, B. Ed. Smith, Yelena Tokman. Music performed on the unique 
musical instruments of Kraig Grady.  Stella Adler Theatre, 6773 
Hollywood Blvd, Sun Oct. 27, 8:00 PM, free Admission."

Grady  works with Ervin Wilson and tunes his mixture of acoustic and 
electronic instruments to CPS and other non-12 scales. Don't miss this 
performance if you are in the LA area. 

The postal address of the North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island is
2645 Crestmoore Pl. LA. CA 90056. Kraig has also recently released
a CD of Anaphorian music.
