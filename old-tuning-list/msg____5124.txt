That's interesting. I think our traditional "counterpoint" courses get too
carried away with linear melodic connections as the primary structure,
ignoring harmony. Seriously, I think that one of traditional music theory's
biggest mistakes is to teach that, for European music from at least the
16th to 19th centuries, it is possible to separate the "linear" from the
"vertical" and judge their relative "importance" separately. A parallel
development of theory and pedagogy in the two areas led to the odd state of
affairs where we now have separate "harmony" and "counterpoint" classes.

Certainly the augmented sixth chords developed through linear processes, as
did sevenths, but the fact that they have an effect on the listener as
sonorities as well cannot be denied. (Schoenberg took this reasoning even
further, saying, "Non-harmonic tones form chords, hence they are not
non-harmonic; the musical phenomena they help to create are harmonies, as
is everything that sounds simultaneously.")

There are plenty of possible "interim" chords formed by voice leadings, but
only certain ones found a common place in common-practice theory. It seems
to me that the use of the German augmented sixth as a pivot chord,
equalling the dominant seventh in another key shows that, for the
classical/romantic composers who used this technique at least, the German
augmented sixth was no less a "passing" sonority than a dominant seventh.

I have always scratched my head over those who claim that, because Bach
used polyphony more commonly and prominently than Beethoven, he was a more
"linear" composer. It suggests that Beethoven didn't care about voice
leading or Bach about harmony, which is ridiculous. All of Bach's
counterpoint results in beautiful triadic harmony, and Beethoven was just
as careful as his predecessor about parallel fifths and proper resolutions
and so on. In this style of music, harmony and counterpoint are part of the
same fabric.

Now, I'm not trying to put all of these arguments into the mouth of Dr.
Belet, but he brought up an interesting topic that is important for tuning
and composition as well. I sympathize with his impatience with traditional
"music systems" instruction and its often one-dimensional perspective.
