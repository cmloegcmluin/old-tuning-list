Daniel,
	    Fourier proved that any periodic waveform can be expressed as the sum 
of sine waves whose frequencies form an EXACT harmonic series. A brass 
instrument is crafted so that its RESONANCES approximate a harmonic series, 
but this relationship is not exact (a lot of further misconceptions surround 
brass instrument physics). However, when playing a single note, the 
resonances are DRIVEN by the lips of the player, which normally produce a 
periodic waveform during the "sustained" part of the note. Therefore, an 
EXACT harmonic series is available to drive the resonances of the 
instrument. The closer these resonances are to harmonic, the more the 

overtones will be amplified -- this is the principle behind successful brass 
instrument design.
Likewise, the human vocal cords, when employed in a steady, sustained 
manner, produce a periodic waveform (though recently I have been able to 
DOUBLE or occasionally TRIPLE the period of this waveform and sing an octave 
or twelfth lower than would be normal -- undertone singing! I can then 
emphasize different overtones of these really low notes for an amateur 
version of throat singing). Overtone singing is just the process of shifting 
the resonance to one or another of the harmonic overtones -- again, an exact 
harmonic series results (of course, no one can maintain the pitch of the 
fundamental perfectly, but that is a separate issue). Inharmonic series are 
possible in large, essentially infinite-element vibrating systems like a 
piano string, but brass and wind instruments and human voices are 
essentially elaborate amplification devices for a single-element periodic 
oscillator.

In light of the above, this doesn't really make sense.

Daniel, do you agree with LaMonte and if so, how do you justify doing JI 
with beatless pure tones without invoking combination tones?
