Yes, it is, and it requires other notes to support either the 7/5 or the
10/7 interpretation. The mechanism for supporting ratios is the root in
the otonal case and the common overtones in the utonal case. I don't
claim that there is any similarity between these two mechanisms.

Yes, unless the conditions are sufficient for hearing the 11-limit,
which may be rather often. But the simplest interval between the 9/8 and
the 10/9 is the 19/17 and conditions are rarely sufficient for hearing
the 19-limit.

How so?
Think about triads in 12-equal. Even though all the intervals in the
augmented triad can function as consonances in major and minor triads,
the augmented triad is dissonant. And the thirds aren't even close to
any simple ratios other than the 5-limit ones. Can you say that all
three intervals in an augmented triad are functioning as 5-limit
consonances?

>support 10/9???

They don't support either. They support 28/25, which is too complex to
be psychoacoustically relevant.
