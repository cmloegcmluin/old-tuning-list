Subject: Re: quater tone piano concert

From: sound@musicworks.web.net (Gayle Young)

Hello, I thought you'd all be interested in knowing about a concert
tomorrow (Thursday Oct 3) at the Music Gallery in Toronto:

Gertrude Schneider and Tomas B=E4chly will perform on two pianos tuned a
quarter tone apart.

They will be playing works by:

Charles Ives - Three Pieces for Quarter Tone Piano
Ivan Wyschnegradsky - Integrations
James Tenney - Flocking
as well as pieces by Roland Moser, Martin Wehrli and Virgil Moorfield, but
I don't have titles for these.

The Music Gallery is at 179 Richmond St West, near a central subway stop at
Queen and University. Call 416-204-1080 for more information.  - Gayle
