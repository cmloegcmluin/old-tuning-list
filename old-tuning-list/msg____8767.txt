Hey, all you aficionados of 19-equal guitar:

I've put up on the Sonic Arts website a diagram
of the tones available on this guitar, with
power-of-2 ratios and Semitone values.

We have a couple of Ivor Darreg's 19-equal guitars
here, and we've been improvising on them lately.

We also have Ivor's 17-, 22-, 24-, and 31-equal
guitars, and I'll be adding those to the webpage
in short order.
