Would it not be possible to distinguish each pitchbend-class by
channel number directly? Thus making N tracks in the sequencer, assign
a different channel number to each of them, play the piece through N
times, then merge the tracks to one block. That way the velocity value
won't have to be sacrificed and the program doesn't have to do much, namely
only putting the pitch bend commands at the beginning of the MIDI file.
Well I realise that this comes down to telling the program which note
represents which by hand.
Alternatively, using a keyboard with program-change buttons you could
press one before each note and let the program translate the program
change commands to channel numbers. That way you can enter everything
more conveniently all tracks at once, or track by track.
