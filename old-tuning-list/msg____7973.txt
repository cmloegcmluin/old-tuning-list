You mean you can't just sick the sequencer/controller onto the FB-01 ? 
How about having some kind of MIDI processing between the note-ons/offs 
and the synth appending the sysex commands to them ?
Would this be possible ?

Hmm does this mean that I wouldn't have to perform the previusly 
mentioned contortions ?
I would be able to just send note-on & note-off messages from a  
sequencer/controller ?

but it's not cheap ;-)

Do the words *short on cash* hold any special meaning for you ?
And,like I said I've also got Finale & a MIDI guitar convertor on my 
shopping list.
I figure I can get a more respectable synth later.

Also, I'm in Goa,India and I have to deal with other matters like 
shipping costs,ridiculous import duties,a constantly sinking 
currency,absurd bureaucracy,even more absurd bureaucrats,etc.

Then again, this FB-01 thing looks ike more trouble than it's worth.

Bye,
Drew
