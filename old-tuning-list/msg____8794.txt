Subject: Re: pitch constellations

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Ben Hume has recently built a replica of the Sumerian Aulos which is built
on just intonation relationships -- not 3-limit of the _later_
Babylonians.  And the enharmonic genus of the Greeks was discussed in the
litereature as more anicient than the upstart chromatic and diatonic
genus.  Chicken or the egg?

Tidbit: microtonal composer Stephen Mayer told me years ago that it was
his deaf brother (a medical doctor) that got him singing microtonally.  An
apparently idionsyncratic relationship of pitch fed into the imagination
of a perfect pitch microtonal composer (who mainly uses quartertones).

Elodie Lauton's work (just reviewed by David) was based on her hearing an
inner "chord" which she made manifest in the drone basis of the work.  Too
bad the Knitting Factory is so sloppy with their part of the concert
(late sound check, inaequate microphones, sound pops, noises in
general...ouch).  Awfully hard to be meditative with that kind of
inteference.  The tuning was based on a transposed Pythagorean.
