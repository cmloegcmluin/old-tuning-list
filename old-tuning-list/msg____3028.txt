Subject: A challenge for list members

From: Jeff Welty <jwelty@wdni.com>

Hello all,

I've been on this list now about 8 months and have found it very 
enlightening.  I must admit, though, when the discussion gets too 
technical about ratios of super-rational numbers etc, at times my eyes 
glaze over -- which, of course, is not to say that these aren't important 
discussions.  What I find myself struggling with, is that for someone 
like myself, a technical discussion may have some intellectual meaning to 
my brain, but what are my ears going to hear as the product of the 
discussion?

Sooo, I've been thinking -- I'd really really like to have a library, a 
web page or something where I could go and get a synopsis of a technical 
idea, theory, argument and some actual sound, or MIDI files that would 
demonstrate the idea so my intellect and ears can be "singing from the 
same songsheet", if you know what I mean.

Then I got to thinking in a similar vein, it'd also be very nice to have 
a library of music that could take one from traditional 12 tone equal 
step tuning, to a variety of alternate tunings, but instead of making the 
jump to *extreme* variation from TET, there would be a progression of 
individual songs that would allow ones ears to get accustomed to the 
final desired tunings in a series of steps.  It's very akin to the first 
time I ever had a beer, I really didn't think it was all that great, but 
after a while I did develop a taste for light beers, but wasn't all that 
crazy about darker brews, but over the years, I generally wouldn't touch 
a light beer anymore, because I have come to a point where I much prefer 
the full bodied flavor of a dark brew.

So, list members, what I'm asking I suppose, is to have my ears slowly 
seduced into enjoying alternate tunings the way my taste buds were 
seduced into drinking a dark beer!

Positive steps are regularly posted in this direction, I will point out, 
in annoucements of concerts, or reviews of CDs. It would also be nice to 
know if the piece of music was going to sound totally bizarre and 
unpalatable if you were expecting something close to TET.  I suppose some 
sort of rating might be nice that would let you know based on someone 
else's subjective sense how "out there" a piece is from TET.

I must admit I don't have the time, experience or resources necessary to
build either one of these libraries I spoke of, but I did want to make it
known from my point of view these kinds of libraries would be extremely
useful.

Jeff
