Microtonal guitarist
Jon Catler has had a few groups that might fit that description.

The most recent:
The Catler Bros "Crash Landing" - instrumental jazz rock with 
a early '70's - late '60's feel.
And his band Birdhouse (guitar, vocals, percussion & flute)
is a mix of different styles from blues and rock to art song.

I mention these because the melodies are so hooky - so memorable.
