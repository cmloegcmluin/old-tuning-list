Gary: Yes, I was taking these chords out of musical context. Even a triad 
can be a dissonance when the prevailing harmonic texture is dyadic, as in 
Medieval music which is based on the "perfect" consonances. I was trying to 
use naive, conservatory definitions of consonance and dissonance to keep the 
discussion brief. In jazz, the seventh chord is consonant, especially in the 
mixolydian mode, where the "dominant" seventh is the tonic. Resolutions are 
easy to create, but finding appropriate ones within a coherent pitch system 
is more difficult and very important. Too many different pitches without 
simple relationships and within too short a period of time, and music 
becomes unlistenable to my ears. Unless we're talking about sliding pitches 
motivically used or something like that.

You wrote,

satisfying resolution to my ears, and many others'.

The first sentence here seems to contradict everything else you're saying. 
Do you want to modify this statement?


Ed: I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with, but I'll guess. I'll grant 
you that in barbershop singing, all chords are tuned as justly as possible. 
I will also grant you that a skillful vocal quartet can reduce the perceived 
difference between a 16/9 and a 7/4 by sliding, subtly shifting the 1/1, 
etc. The difference between a 10/9 and a 9/8 may be imperceptible 
melodically (one does not notice that two D's are used in the progression 
C-F-Dm-G-C), but the difference between 16/9 and 7/4 (in the progression 
C-F-G7-C) is noticeable and requires other means to cover it up. To my ears, 
anyway. Try playing Mozart with dominant sevenths tuned 4:5:6:7, and you'll 
get some angry scowls from the audience.


Pat: More recent studies than Helmholtz have found that although violinists 
prefer sharpened major thirds and major sixths, which was thought to be due 
to a preference towards Pythagorean intonation, they also prefer sharpened 
minor thirds, fouths, and fifths, so the preference seems to be towards 
larger intervals in general. All of these studies, by the way, are concerned 
with these intervals in a melodic, not harmonic, context.


Brian: Your assertion that 99+% of psychoacoustic research supports the 
conclusion that the fifth perceived as most pure is larger than 702 cents, 
is ridiculous, unless you meant to add, "in a melodic context." 
Harmonically, there is nothing which distinguishes a 709 cent fifth (with 
which I am very familiar) from a 702 cent fifth, except that the latter does 
not beat. If the lack of beating is not a criteria for "purity," then I 
can't imagine what is.
