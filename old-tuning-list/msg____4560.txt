Subject: Re: harmonicity of partials

From: bil@ccrma.Stanford.EDU (Bill Schottstaedt)

I got inspired by the recent discussion to digitize several
1 minute takes of me playing the smoothest, non-vibrato
notes I could on my cello, then run 1-megaword FFTs over the
data, getting around .02 to .05 Hz resolution (unless
I messed up the arithmetic...) in the fft bins, and within
that resolution I couldn't see any inharmonicity that
was consistent (that is, some partials were a tiny bit
high, others low, others right on).  The actual multiplier
overall was .9999875.  I got similar results from a
harpsichord, but didn't have time to try recording
a low piano note (we seem to have lost our copy of
the McGill CD's, so I couldn't just grab that data).
(I used a spline interpolation kludge to find the "true"
peak, given the surrounding bins).
