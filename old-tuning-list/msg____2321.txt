Okay, I got the glimpse, and I'm completely excited.

But I'm missing a few pieces.  Can someone help?

The 12 tone equal temperament scale is derived from the overtone
series of a vibrating string.  Unfortunately for me, my only reference
on the derivation is Hindemith's Craft Of Musical Composition.  If any
of you have read his work, you'll all groan with me.  It's not helpful.
Apparently, this scale is generate by using 6 overtones, and then a few
approximations, which is where I get lost.  I'd be very interested in hearing
someone concisely construct the scale in this forum.

I think this will help me attempt to construct other scales from other
vibrational modes, i.e., a cylinder, a rod, a sphere, etc.  (a friend pointed
out that a cylinder would have two fundamentals...any comments on that?)

Thanks all.  I loooove this list.
