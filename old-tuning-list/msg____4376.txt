Bruce,

If no one on the list has, then I suppose I can provide some info.
About one year ago Gary and I were working together on this, me
sending him midi files and him telling me how they worked. It took
quite a lot of them until everything was right. Gary used the ASR-10,
which has the same dump format as the EPS. However the ASR sometimes
sends back a NAK (negative acknowledgement) message even if the
retuning went allright. This problem is known to Ensoniq and the NAK's
can be ignored. Steve Curtin told me that the EPS does not do this. 
So I don't know anyone who actually used it with the EPS, but I'm pretty
convinced that it works. And if there remains a problem, I can always
make it work, provided you are willing to receive uuencoded midi-files
from me for trial.
