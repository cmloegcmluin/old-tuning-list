Thanks; I just read it.  My conclusion: it's O.K. to tune your harpsichord
in equal temperament, after all.  (If I'm playing someone other than Bach,
the other composer will just have to yield priority... :-))

Rasch's paper illustrates a rule I've had for some years now:  If you
don't like a conclusion some historian of performance practice has reached,
just wait.
