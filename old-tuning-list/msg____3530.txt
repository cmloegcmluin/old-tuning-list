Subject: An interesting series of tunings

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

I just happened to notice that in many of the tunings (equal temperaments, 
to be precise) that I work with, seven steps gives you an interval where the 
lower note sounds like the root. Let's see what happens if we formalize this 
idea -- we want the lower note of the interval to correspond to a harmonic 
that is a power of 2 (so it sounds like the root), and the upper note to be 
the next higher harmonic:

Interesting tuning #n = round(7/(log((2^n+1)/2^n)/log(2)))

According to this formula, interesting tuning #0 is 7-tET, which is the 
standard tuning of Thailand. Siamese compositions modulate, usually by 
fifths, much like those in the West. As the only other culture that relies 
on modulation, Thailand is the only other culture that uses equal 
temperament (though I have heard that this practice extends into Cambodia).

Interesting tuning #1 is 12-tET. Apparently, interesting enough to satisfy 
the West for the last few centuries.

Interesting tuning #2 is 22-tET. This is my main avenue of research; contact 
me for more info. This is also the first equal tuning with consistent 
representations of all harmonies through the 12th harmonic. See previous 
digests for discussions of consistency.

Interesting tuning #3 is 41-tET. Recommended by Paul van Jenko around the 
turn of the century, this tuning is barely distinguishable from 9-limit just 
intonation. Try a "ninth chord" tuned (in cents) 0 380.5 702.4 965.9 1404.9. 
It also offers consistent representations through the 16th harmonic.

Interesting tuning #4 is 80-tET. This is the first equal tuning with 
consistent representations through the 20th harmonic. That pretty much 
covers any harmonies I would consider musically useful, and then some.

Interesting tuning #5 is 158-tET. Or it would be if there were anything 
interesing about it. Like most numerological speculations, such as 
Kornerup's and Yasser's, this one's luck runs out after a while. Then again, 
who am I to say that some great composer won't come along and demonstrate 
the wonderful properties of 158-tET?
