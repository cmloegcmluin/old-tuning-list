   The Ivor Darreg Memorial fund's policy is to simplify their accounting by
charging the same price everywhere.  That $14 price includes $2 of postage and
packing materials, which is a little bit more than the domestic shipping costs,
and somewhat less than foreign.  They didn't want to complicate their ads texts
by listing a half-dozen different prices, which if you'd have to do if you
charged everybody EXACTLY what shipping costs you.
