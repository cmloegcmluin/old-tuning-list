Subject: All the music is microtonal

From: Eduardo Sabat <esabat@adinet.com.uy>

ALL THE MUSIC IS MICROTONAL

There are several topics about this matter I've thought and surely many I
must learn, but, they are enough to affirm without any fair the title.

They are :
             ) Where the 12 is ?
             ) Musical writing
             ) Harmonics
             ) Just listen
             ) More than 12
             ) Sound Spectrum
             )

1) Where the 12 is ?
                             THEORY

   All the Pyth. scales bigger than 13 notes per Octave are microtonals,
because the comma appears with the Pyth. 14.
   What ? , Why I say 13 and 14 ? Where is the 12 ?
   If you want to make a joke to a friend first ask him how many notes are
there in one Octave, he do answer "8", and inmediately ask him how many
notes are there in a semitonic scale per Octave. Almost everybodies will
answer "12".
   The real answer is 13, because they are 12 plus 1, such of the Octave.
   8 amd 12 are paradigms, we the Tuners (sometimes) use de expression
"8/Oct" and "12/Oct" as equivalents to indicate the "obvious", it is 8/Oct
means 8 notes per Octave and 12/Oct means 12 tones per Octave. We understand
the meaning, no problem, but generaly we d'ont think that their "units" are
differents.
8 means total notes and 12 means note-names (or structural notes if we
like).So to equalize concepts if we use 8/Oct we must use 13/Oct, and if we
use 12/Oct we must use 7/Oct.
   I don't know if it was written something about this on the List.
   Does somebody knows ?

   Other fact contributing to the confusion is the double sence (it has
more) of the word "Tone" . 12tET is correct for 12 tones (intervals) and not
for 12 notes, and 8/Oct is OK for notes.
   The word Tone colloquially is sometime used as Note.
















 Keyboards and Fretboards.

The Piano and related has 12 key/Oct, and the Guitar and related also, has
12 frets/Oct.
