Why not bluegrass?  I hear that Mark Rankin, inheritor/distributor of the
Novatone interchangeable fretboards, has a JI banjo and demonstrated some
bluegrass tunes on it.  The 19 tone rock pieces by the Catler brothers sound
appropriate, and LaMonte Young's "Forever Bad Blues Band" bands rocks the
house.  Wendy Carlos' Switched on Brandenburgs and Bach 2000 show that
well-tuning Classical is well worth it (pun intended :).  I cringe when we
start talking about certain tunings only being applicable for certain types
of music.  

For styles that modulate, adaptive tuning systems such as the Hermode tuning
package used in the Waldorf Microwave are starting to come in. Does anybody
have direct experience with using the Microwave for tuning?
