Subject: Clavette update

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

All of you Dutch xenharmonicists should know that the original version of
the Clavette is now back at the Koninklijk Conservatorium in The Hague.
I have asked the director of the Institute of Sonology, Konrad Boehmer, to
be sure that the instrument is actually played by people, but I'm hoping 
that if student interest is insufficient, that the Dutch xenharmonic
community might negotiate some access to it.

I included my code and some other supporting materials in the case, but feel
free to contact me with any questions. 

In the meantime, I am notating my original works for it on computer, and am
preparing for a real concert including it. The "Electronic Performance Today" co
concert will take place in St. Paul sometime this spring, and will include
music composed and arranged for Clavette, tape music by me, and some
interactive improvisational computer music by Michael Pelz-Sherman. I am
also editing some video footage of my Clavette performances into a 30-minute
documentary. I plan to send copies of the computer-printed scores,and
probably at least a US-standard VHS tape of the final documentary, to the
Conservatory and to Stichting Huygens-Fokker in Amsterdam.

Of course, I'd be interested in hearing from any interested publishers for
those pieces, and from TV producers for broadcast of the completed tape.
However, given my long real-world job hours, these all will not be completed
for some months.

Happy xenharmonic holidays,

P.S. Many thanks to the Minnesota Composers Forum (soon to become the
American Composers Forum) for making the Landmark Center concert possible!
