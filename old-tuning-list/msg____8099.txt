Subject: Re: Microtunable wishlist

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Another thing :

Wouldn't it be preferable for any synth that incorporates decent 
microtuning to
not be sample based ,but rather generate its sounds using an actual 
synthesis technique,
like Physical Modelling,FM,etc. ?

I've read a number of warnings about the tendency of E-mu thingies to not 
transpose
samples properly. But natural, unless a sample is retuned only within +/- 
@ 4 whole-tones.

I'm for the better informed among you to make a nice neat wish list with 
2 levels 
of implementation and then we should send it over to Ensoniq.

Cheers,
Drew
