   DFinnamore :


 Set 28/ 97 must be remembered as the day where a very important Chapter of
the Tune-List's tuners begins . This Chapter could be called "Microtonal
ELEMENTS of the Musical Emotion". I believe that many Tuners have thought to
study or have written something about it (as I did). And I propose that
somebody could recopilate the information so that all tuners would be able
to contribute to the cause.=20
  This mater is VERY IMPORTANT because generally the ears of the musicians
are closed to the Microtonalism concepts.=20
  I know that there are many opinions about this matter displayed from the
beginning of the List, but on this occasion it is adecuate to begin, because
for some people the music is more or less the SAME, not depending on the
Gamut, and I understand this is the PRINCIPAL trouble we must fight.

We must not be afraid to try to define with our words what kind of emotion
we feel, because we think "we are not a Psychologist", and to know also that
each time we hear the same  music the "quantity" and "quality" of our
emotion or of our feeling must be different.
 To begin is to begin. =20
----------------------------------

Another matter I want to make a reference, is the fact that in my country,
at  least, all musicians think that the western music is based on 12tET and
I would like to know which acoustic instruments have been tuned or played in
such a way. There must be some now and also in other times but at all times,
would be the exception. On the other side it can be said that "the piano is
tuned approximately at 12tET", and I answer "why don't we say the piano is
aprox. Pythagoric ?", because  the 12tET can be defined by a row of fifths
minimized in one irracional Skhisma.    =20
And why do I say all of that ?, Because to promote the Microtonalism  is
necesary first to clean our house and to substitute the paradigm of the
"12tET" by the actual "Microtonalism", because

                 ALL THE MUSIC IS MICROTONAL   =20


 and this is not only a point of view or a way to classify the music
because from the study of ALL the music, each piece of music appertains to
some microtonal scale.   =20
The word Microtonal (and related) was coined by Julian Carrillo, I never
read his original work but I believe he used this term for intervals smaller
(let's say) than 256/243.
 And why do we call Microtonal to a scale like any 8/Oct ?  , because at
least any of the notes are appart in a microtone from its match note of the
Pythagoric criteria.

 And so on.
