Are you holding back on me?

Did you get an idea of what conclusions he reached?

So it's the width at various points?  How do you respond to the assertion
made by Ewan Macpherson that it's the stiffness at various points?

Actually, I've heard this before, but I've never heard what the whole story
actually is.

So it's the stiffness at various points?  How do you react to the statement
made by Jesse Gay that it's the width at various point?

And what does this have to say about Helmholtzian place theory, and its
explaination of the critical band phenomenon?
