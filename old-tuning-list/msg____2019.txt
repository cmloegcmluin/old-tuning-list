(Neal: I hope you don't mind my forwarding this to the alternative
tunings list, of which I'm a member and from which I think you'll get
some good responses.  Many of the people on that list--perhaps
most!--use synthesizers with non-ET intervals.)

I'm familiar with all the arithmetic involved in figuring out different
temperaments, and I also know what sounds good to me.  But I have no
convenient way of relating the two!  

I basically want to do John's singing experiment on a
computer/synthesizer combination.  That is, I would like to produce a
tone at (say) 400 Hz; produce an approximate 5th, play with it until it
locks in (and see the number 600 appear on the monitor); add in the third
(and see it lock in at exactly 500); etc.  

What do I need?  I have a Power Macintosh with microphone; Finale; a
not-great synthesizer keyboard (I don't have make or model with me).  Is
there any useful software or hardware that will do this without breaking
the bank?  (Note:  suggesting that I buy a harpsichord and hire a
full-time tuner to be at my beck and call doesn't count as useful.)

I would be grateful for suggestions.
