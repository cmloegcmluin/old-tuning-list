I wrote,

keyboard tuning.

I meant the _keys_ that are conventionally called A major, A-flat major,
C minor, and C-sharp minor, not (just) the _chords_ that go by those
names. Each of the keys has a consonant I, IV, and V chord which are
mutually exclusive from those of the other keys; hence there are 12
consonant 5-limit triads in this 12-out-of-22 keyboard mapping.
