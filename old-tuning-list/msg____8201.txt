I think Justonic's Pitch Palette is a good solution for adaptive tuning or
modulation in just intonation.  Before this came along you needed a
synthesizer with a large number of tuning tables.  This meant you needed a
Yamaha TX802, DX7IIFD or Kurzweil K2000/K2500, and a computer sequencer to
change the tuning tables.
