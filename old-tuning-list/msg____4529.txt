Subject: Scala 1.2 online

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Scala version 1.2 for PC is now online, the location is the same:

ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/pc/scala/scala.zip

It is a very complete freeware editor/librarian/analysis tool for
tunings. It allows scales to be created, manipulated and combined in
many different ways. A large library of scales is available for it. It
can tune various different synthesizers and samplers via standard
MIDI-files. To install, unpack scala.zip in an empty directory and
read the readme file. The ANSI.SYS screen driver must be installed.

Version 1.2 is an update with several new features, to name some:
- The MIDI Tuning Standard's bulk dump is now supported.
- A new command POLYNOMIAL/SOLVE finds roots of polynomials (for equal
  beating tunings).
- A new command EXAMPLE creates from a customisable template universal
  microtonal MIDI-files with the pitch-bend method and dynamic channel
  allocation.
- Fret positions can now be calculated.
- More items were added to the SHOW commands.
- A new command CHORDS shows chord approximations.
- Some commands were improved to accept a wider parameter range and more
  qualifiers. For example the MODE command now accepts a literal string of
  intervals.
- More tips were added.
- More keyboard mappings were added.
- More mode names were added.
- The interval list is now also in French.
- More command files are included to do scale manipulations.

Some minor bugs were fixed and one major one in the PIPEDUM command.
No backward-incompatible changes were made to the command language.
Thanks to Paul Erlich, Fred Kohler, Kami Rousseau and Eduardo Sabat
for their input with this version.
