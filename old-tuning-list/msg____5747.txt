   Again noting that I said, "about equally well in tune" and not
"identical sounding" in all keys, I'd say that that, and "inequality (but
acceptability) of different keys" are two different ways of saying the same
thing.

   The original premise of the question was that well temperaments get
farther out of tune as you venture farther from C Major.  Although
well-temperaments are not my specialty, I'm not aware of many, if any,
well-temperaments have that property.  I seriously doubt if ol' JS would
have written in F and F# in the same suite if he expected one to sound
wildly more out of tune than the other!

   In contrast, meantone tunings clearly would not fit this bill.  In a
narrow band of key frames they sound exactly identical, and outside that
band they sound far from "acceptable" as you put it, because of the wolf.
