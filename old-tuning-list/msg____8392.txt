Have now got this going, and it seems an excellent solution for 
PC-owning midi ignoramuses.  It can read tunings in the SCALA format, 
of which there is a huge library available, so I've had the experience 
of listening to my keyboard play in all sorts of strange temperaments.  
The file format for the tunings looks very simple, so it'll be easy to 
set up any other temperament one likes, as long as one can calculate 
the frequencies.  Definitely recommended.  Thanks to Graham Breed for 
making it available
