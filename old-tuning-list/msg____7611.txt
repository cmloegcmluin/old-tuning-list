I may be entirely wrong about this, but I think
that the generally heavier construction of the piano
(esp. the tuning block and frame) made the instrument
simply better able to hold a tuning over a longer
period of time and thus shifted the responsibility
for the tuning from the performer or instrument owner
to professional piano tuners. While most musicians
can learn to set a meantone or well temperament and
learn quickly to correct a tuning before and during
a rehearsal or performance, approximating an equal
temperament is a specialist activity and cannot be
done on the fly. Douglas Leedy speaks about
'invention being the mother of necessity' in this
case: because the piano was able to hold a tuning in
ET, it became necessary to tune it in ET.

There are arguments about ET and the piano based upon
the stretched intonation of the partials of the
rigid piano wire. I have great trouble in supporting
these arguments historically, however, because the
early pianos were wired at a much lower tension
than modern instruments and were considerably less
stretched. (La Monte Young's _Well Tuned Piano_ =

deliberately uses a lower tension to reduce, but not
eliminate the stretching. The actual tuning he uses
deviates considerably from just intonation when =

measured but is instead a subjectively convincing
approximation.)
