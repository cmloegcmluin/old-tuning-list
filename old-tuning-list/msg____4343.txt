Subject: MIDI2CS new version

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

There is a new version of the MIDI-file to Csound converter, see news
below. 
The 'midi2cs.cps' (cycles-per-second file) can also be generated with
Scala with the command: SEND/CPS midi2cs . Take a scale and a keyboard
mapping, do the above command, and you can run MIDI2CS.

                 MIDI2CS 0.95 beta (DOS 16bit - 95/12/01)
               at http://www.snafu.de/~rubo/songlab/midi2cs
  Intro

     This page is
        * an extension of Midi2Cs's manual for version 0.94
        * describing what has changed and how

     You'll find the headlines of this page by starting 'midi2cs' with
     option '-h' or option '?'.
                           midi2cs -h
     This option might help you to remember the new features after
     you've read this page.


  Environment variable MIDI2CS defined for config files directory

     Now you are able to define a config files's directory by adding
     the following line to your environment (e.g. autoexec.bat).

          set MIDI2CSirectory's path> (e.g. set
          MIDI2CS\csound)

     Midi2Cs 0.94 created a 'midi2cs.cps' (cycles-per-second file) and
     a 'midi2cs.pro' (projectfile) file in the same directory where
     you started it. Midi2Cs 0.95 looks up the config files's
     directory for these files.


  GM supported - 'midi2cs.gmi' (General Midi Instrument) config file

     A new file 'midi2cs.gmi' will be created in the config files's
     directory the first time you start Midi2Cs 0.95. This file is the
     new General Midi Instrument's configuration file. It looks like
     this:

          ; MIDI2CS - General Midi instrument table
          ; Program Number - Instrument (WAV, AIFF or ORC file)
          000 "" ;Acoustic Grand
          001 "" ;Bright Acoustic
          002 "d:\studio\samples\gm\acpiac3.aif" ;Electric Grand
          003 "" ;Honky-Tonk
          004 "" ;Electric Piano 1
          005 "" ;Electric Piano 2
          006 "" ;Harpichord
          007 "" ;Clav
          008 "" ;Celesta 009
          ...

     Just add your own *.aif, *.wav, *.orc (see Midi2Cs's manual)
     files to design your own individual General Midi Instrument set.
     Next time you run a conversion of a MIDIfile the instruments
     of this table will be used as presets for all tracks in your
     MIDIfile that contain GM program changes (the first change
     will be taken).


  Automatic lookup for global+local projectfile 'midi2cs.pro'

     Midi2Cs is able to read more than one projectfile. At first it
     looks for a 'midi2cs.pro' file in the config files's directory.
     Then it reads a possibly existing local 'midi2cs.pro' file. After
     that it might read a <filename>.pro file specified with option
'-r'
     in the commandline.

     My standard projectfile in the config files's directory only
     contains the following lines:

          # MIDI2CS PROJECT FILE 0.95 - rubo@berlin.snafu.de

          nameofscore date.sco
          nameoforc date.orc

          sr 44100
          nchnls 1
          givol 0.2

          firstbar 16
          lastbar 24

          drumchannel 10 off

          endofproject

     So the result after processing a midifile by calling 'midi2cs
     <filename.mid>' is a mono score output for 9 bars from bar 16 to
     bar 24 with samplerate 44,1 kHz excluding the MIDI drum channel.
     The mastervolume of 0.2 is good to start with to prevent digital
     distortion.


  Default tempo calculation when firstbar > 0 option added

     When option 'firstbar' in the projectfile was set bigger than 0
     the default tempo calculation was not always correct. Fixed.


  Wrong note specifiers in filename do not crash the program anymore

     Midi2Cs crashed when a samplefile's name ended like *h3.aif. The
     reason is that 'h'' in Germany. Fixed. There is no note 'h'
     that is calculated by Midi2Cs. It just takes default note c3 for
     a samplefile named *h3.aif.


  Option orcfile/scorefile 'date' creates date
  in score and orchestra filenames

     The idea is to get a new score and orchestra filename every day
     to see the progress in work and have a backup.
     If you specify the following options, the current date will be
     taken as name of the score and and the orchestra file.

          nameofscore date.sco
          nameoforc date.orc

     See my example projectfile some lines above.


  Duration calculation options '-' and '+' implemented

     The projectfile option 'duration' only took fixed values. Now you
     are able to add or substract milliseconds by adding a minus or
     plus sign at the beginning of the specified value like 'duration
     +300' or 'duration -50'.


  Specific event comment bug corrected

     There was a bug that produced unnecessary but harmless score
     output. Fixed.


  50 tracks supported

     Midi2Cs is able to convert standard midifiles up to 50 tracks
     into Csound score and orchestra files now. It will not crash if
     your file has more than these. You'll get a message.
