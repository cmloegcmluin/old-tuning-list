Subject: Re: Chinese 12TET - overkill?

From: Michael Wathen 556-9565 <Michael.Wathen@uc.edu>

Another source of interest is an article in the <Annals of 
Science>, Volume 44 (1987), pp.471-488.  The article by H. Floris 
Cohen is entitled "Simon Stevin's Equal Division of the Octave".
It analyzes his treatise "Vande Spiegheling der Singconst".  It 
argues that Stevin was trying to deal with the problem of 
Consonance of intervals.

	Through the analysis of the source material available...
	we find that Stevin's theory, which makes no sense if 
	interpreted as an early stage  in the 'evolution'of equal 
	temperament, was meant as a solution---as freshly 
	original as it was wrongheaded--to this perennial problem 
	of consonance, which has continued to baffle some of the 
	best scientific minds from the very beginning of  science 
	to the present day.

One of Stevin's ideas was that of considering the ratio of an 
equal tempered fifth as "true" and the just ratio 3/2 as an 
approximation!
