Subject: New freeware tuning program

From: wcooper@socrates.berkeley.edu

I have developed a general-purpose microtuning program and am
putting it on the net as freeware for the Mac.  It attempts to
integrate a number of utilities for tuning in real time as you play
and for tuning MIDI files.  It offers a tuning octave, autotuning by
chord following (any inversion), an ET escape key, some limited
stretch tuning, pedal-activated presets, spot retuning of files, and
other facilities.  Use temperaments from the menu or install your own.
It is limited to scales of twelve tones or less and is essentially
monotimbral.  It should work with most MIDI equipment.

     If there are people on the list with a 68K or power Mac and MIDI
system who would be interested in trying it out and reporting the
glitches to me, I would be grateful.  (I have already gotten rid of
about as many bugs as I can find for myself.)  My hope is that with a
little help this can be made into a really useful program--one good
enough to interest ordinary musicians in using tunings other than
equal temperament.

     It is on the web at
