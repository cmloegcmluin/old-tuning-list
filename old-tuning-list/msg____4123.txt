   Certainly in meantone tunings you don't want to use a D# in place of an Eb,
for example!  

   Brian's point, which seems to me at least to be largely correct, is that mass
producing keyboards with more than 12 tones per octave was not terribly feasible
in the times when meantone tunings were popular.  The only realistic solution
was to stick with 12 and tune them to well-temperaments instead.  

   As for whether that would qualify as a "revolution", I guess you can decide.
