Subject: RE: More on equal beating tunings

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Temperings with parts of the Pythagorean comma are usually circulating
temperaments. They have no wolf fifth. This implies that the Pythagorean
comma is distributed somewhat evenly along the circle of fifths.
Vallotti & Young are circulating temperaments with 6 fifths tempered
by 1/6 Pyth. comma and 6 pure fifths. 
The temperaments that I gave aren't circulating temperaments, and have
only one size of fifth (apart from the wolf).
However they could be completed with pure fifths after the cycle that
completes a whole Pythagorean comma. Or have the pure and tempered
fifths in another permutation. 
So for instance 1/11 Pyth. comma temperament would have one perfect
fifth and fourth, 1/10 Pyth. comma temp. could have that and a
Pythagorean minor seventh, 1/9 Pyth. comma that and a 32/27, and so
on. Of course that would decrease the number of equal beating triads
in the scale.
There remains one fifth that's tempered very nearly part of a Pyth.
comma in the equal beating temperaments presented. One in John's last 
post:
3/2 = twice 6/5  equal: 695.337, opposite: 694.13653
The latter is very very close to a 1/3 Pyth. comma tempered fifth.
