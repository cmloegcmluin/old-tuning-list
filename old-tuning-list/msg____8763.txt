   By the way, just to make sure that nobody gets any incorrect impressions
here, despite the name of the shop ("One Off CD") where the tuning-list CD was
made, these are not one-offs - those green CDRs, the one-time recordables. 
Neil was careful to make sure that this turned out as a full-blown, pressed CD
with custom-designed liner notes and all that.
