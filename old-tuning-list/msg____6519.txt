Subject: equal temp discussion

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Ed...my apologies for not quite getting my point across in the way
I intended...yes, I am aware that well temps were used by Bach and others.
What I was trying to do was make the point that temperaments, in general,
were an attempt to deal with music that modulated a great deal...I am
sure that Bach must have used equal at times, as in his Lute works, but
it seems that well temperaments were certainly in use in his time.
Believe me, I am no expert on that subject, and would be happy to study
and learn more about it. I find it interesting that, apparently, Bach
himself did not write in any detail about tuning systems...are there
any known quotes from him about this subject?
    Carl...your comments about the versatility of just are well taken.
Again, I don't think I got my point across very well...when I speak
about the practicality of equal temps as opposed to just, I am thinking
in a very broad sense, of many different instruments being able to
make music using tunings that are applicable to many different
situations. As you pointed out, the guitar might not even be useful
in some of the just tunings you refer to...so, it wouldn'd do me and
zillions of other guitarists much good. When you speak of a keyboard
that could play a just tuned Mysteries, I think that's wonderful
and meaningful...but, could a flute player solo over the changes on
a just flute? A sax? When all players can participate in pure tunings
on a practical, everyday level, then I think equal temperaments have
met their match.
    Morrison...I also need to back up a tad, and rephrase an earlier
comment about tunings with many notes being very difficult to play
chord changes (such as jazz) on. Actually, I believe I can do it on
my 31 tone axe, which I have not yet begun to work with too much...it
is for future projects. The 34 tone tuning, however, has that comma,
and that makes it hard, indeed, to play Charlie Parker stuff on.
Impossible? I cannot yet say, but I am sure I will give it a go in
a later date. There are physical realities connected with various
instruments...saxophones, for example, cannot play chords, no matter
what you do (maybe if you use an electronic harmonizer, but I mean
naturally). A tuning with a zillion notes does present physical
challenges, such as teensy frets on a guitar...chalenges are great,
and spur one on to greater goals. Right now, 19 tone eq is killer
for advanced bop stuff, and harder than shit to do...just try it
for yourself, and you'll see what I mean...if I want to make it
more difficult, than I'll perhaps write "Giant Steps" and others in 31.
Starrett has already suggested a project where we do jazz standards
in 31, so I am sure we will...Hstick
