This reminds me of something I've read about some Native American
musical traditions, namely that when making, let's say, a flute, the
builder would simply make the holes where they fell most comfortably
under his fingers, then learn the idiosyncrasies of the resulting scale
and use them in the music made on that flute.  I think some African
musicians may do something similar when they use the natural resonant
pitches of discovered objects in percussion instruments.  The
ethnomusicological term used for this kind of stuff is "found pitch".
