Having broadcast the piece a number of times, I can personally attest
that a) it's quite listenable b) it seems to attract the attention of
a number of those community radio listeners in the habit of calling the
station when they hear something that interests them. I try and explain
what Bill's said above, and point out that he's in the process of
releasing a CD of his intriguing musics. Just out of curiousity, what
other XRD stuff sounded interesting? Can one generalize? I wouldn't
mind trying to map an essential oil like Melissa, which I could then
collide with the Allman Brothers tune of the same name....
