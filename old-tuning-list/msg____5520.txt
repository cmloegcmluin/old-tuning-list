I have to agree with Dan, who, after all, said that "church" modes
continued to be central to music _education_. But even so, diatonic modes
other than major or minor return most obviously to art music in France in
the late nineteenth century, as in pieces by Chabrier, Debussy, Satie,
Faure, and in the twentieth century by many composers, including Ravel,
Bartok, Copland, Vaughan Williams and so on. And as Dan points out, many
European folk songs are in diatonic modes other than major or minor.

I don't see why refering to major and minor as modes is misleading. In my
definition of modes in the European tradition, they include at least the
following defining characteristics:

1) A tuning system, though it may be somewhat flexible as long as the
general pattern of intervals (below) remains recognizable.

2) A subset of pitches from that tuning system, or, put another way, a
pattern of intervals. (In the European tradition this means the diatonic
set.)

3) A tonal center within that subset.

Given that there are seven pitches in the diatonic set, there are thus
seven possible diatonic modes, of which major and minor are only two. I
don't see how they are different than the other diatonic modes. (Well, the
existence of multiple "minor scales" is a rather arbitrary theoretical
construction that has more to do with harmony and counterpoint than modes
per se. I don't think the altered scale degrees fundamentally change the
impression of diatonicism -- see below.)

In other non-European (or earlier European) traditions, there are
theoretical pitch constructions that roughly correspond to "mode," but they
often involve further defining characteristics. Thus, you can either
jettison the term "mode" (as many do), or augment the definition with some
of these other defining characteristics:

4) A range.

5) Characteristic melodic motives.

6) Characteristic methods of ornamentation ("ornamentation" here defined
broadly).

7) A further hierarchy of pitches or other categorization of pitch
functionality.

8) Extramusical associations.

As long as we're on the subject:

Some modes have what I would call "auxiliary tones" (though they are not
usually part of what defines a mode as I see it). I think of them as tones
that lie outside of the pitch set that are used more or less as occasional
passing tones or temporary substitutes for notes in the pitch set for
various musical reasons (such as the sharpened leading tone in minor). I
sometimes compare the pitch sets of various modes using a shorthand
notation:

Number of pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the
subset/number of commonly used auxiliary tones.

(Note: I should qualify the below numbers with the statement that the
distinction between auxiliary tones and other pitch inflections is not
always clear, that when a pitch is within or outside of the pitch set is
likewise sometimes a subjective judgment, and that the use of modes
depends, of course, on the music itself, so understand that these are
generalizations.)

Thus traditional diatonic modes are:

12/7/0

Minor with sometimes a raised seventh or sixth scale degree:

12/7/2

Pelog patet:

7/5/1

Slendro patet (most of the time):

5/5/0

Chinese pentatonic modes (according to some theoretical sources):

12/5/2

Defining raga this way gets tricky, depending if you think of a 12 or 22
pitch tuning system and which tones are "auxiliary." (In the North Indian
tradition, Bhatkande has already made these judgments for us.) Here's my
take on Hindustani raga des:

12/7/1
