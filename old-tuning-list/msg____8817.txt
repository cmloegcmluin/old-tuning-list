Subject: color lattice on website

From: monz@juno.com

For those of you who would like to see
a very lovely full-color version of my
11-Limit Lattice, go to:

http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/11-l-c.bmp

If you can't open it that way, try going
to my Lattice page and download it from the
link (right under the black-and-white
11-Limit Lattice):

http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices.htm

I'd like to put this right on the lattice page,
but it takes too long to download as a .bmp.  I
have no way to convert it to a .gif or .jpg --
if anyone out there can do it for me and send me
the file, I'd appreciate it.
