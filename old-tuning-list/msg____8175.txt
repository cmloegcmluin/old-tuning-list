Subject: Drew Skyfire's DSP note

From: Rick Sanford <76122.2237@compuserve.com>

Hi Drew:

You wrote after hearing of the SCOPE, by German Co.
I looked again at Creamware.  Sorry I didn't make the connection
right away.  They have some SUPER products, and are right in the
pocket with DSP-type development. Their Wolf Roth was given 
a SSAIRA award for their Audio Editor.

And we shouldn't suggest that the Workstation-style of
synthesis won't slowly take over, despite 'seeming' more expensive.
I'd be very interested to see what this new device you've heard of
is doing.  Hopefully they'll be demonstrating it at Karlsrhue in
November.  Don't forget AES is in San Fran this Fall, maybe there.

Although, in this market, you might be better off taking the $6500
and doing a straddle in the currency futures market, say buying
Deutsch Marks forward to expire on Dec 17 (before the EU currency
kicks in).

Then again, maybe we need a whole new forum called 
"financial derivatives based on the 7/4 interval"
Cheers:
Rick S.
