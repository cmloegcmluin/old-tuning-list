The forum CD is available for sale from Haverstick for $12.00 ($15.00 
overseas) postage paid at P.O. box 150271 Lakewood CO 80215. I am 
currently offline and as soon as I get back on, I will communicate with 
the participants to arrange shipping. Of course other participants will 
probably be selling CDs soon and you may wish to purchase one from them.
