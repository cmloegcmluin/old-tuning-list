   I started to answer that question with a series of dreadful textbookish
definitions, but the answer would almost certainly clearer by example.  

   In the key of C major, an authentic cadence is the chord progression from the
chord GBDF to CEG.  In C minor, it would be GBDF to CEbG.  

   That is as opposed to a plagal cadence (for example) which in C major is FAC
to CEG, or FAbC to CEbG in C minor.  Or as opposed to (probably) the most common
form of deceptive cadence:  GBDF to ACE.  

   Obviously you can transpose those progressions into whatever key you'd like.

   That progression (the authentic cadence) is extremely common in Western music
as a whole, but I seem to recall - again, perhaps incorrectly - that virtually
all chords in barbershop work are (dominant) seventh chords.  In that case you
would not technically have an authentic cadence, since the tonic chord would be
a seventh chord.  (That could be used as a fragment of a chain of secondary
dominants, but perhaps I ought not get into that.)
