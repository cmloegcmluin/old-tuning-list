Subject: New Birdhouse cd is out

From: David Beardsley <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

The new CD by New York JI microtonalists
Jon Catler & Meridith Borden is out.

I updated the web page again this morning.


Here's some info....

FreeNote Records is pleased to announce the
release of the debut CD by Birdhouse.
With this 11-song CD, Birdhouse has taken
actual microtonal transcriptions of birdsong, as
well as songs inspired by birds and expressed
them through an extended 13-limit system of Just
Intonation. Called Natures Tuning System, Just
Intonation is a naturally occurring set of notes
which covers a deep range of true consonance and
dissonance.  Birdhouses far reaching vision blends
this extended palette with a new level of artistry;
The results are magical and unique, a flight into the Beyond.

Hovering in new musical territory, Birdhouse joins
the unique talents of innovative guitarist and
composer, Jon Catler and coloratura songstress,
Meredith Borden.  The strength of this collaboration
has evolved through years of touring, recording,
and developing a pioneering language fueled
by the primal energy of rock, blues and minimalism.
This Birdhouse CD creates an aviary of sound,
highlighting the special talents of multi-instrumentalist
Brad Catler on percussion and fretless bass,
flutist Andrew Bolotowsky, and drummer Jonathan Kane;
furthermore, on its classic peace anthem Bird of Pray,
Birdhouse introduces a  microtonal choir featuring the
voices of Carla Buffa, Paul Matsumoto and Joseph Liebhart.


What people are saying about Birdhouse:

Confident and convincing......
Anthony Tommasini, The New York Times

These two highly talented people make up a killer duet...
Gene Pritsker, The New Music Connoisseur

Catlers microtones combined with Bordens to
create convincing oundscapes....
Peter Spencer, NJ Star Ledger

You dont expect birds to sing in the 12 notes
of the equal tempered scale, so you shouldnt
expect Meredith Borden or Jon Catler to play
in that scale either!
John Schaefer, WNYC, New Sounds
