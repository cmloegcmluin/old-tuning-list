Subject: interchangeable fretboard kits

From: adam james wilson <ajwilsn1@students.uiuc.edu>

Hello everyone. . .

I'm trying to convert my guitar for use with interchangeable
fretboards; as far as I can tell, a Mark Rankin owns the rights
to sell such conversion kits.  Unfortunately, I haven't been
able to locate him; does anyone happen to know him or know how
I might get in touch with him, or, does anyone know of any other
individuals or companies supplying these  kits?
