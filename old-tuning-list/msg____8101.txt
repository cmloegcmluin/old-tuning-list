Subject: Synth tuning resolution

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

About getting the kind of resolution that Dave Hill and Charles Lucy 
wrote about :
The 0.1 should be easy . 

But this :

Maybe when they defrost us from those cryonic tanks,eh ?

But seriously folks, one way we can get this is in software synths.
As I mentioned before,the Max-MSP combo already does floating point 
Hz accurate tuning.

Another way is using samplers. You can use a software synthesis system 
like
Csound, CLM,etc.,etc. to synthesize a whole bunch of samples at any pitch 
you 
want, perfectly tuned. Then if you can figure out a way to get them into 
a sampler ASAP with little pain and time ( and have the RAM for it), 
you're done. 
It would take mucho RAM, @ 100Kb for ea. mono sample @ one second long.
I don't think looping all those samples to conserve memory is a good way 
to keep sane.
Besides, I think David First said something important about the nitty 
gritty of the 
looping process.
If you need to set up all 128 MIDI notes, that's 100Kb * 128 = @12.5MB per
"instrument",per layer (if you need velocity switching samples,etc).
It would take one of those 128MB samplers to pull it off.
