Subject: k. stockhausen and other peoples tunings

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

not to sling mud at karl but when i was familiar with him and other students
of his (den haag fall of '82) it was often chattered that karl ripped off from
his students. i don't know if this is a fact. i don't know anyone directly
stolen from _BUT_ the guys character and ego would lead me to believe he would
do so with little hesitation. that on top of the fact that when he lectured on
his own works his emphasis was completely large-form based almost as if the
indiviual notes werent very important. now if a guy that thought like that
went about using a tuning someone else invented i would suspect he would be
a little hesitant to admit it since "the meat" of the piece or at least that
delicious piece of fat on the side really wasn't his.

i find attitudes like stockhausen's lamentable. i think it is very important
to openly build on ground others have laid. that's what culture is about.
and i really feel that it was and is this lack of generousity of spirit
that killed 20th century "serious" music. don't get me wrong folks there are
works by stockhausen, boulez, berio etc. etc. that i adore but because of the
adamant attitude that the performer and audience should run to the artist and
never the reverse the audience got tired and stayed home. anyway i think i'm
rambling...
back to the point- yeah he probably did rip partch off and that would be a
good thing if he just could admit it.
