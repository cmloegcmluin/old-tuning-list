Subject: Re: Werner "Journal of Psychology" Interval Expansion

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I'm a bit behind in my E-mail, so this is in response to Brian Mclaren's
quote of Heinz Werner in Journal of Psychology.  Here's part of the quote:  "A
subject, when presented with a arelatively small interval of--let us say--0.12
of a semitone, at first may hear a very slight indefinite difference between the
two tones, or even no difference at all.  But when the same interval is repeated
a great many times with the subject deliberately focussing his attention on the
task of discerning a clear-cut interval, there will almost invariably be
reported an apparent enlargement of the objectively constant interval."  

   I can relate to this effect myself, along with a few other really strange
interval-size change effects from repeated listening.  Probably the strangest
one to me is when I practice singing 7:6 vs 6:5 sub/minor thirds.  When I
practice those intervals only continuously for 5 minutes or so, I often find
that when I quickly expand outward to sing 5:4s and 3:2s, the 5:4 sound like
perfect fourths, and the 3:2s seem like octaves!  Anybody else ever experienced
anything like that?  It's really a weird feeling.
