Subject: phonons, speculation

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Re Phonons: I thought phonons were essential to understanding
solid-state physics, especially low-temperature superconductivity.
In the mesoscopic realm, however, acoustic frequencies would form a
continuum and are no longer quantized.

One might suppose that the lowest possible non-zero frequency would
be the one which forms a standing photonic wave in the whole
universe considered as a Helmholtz or hollow, spherical resonator.
Of course, this frequency diminishes as the universe expands,
ultimately going to zero if the expansion continues, or stopping at
some finite value if Omega is 1, and rising again if the universe
re-collapses (which it probably won't).

I doubt any universal acoustic waves could exist at the present epoch,
but there must have been some before and just after the inflationary
period.

I don't know if standing gravitational waves are even possible, but
there is another spectrum to consider.

These speculations are probably more appropriate to Ray Tomes's
Cycles List than Alternative Tuning. BTW, Ratbert in the Dilbert
comic strip has discussed somewhat similar matters. Scott Adams may be
satirizing the scientists who "dissed" the speculations in his
latest book. (My apologies to those of you who don't see this comic
strip in your daily newspapers).
