	Yes, the original post mentioned only the keyboard embodiment, but 
the patent includes pictures of guitar, brass and wind embodiments, also. 
I have not seen the whole patent, only the claims and the drawings, and 
perhaps I am being a little paranoid. I have written to Yamaha asking 
them to clarify their position regarding manufacture of 19TET instruments 
by entities other than themselves.
	There is plenty of prior art out there to invalidate all but the 
most creative claims for new musical instruments, but when large 
corporations get legal means to profit from a popular idea, they usually 
are very aggressive in their approach. Am I paranoid then? No, I guess I 
was just a little tightly wound. Woaa! What was that????..........Aggghhh!
