Subject: Microtonal (or any) authenticity

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Well, respected elders, learned scholars, kids:


John Starret asks --

>What do you think? By what are we bound in the interpretation of another 
>microtonalist's music?
[...snip...]
>It seems to me that a sensitive arrangement of Partch for string quartet 
>is entirely appropriate, as long as the tonality is respected.

Question is: should I respond on the list or to John personally? It was
nigh well one year ago, on July 12, 1996, when O Absent One (Brian McLaren)
first broached the subject. It got me into the fray, and really (*really*),
matters Partchian have been churning ever since!

It may be very old hat at this point; OTOH, there might be new members
since then that aren't aware of some of the, if not 'educated', then
'experienced' voices in this matter. I've had just brief correspondences
with John Starret, who is a great resource online, and we can work
off-list, I'm sure.

If you want to see the original go-around, they were one of the first
pieces of ... content on Corporeal Meadows, still ensconced at:

I'll let one or two cycles of the digest go around (hmmm...cycles) before
coming in again. Bye!

Cheers,
Jon

P.S.
>Hell, John Schneider plays 
>Partch on his guitar and doesn't get slapped around (as far as I know).

As an aside, I have spoken with John Schneider at length about this,
including disagreements. That said, there is a world of, a galaxy of, a
mighty universe of difference between someone recreating an instrument the
work was composed for to perform it as intended, and someone transcribing
it for not only an unintended but *unwanted* ensemble. Pure poop.
