French Spectral composers, such as Tristan Murail, have used 48-tet when
employing electronics.  As far as the instrumental writing is concerned,
perhaps the composers are intending for the performers/conductor to listen
and to tune in to what is going on.  Something like what Ravel was up to
with all those parallel intervals in Bolero which are written in 12-tet or
the way a good conductor tunes parallel intervals in Le Sacre (notated in
12-tet, of course).  The analogies here to Western rhythmic notation and
performance practice are obvious.
