Subject: Meantone center?

From: "Bob Lee" <quasar@wco.com>

Ascend11@aol.com (sorry I don't know your name) wrote about the difference
between sixth comma and quarter comma meantone piano tunings. Fascinating -
especially the part about the natural vibrato effect of sixth comma.

My question - which key do you use as the center of your meantone tunings?
