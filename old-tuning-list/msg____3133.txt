Subject: Diary of a CD-R Novice

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
        I have been away from the computer for a few days due to the
wedding of a son and a promise to a wife to paint the house. Yesterday I
got back to work and set out to resolve a problem that consumed about 3
hours of time since I first hooked up the CD-Recordable and the to the
Adaptec SCSI card---my Gateway 2000 computer could not find the SCSI
device.
        Thursday-after 4 hours of trying every combination of available IRQ 
and base address, screaming at the computer, Adaptec and Gateway 
technicians, we determine that the problem is in the advanced BIOS of the 
Gateway machine-it is set to plug & play and assigns IRQs as it sees fit. 
I reset the BIOS to user setup and the SCSI drive is recognized! 
(I am not a genuine computer geek--I just use the computer for scienfic 
number crunching and visual simulations, so if you must call me on my poor 
use of DOS and hardware terminology, please do so in a gentle fashion).
	I am finally ready to record. I have three CD-R software 
packages-Correl, EZ CD-R and one that came with the CD-R player. I try 
the EZ CD-R software first. A CD-R can be recorded over several sessions,
which is a good thing, as standard CD audio takes about 10 megabytes per 
minute and a hard disk would be quite full from an hour of music. After 
each session, a box is clicked to close the session. When the disk has 
all the material recorded (data, programs, music, images or multimedia) 
you click the close disk box and the CD-R can finally be read. I have 
several disks with test data that have not yet been closed, so in the 
interest of economy, I first try recording DOS from my hard drive to the 
disk. It takes about ten seconds to put DOS in the appropriate format and 
about three minutes to burn it on the disk. I close the disk (about one 
minute) and I have my first CD ROM. I test it, and it works! The machine 
reads DOS from the CD-R!  
	Now for music. Each of the three software packages has a test 
feature that simulates writing a disk by doing everything but turning on 
the laser. As I don't have a whole disk worth of material to record, and 
special preparation is required to mix sound and other sources, I cannot 
use one of the partially recorded test discs. To avoid wasting a new 
disc, I decide to test write some wave files. I take several Monty Python 
sound bytes, sing a few bars into WINDAT (it came with my $50 sound card) 
and make a cue sheet. Piece of cake. It takes about five minutes. Just 
drag and drop WAVE files into the CD-R icon. I test record, and it is a 
success!
	Except for the 7 wasted hours trying to determine why the machine 
couldn't locate the SCSI device (ain't DOS machines grand?), running the 
CD-R has been a breeze. Each of the three pieces of software is easy and 
intuitive to use, and there were no glitches recording a real DOS CD and 
the test sound CD. All that remains is to do a real sound session, which 
I will report on next time.
	By the way, Sony now is pricing a fully functional CD-R drive at $600.
