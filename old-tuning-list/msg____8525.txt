Subject: Aside:  Home Recording Website

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

This isn't strictly tuning-related, but relevant to most of us anyway.

   I recently posed a home-recording question to rec.audio.pro, and got a
response from the author of a website on home recording.  I've only looked
at it briefly, but it seems to be pretty cool from what I've seen of it so
far.
