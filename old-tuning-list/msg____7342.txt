Subject: not every multisample is really tuned to a multiple of 100 cent?

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.or.jp>

Thanx Ken for the QT info,

Now I know which is the right wy to play microtone bu QT I would also 
follow the way you choose.....now beginning to use the word "about that 
much"..

>I don't bother rounding off bends in MIDI files since they're intended
>to be played on different machines with different PB precisions, 

BTW.
Someone told me this...this one will become rather bigger oh my Buddha!

> cents, which is not too bad. A bigger error source in QT (and other
> sample based synths) with microtuning is that not every multisample is
> really tuned to a multiple of 100 cent, i.e. a precise halftone.
