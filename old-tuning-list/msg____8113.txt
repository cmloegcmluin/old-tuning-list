of course what I meant is that there is an area of the memory which 
can be written to (otherwise you couldn't change the parameters etc) 
but which doesn't take up _sample_ RAM.  Exactly what you call this  
area of memory, what it is, how it works, etc, I'm no expert at (as 
you'll just have gathered).  Presumably it's some kind of RAM 
reserved for stuff nearer the operating system level.  I'm sure John 
Loffink used a term to describe it once, but I haven't time to search 
for it right now.  In haste again  -
