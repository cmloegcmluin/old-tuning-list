Here's a warning: not all MIDI instruments respond in the same way.
SoundBlaster cards, in particular, have a very strange correlation between
pitchbend data and the ammount of bend applied.

I usually find each pitchbend that I need by comparing the pitchbent note with
the tuning table-tuned note simultaneously, and adjust by ear.  It's a pain
but it insures that the pitches are as close as possible to exactly right.
