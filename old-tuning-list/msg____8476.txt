Yes, it's been discussed once or twice here before.  The fifths
C-G-D-A-E and B-F# are each tempered 1/5 Pythagorean comma, and all
other fifths are just.  (The same fifths are tempered in Kirnberger III,
only by different amounts.)  I'm skeptical about the beat rates being
special in any perceptible way, however.  The idea that the temperament
was encoded in JSB's seal (another of Kellner's claims) also seems
dubious to me, although my reading of Kellner is sketchy--most of what I
know is secondhand.  I'd like to know more, though--it may be he has
better supporting arguments than I know of.  I guess I need to improve
my German.
