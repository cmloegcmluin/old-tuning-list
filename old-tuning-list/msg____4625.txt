you'd have no idea that 1*9 is the same pitch as 1*3*3, if you have a 
separate axis for 9. ''

I find that an attractive part of the discipline of working in a
(non-stellated) CPS is not using compound factors as supplementary tones -
as in your example, using 1*9 as 1*3*3. It may sometimes be handy to have
''extra identities'' in this way, but in fact, placing compound factors on
their own axes makes the whole structure of the set more transparent, and
makes a whole range of operations upon the set considerably more clear. I
enjoy, for example, composing a bit of music and then reassigning the
factors, to generate a variation where the contours and intervals are
totally different, but the set properties maintained. 

(By the way, Erv Wilson's elegant graphs of some CPSes - some are abstract,
those with numbers assign compound factors to separate axes -  are found on
the covers of Xenharmonikon 1, 4, IX, XV.  For the cover of Xenharmonikon
XII, Wilson has assigned tones to the vertices of a Penrose tiling.)

You asked:

''What's this?''

A resolution of 1.56 cents. So that a 3/2 is approximated by an offset of 1
unit, but a 9/8 by 3 units. So for the TX81Z the best 9/8 is not equal to
the sum of 3/2s.
