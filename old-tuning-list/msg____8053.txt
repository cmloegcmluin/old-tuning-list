Yes, but if you extrapolate from key A to key B and the desired interval is
not an exact integer cents division you might get some small error (1 cent
per range) in the extrapolation.  Normally, you define a full octave and
extrapolate that.

That's the highest resolution of the MIDI Tuning Standard.  It's not useful
for me, but is for some people doing drones.  By high end I'm really
referring to computer synthesis type programs, not your everyday keyboard
synthesizer.  This should be spelled out in the wishlist.  MIDI response
isn't fast enough to make that pitch resolution usable due to phase
cancellations, as discussed previously in the list.

Manufacturers will think we're crazy asking for 0.1 cent resolution.  I'll
probably rephrase the pitch resolutions as "to 0.1 cent or best possible
cents resolution" and add some exposition to the requests.  In a wavetable
synthesizer the underlying samples would never be tuned to that accuracy. 
Sorry, but it's true.  Writing some new code is one thing, but
manufacturers are not going to order their sound development groups to tune
everything to 0.1 cent accuracy just for us microtonalist's benefit.  That
would be a huge labor effort on their part.  The idea is to keep this as
simple as possible, thereby raising the probability that these ideas will
be implemented.

I'm open to any ideas on this.  I got the idea from the Justonic folks.  I
use new note only updates myself.  They were more inclined to real-time
updates, giving as an example barbershop quartets where a pitch swoop
wouldn't be out of place.  The MIDI Tuning standard also requests real-time
updates.  Do we really need both types available simultaneously?

Again, we need to keep things simple for the manufacturers.  Measurements
in cents is all we need to define any scale.

It's a good idea to give something like this as an example, but phrase them
as being options.  It's important to break away the things that make
microtuning convenient from those that make it possible.  Asking or
demanding too much work from the software engineers who write these
programs is likely to get us nothing in return.  I'd really like to see any
possible simplifications to the wishlist.
