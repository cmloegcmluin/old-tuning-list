If you are referring to the normal curve model I proposed, the answer is, 
the same ones! It's a monotonic decreasing function of the sum of the 
squared errors, so minimizing the latter is the same as maximizing the 
former. If nothing else, the function is nice because is gives all tunings a 
rating between zero and one.

What is this referring to?
