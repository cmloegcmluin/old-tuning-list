I agree whole-heartedly. I was reminded of this misunderstanding when
recently rereading Mathews' and Pierce's "The Bohlen-Pierce Scale." In the
introduction are the misleading statements:

"The diatonic scale has provided a basis for most Western music since the
seventeenth century."

and:

"The major triad provides the harmonic basis for the diatonic scale."

In fact, the diatonic scale (at least as I define it) has been the basis
for most European music since the early Middle Ages (at least that which we
know through theoretical works or notation). It's impossible to know
precisely when, though I have long been fascinated by this issue.

Major and "natural" minor are two possible diatonic modes. I believe they
were used long before Glareanus recognized them in theory as separate
heptatonic entities (I presume that's who the seventeenth century reference
was to).

Certainly by the seventeenth century, composers were mainly interested in
harmony, and "standard" 5-limit JI can be derived through interlocking
4:5:6 triads. But to phrase it as Mathews and Pierce have, it would seem
that the diatonic scale was invented in order to accomodate the triad, when
in fact it was "invented" centuries before the triad.

I don't think this "invalidates" the Pierce-Bohlen scale -- it's absolutely
a valid approach to derive a scale based on the harmonies one wants. I just
don't think the diatonic scale, or even the major mode, was derived this
way.

I look forward to your paper. Personally, I think Yasser had a lot of great
ideas with a lot of ethno-centrist, Darwinist and ultimately unnecessary
ethno-historical nonsense to try to justify them.
