Subject: visit from Harold Fortuin

From: monz@juno.com

We in San Diego had the pleasure of hosting
Harold Fortuin the last two days, on a visit
from Minneapolis.

Harold brought along his Clavette, an ingenious
and _very portable_ keyboard -- important words to
microtonalists with lots of notes!  I want one.

He played some of his music for us, and I personally
really liked one called "Endangered Species" in
20-ET.  He also jammed with us in an nice improvisation
tuned in the subharmonic scale.

Here's the URL for the Clavette:
