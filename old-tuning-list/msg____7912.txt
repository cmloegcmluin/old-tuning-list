If the carrier is set to fixed frequency mode then it doesn't track MIDI,
so it would be useful only for drones since the program only plays one
note.  A non-multitimbral Yamaha FM synth wouldn't even be able to play a
chord this way.  Besides, the frequency resolution is still less than the
tuning tables.
