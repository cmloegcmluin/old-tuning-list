That sounds like fun.  

   There is a technical consideration to work through carefully though:
Fretless plucked strings other than the bass (since its strings are very heavy)
tend to be somewhat muffled and have very short transients because of friction
with the flesh of fingers.  That is not necessarily bad of course, but it would
undoubtedly affect how you would approach the musical styles you render on those
instruments.  Bowed strings of course don't have to worry about his because
you're continuously imparting energy to the string.  

   You suggested a fretless banjo.  Like the Turkish one Ivor had, that would
probably get around the muffling concern handily.  It could become yet more
percussive though, since the banjo is already more percussive from having an
extremely resonant top (a drum head) that dissipates the energy of the pluck
very rapidly - in a rapid, loud, short burst.  

   That does bring to mind an interesting thought:  Has anybody experimented
with attempting to get a fretted-like sound from a fretless instrument by
playing them with, essentially, thimbles on the left hand?
