I'll be waiting!

My own feeling is that it is used, in part, to obscure the size of the   
intervals they are required to match.  It is certainly harder to hear an   
interval *as an interval* as opposed to hearing two notes when there is   
warbling going on.  The first time I heard vocal ensembles without it was   
breathtaking.  Of course, no keyboard was involved there, so they *could*   
sing pure intervals.

There is

.. and to use intonation as an expressive device as well?

Not subliminal, I think, but audiences don't know why things sound   
different.  Like your dean, they are fully aware that the middle section   
is more tense, they just don't notice that the thirds and fifths are   
different and that's why.  Maybe it's really better *not* to reveal the   
secret - more accolades for the performer this way!

   

>What was "intended" is, by now,  a "debated-to-death" point.

Yes indeed.  My question about the Bach and Bull (hmm... sounds like the   
name of a pub...) was largely rhetorical.  Both have been discussed on   
the harpsichord list, and the Bach was fought over on this one a year or   
two ago.  We tend to take a fairly rigid attitude to tuning today.   
 Personally, I think composers back then were more flexible, treating it   
more as a performers option, within certain bounds, like ornamentation.   
 After all, their descriptions were not precise: "Narrow the fifths by as   
much as ye ear will permit."  How helpful!

Keep up the good work!

The Mean-Tempered Clavier!!  One of these days I'm going to try it, just   
for grins.
