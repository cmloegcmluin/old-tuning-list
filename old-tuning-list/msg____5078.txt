Subject: Pisa concert report

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

dear friends,

I'm going back from Pisa, Italy, where I made some concerts (Mediateca,
ArsenaleMusica 97)and a "seminaire" about microtonality (Conservatoire of
Livorno).
The program of the "microtonal" concert was:

* December 42 - H.PARTCH for voice and adapted guitar

* Preludio - J.CARRILLO for 1/4 tone guitar

* U Lamentu - P.GRANADEL three pieces for flute and 1/4tone guitar

* Suite op 63 (extracts) - A.HABA for 1/4tone guitar

* Invensjson op.32 - B.FONGAARD for 1/4tone guitar

* La ritournelle et le galop - P.CRITON for 1/16tone guitar

* Barstow - H.PARTCH for voice and adapted guitar

with amelie Berson, flute & vincent Bouchot, baryton

It was the premiere in Italy of all the pieces(I think), so the place was
completly full of people, some coming from hundreds of kilometers. The
concert received a very big success and of course Harry PARTCH was the
composer of the evening...
