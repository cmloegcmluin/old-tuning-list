I'd be interested in seeing some quantifiable info about this.
Have there been experiments which prove this statement?
I think this is an important and overlooked aspect of the prime/ odd
debate in this forum.  Lemme see some numbers.

[Monzo:]
Well, Paul, the reason you say these things is because you favor
ETs, where you must be concerned with consistency, approximations,
etc.  In real just tuning, the differences are quite audible.  The
5-limit
tritones provide a biting dissonance in the "dominant 7th" chord
that *demand* resolution onto the major or minor triad on the "tonic".

A perfectly tuned 4:5:6:7 chord is only a tiny bit less consonant
than a plain old 4:5:6 triad.  There's a big difference in the sound
and feel from the 3- and 5-limit "dominant 7th"s, provided they are
in perfect tune also.  And we're not talking about the tritone dyad
by itself, we're talking about a 4-part chord.

[Erlich:]

[Monzo:]
It's important to remember that the 36:45:54:64 dominant 7th chord
arose as a result of using a circumscribed set of pitches.  In a
5-limit system which is using only the 7 diatonic scale pitch-classes,
this particular set of proportions could only occur over the dominant.

I really think that in perfect just tuning, the 3- or 5-limit chords as a
whole beat too much to be nailed down as a 4:5:6:7

However, I'm am willing to grant the possibility that Erlich's idea
may have some validity.  I certainly agree that in hearing the
music the 3- or 5-limit tritones would normally be interpreted as
the much simpler 7:5  _if we are isolating the tritone_.

[Monzo:]
I'm glad you didn't misinterpret me here: I should have
specified that the "target" would be a lower-prime/
lower-odd ratio.  You're exactly correct that any of
these more complicated ratios would imply a 7:5
(or 10:7, depending on context).
