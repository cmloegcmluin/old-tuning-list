This is a really neat page, with very pretty music. More "info" is at
http://www.primasounds.com/lostchrd.html and
http://www.primasounds.com/mega.html. The flavor of the "theory" is sort
of a cross between Danielou and Lucy. The text is a little bit ambiguous
as to the exact tuning. Can anyone decipher it from the .wav or .mid
files at the site? My guess is that it is based on a chain of four 7/4s:

Ratio		Cents
1/1		0
2401/2048	275
343/256		506
49/32		738
7/4		969

(although the page does suggest that "very little tempering" is used to
adjust these frequencies for some reason). This resembles some Javanese
and/or African scales, doesn't it? The third mode has a meantone-like
fifth above the tonic:

Ratio		Cents
1/1		0
8/7		231
64/49		462
512/343		694
7/4		969
