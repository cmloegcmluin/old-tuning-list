Subject: Re: Systematizing Tuning Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Ooo.  I'd better stop babbling about this, but there's one other
equally-important consideration about systematizing tuning:  And that is to
what degree your nonsystematization is based upon chaos or exception.  

   To illustrate by extreme example, sticking with a strict system for all
but one note can sound very awkward.  That's kind of like sticking a note
from an electric guitar in the middle of a string quartet!  But clearly if
your entire composition is based upon unsystematic pitch, then no one note
is likely to "stick out" relative to any other.  The overall result will
make more musical sense, even though it's more truly random.
