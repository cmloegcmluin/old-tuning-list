From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

1200 cents is an invention by a Westerner to decipher the distinctions of
different cultural tunings.  It need not emphasize the 12ET points: that
is a grid only of the mind.

Ethnomusicology was developped as an alternative to Historical Musicology,
which tended to ignore non-Western musics.  First ethnomusicology was
originally called "Comparitive Musicology" but the comparisons were with a
decidedly Western bias.  The name change to ethnomusicology certainly
didn't erase Western bias but did help towards a more level playing field.

One of the principles to come out of ethnomusicology is the concept of
"emic" versus "etic."  Emic is the point of view of the "other" culture
and etic is the Western surmise of a foreign culture.

1200ET is an etic attempt to gague the unique distinctions of other
musics.  It is not always successful.  Non-pitched percussion music
certainly is inappropriate.  So is Tibetan music that is in constant
glissando.  Sapmi (Lapp) music -- or Joigenen -- intentionally avoids the
exact precise repetition of intervals in their non-texted vocal music.

As a scholar studying other music, emic data is vital to the understanding
of the musical concepts and materials of a foreign music.  This fact does
not negate the value of having a 1200ET "yardstick" to get closer to an
understanding of that music.  It certainly aids in the internalizing of
new interval for original compositions by us Westerners.
