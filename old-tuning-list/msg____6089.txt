   That's admirable.  Good luck with it.

   You might be well-served to see how your "product plans" compare with
Marion McCoskey's "FasTrack" JI MIDI sequencer, or possibly even Justonic's
"Pitch Palette" software.  I personally don't know much about the features
of either.



>Which is better: fine/course presets or pitchbends on tempered notes?

   First, I presume that by "tempered notes", you actually mean adjusted
notes.  That is to say that you're starting with a 12-tone equal-tempered
basis (in a sense inherent in MIDI) and making them UNtempered (JI).  (I'm
not trying to nitpick - I just want to make sure I know what you're
asking.)

   Assuming that that's what you're asking about, there has been a bit of
discussion about how to use pitch bend for microtonality.  The tricky part
clearly is how to synchronize it with note-ons under very legato playing.
Since the either the pitch-bend message must precede the note-on or the
reverse, you're going to have a "blurp" in pitch either at the attack of
the current note or at the release of the previous note.

   That is true provided that you play those notes on the same channel of
course.  One solution that has been proposed is to use a channel for each
of the nominal 12 notes per octave.  That has limitations of course, the
most obvious one being that if you want individual melody lines to be
rendered in a uniform instrumental timbre, then clearly you'll eat up 12 of
your available 16 for a single timbre.  You also have to figure out what to
do with the comparatively rare situation where you do a legato note-change
between two different pitches of nominally the same note (since they'll
land on the same channel).

   It is also more or less limited to tunings based upon a 12-toned
paradigm, but for many purposes, that's a very agreeable limitation.

   But pitch bend has been used successfully, if I recall correctly, by
John Starrett and Denny Genovese.  So you could perhaps consult with them.


   What do you mean by "fine/coarse presets"?
