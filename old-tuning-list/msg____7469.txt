Subject: Haverstick interview

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

A local news/arts rag, Westword, just did an interview with yours 
truly; the fellow who did it, Thomas Peake, did a very good job, and 
presented the ideas we discussed very well, for the most part (he said it 
was edited, and I got the feeling he liked the unedited version better). 
If anyone wants to check it out, go to www.westword.com, and click on 
arts and music...we have some writers in town who are into what we're 
doing, and are quite sympathetic...Hstick
