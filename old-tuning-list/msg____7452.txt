Does anyone out there have _personal_ experience with these modules?
Unfortunately, the great site maintained by John does not have the
details on the Korg X5DR, and it suggests that the Roland JV-1080 is
limited to 12-note scales.  I'm actually looking for a module that is
not limited to 12-note scales.  Thanks, Andrew Kaye
