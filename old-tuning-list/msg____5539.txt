Subject: intemperate music

From: "Collins, Gordon" <CollinG@f3groups3.fsd.jhuapl.edu>

To get back to the subject that I really wanted to bring up...

starting point):

While there has been a fairly strict intonational standard at most times and 
places, "somewhat flexible" here is a considerable understatement.  The 
distinction between n-limit JI, x-comma meantone, well-temperament, and 
12TET is *totally irrelevant* to the definition of modes and scales!

Look at a music theory book and its description of musical resources.  Where 
is there any discussion of pitch or tuning?  It just doesn't matter.  The 
only thing that rules out applying JI or meantone is the circle of fifths 
with its enharmonic equivalence of notes. 

It also is not sufficient to define "pitch areas" for the notes.  There are 
Renaissance motets in which, depending on one's interpretation of _musica 
ficta_ rules, the range of pitches used for F overlaps that used for E 
*within the same piece*.  This is not just due to comma shifts, but due to 
_ficta_ inflections.

But the notes of the modes were not taken from a larger set.  They WERE all 
the defined notes.  Others were *added* to the set as necessary for 
polyphony.  They were initially considered as intonational inflections, only 
later being accepted as separate notes in their own right as sharps and flats.

I agree with Daniel that modes and scales can only be defined in terms of 
whole tones and "half" tones, as a pattern of approximate intervals.  I don't 
think that those patterns can be described as pitches selected from a 
predefined tuning system.

In light of the above, the original modes would actually be:

7/7/0

Guido's system formally allowed for:

8/7/0

and the whole system with _musica ficta_ would be:

infinite/7/infinite

as there was no predefined set of available frequencies, and no upper limit 
on available auxiliary (_ficta_) pitches.


Reducing this to 12 requires accepting enharmonic equivalence, closing the 
circle of fifths.  That idea strikes me as one of the most pivotal notions in 
the history of Western music, yet as far as I can tell, it grew gradually 
over centuries and without much comment, only becoming fully accepted in the 
18th century.  Only then could 12TET, long understood, be applied.  It was 
far from being the foundation.
