From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I appreciate David Beardsley suggestion and will seek help to maybe do
just that. Although I found the Stockhausen thing a real pain. I really
think this might just work. By the way two stupid questions what does
BTW stand for and how is it that people answer things on the tuning list
before I even get the first comment!
