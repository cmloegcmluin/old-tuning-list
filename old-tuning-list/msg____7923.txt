Thanks for posting this Gary! Nice to see some details.  This is the 
same flute I mentioned a while back, but I still don't have a very 
detailed description of it, despite having written to the 
manufacturers.

However, I had a mail recently saying that they are stopping 
production because it doesn't sell.  : ( 

Did you hear anything along those lines?
