Subject: *Another* tuning special (more to come)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (Gregory Taylor)

I was thinking about what to do for the last RTQE program
before the 2-week seasonal fundraising drive, and decided
that the !12tET specials would be a strong selling point for
this portion of the year's programming. Accordingly, last
night was the third in the ongoing series. I'm realizing with
growing wonder just how much music this series is going to wind
up presenting - I've done absolutely *nothing* on microtonal and
non12tET musics from the non-western world. Also, the sequencing
has been such that I've *still* not played a note of H. Fortuin or
Gary Morrison or Beardsley or Other Music or John Catler. I think
that that means that there are *still* 2 full programs *at least*
yet to go.

One of my callers last night claimed that this work was starting
to sound "normal" to her now, which I'll take as a note of praise.
Someone also seems to have been looking at the Web page, since I
got a request for a bit more Tony Conrad.

The next of the tuning specials is now about 4 or 5 weeks off. This
means that any of the rest of you lurking fiends out there who would
like to submit some work for broadcast are still welcome to do so.
Drop me a line and we can talk about it.

With regards,
Gregory

RTQE 2/23/97 - !12tET Part 3 - More Adventures Beyond Equal Temperament

Having paid proper homage in the first program in the series (which
praised the trailblazers in our midst), we continue the work begun
with the second program - listening to the folks who work now outside
of the boundaries of the 12th root of 2. And guess what - we'll do it
again in about a month, with a fresh batch of new composers!
