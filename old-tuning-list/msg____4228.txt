Subject: Tonality?

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Where do tuning forum member stand with regard to the issue/idea/concept of
_tonality_? When I spoke to a group of JIN members in San Francisco some
years back, it was clear that the attraction of many members to JI was
specifically because of an interest in finding the best environment in
which to project _tonal_ musics. Likewise, many working with non-JI´s
analyse, describe, and use those tunings in largely _tonal_ terms.   

My own music is often tonally ambiguous - or locally tonal, but more
complex globally - and I find for analysis that the structures of JI are
the most useful maps of pitch relationships in _tonal_ music, even when the
intervals have been mapped onto a temperament (in which case, the JI
analysis may help to define the characteristics of the temperament
required). In any case, the reification of functional _tonality_ has never
been my central concern. I presume that I am in the minority, but would
like to be corrected if wrong.
