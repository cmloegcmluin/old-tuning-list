   I think that Steven is right here with three caveats:
1.  There are other musical markets than pop, not to suggest for a moment
that
    addressing the pop market isn't deadly critical.  For example, one
other 
    market I personally think also very valuable to pounce on is film
music.
2.  Within the pop market there's a 2-5% or so residual that would find
even 
    moderately subtle differences (like strictly diatonic music implemented
in
    19 compared to 12) curious-sounding.  A valuable strategy, I believe,
is
    to use the other 95-98% to bouy up a xenharmonic song's popularity so
that
    it can propagate to the attention of the target 2-5%.  Within other 
    markets, where subtlty is more of a way of life (like classical, jazz,
or 
    the assorted "artsy" forms) there is a much bigger % awareness. 
Obviously
    in the case of movie music the awareness would be mostly subconscious.
3.  It certainly is possible to make xenharmony very difficult to miss.  
    Microtonal chromatic runs (e.g., successive 34ths of an octave) make 
    unusual tunings a whole lot harder to miss than sticking with diatonic 
    melody.  For example, starting on a diatonically-credible leading tone
and
    then delaying resolution through several intermediate upward microtonal

    steps, will get a lot of peoples' attention!
