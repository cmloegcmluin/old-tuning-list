Subject: Re: La Monte Young on interval affect

From: monz@juno.com

I just ran across some stuff La Monte Young
said on interval affect, which relates to the
discussion in this forum over the last few days.
This is from an interview done by Ramon Pelinski
in 1978, and published in "Interval", vol. 4 no. 3.

> PELINSKI:  ...you wrote that the system of rational

> the relationship between sounds and feelings...[and]
> that from the infinity of possible tunings, you can
> choose the tuning that establishes the feelings you

> YOUNG:  Yes, I think it's very important here that

> when they read this, think that what I mean by feelings
> is happy, sad, amorous, angry, these types of feelings.
