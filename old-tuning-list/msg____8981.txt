   My immediate take would be that the two are not exactly synonymous, by=
 which
I mean "equidistant divisions of an octave" and "equal temperament", the
distinguishing case being nonoctave equal temperaments.  Carlos' Alpha, f=
or
example, would be an equal temperament, but no particular subdivision of =
the
octave.  Well, not an integer division anyway, and if not integer, then t=
hat
nomenclature becomes inconvenient.
