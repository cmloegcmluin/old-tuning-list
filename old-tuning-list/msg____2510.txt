Subject: RE:  Optomizing synthesizer tuning

From: Mmcky@aol.com

In order to optimize tuning you must know the tuning
characteristics of the target instrument.  This is a practical
impossibility with wavetable synthesis, since manufacturers's
won't release the specs.

However the specs for FM synthesis as implemented in the Sound
Blaster are readily available.  The output frequency in
proportional to a number written into a tuning register, and this
number can be any integer up to 1024.

With this information, it is relatively simple to determine
whether a JI scale can be exactly represented on the Sound
Blaster.  You just have to convert the scale to a multi-level
fraction.  To do that, just find the least common multiple of the
numerators of the fractions that make up the scale.  If that
number is less than or equal to 1/2 the highest integer you can
user to program the hardware, then your scale can be exactly
represented.  Otherwise it can't.  That procedure will work for
most systems using frequency linear tuning.  The notable
exception to this is the Amiga, which uses wavelength linear
tuning.  In that case you need to find the LCM of the
denominators of the fractions of your scales.

What Manuel suggested in his post was letting the fundamental of
the scale vary in order to maximize the tuning accuracy for the
whole scale.  That is also the basis of the technique discussed
above.

It is also possible to use this technique to find best fits for
scales that cannot be represented exactly.  For example, let's
find a couple of them for Agricola's Monochord posted on this
forum some time ago by John Chalmer's.

Agricola's Monochord

LCM:   2^14*3^7*5

 12       17496         243/       128
 11       16384          16/         9  Grave Minor Seventh
 10       15552          27/        16  Pyth Major Sixth
  9       14580         405/       256
  8       13824           3/         2  Perfect Fifth
  7       12960          45/        32  Augmented Fourth
  6       12288           4/         3  Perfect Fourth
  5       11664          81/        64  Pyth Major Third
  4       10935        1215/      1024
  3       10368           9/         8  Major Tone
  2        9720         135/       128
  1        9216           1/         1  Unison

The fundamental, 9216, factors into:  9216 = 2^10*3^2

It's easy to see from this that if we want to have the
fundamental be one of the notes represented exactly, we are
limited to numbers with factors of 2 and 3.  18 and 24 provide
some pretty good approximations, as show below.

                        18       24

       b    17496      972      729
      a#    16384 910.2222 682.6666
       a    15552      864      648
      g#    14580      810    607.5
       g    13824      768      576
      f#    12960      720      540
       f    12288 682.6666      512
       e    11664      648      486
      d#    10935    607.5  455.625
       d    10368      576      432
      c#     9720      540      405
       c     9216      512      384

Since all scales can be represented as collections of rational
fractions to any desired degree of accuracy, this technique is
theoretically extensible to all scales, although fractions with
numerators having large prime factors make it rapidly more
difficult.
