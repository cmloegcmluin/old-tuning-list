Gary, the author is referring to a phenomenon which I also have
experienced.  This comes about through rather intensive eye training with
solar light--not to be undertaken without guidance.  The rods and cones of
the eyes are sensitized to perceive beyond what I suppose could be called
the "normal" range.  Further discussin of this should be continued
privately.

Again the author is discussing what could perhaps be more accurately
termed "radiant" fields and energy--these are either more "electric" or
more "magnetic" in nature.  I am sure that we are at the very beginning of
our understanding of things electrical and magnetic; Newtonian physics
falls apart on the microscopic level and I believe Maxwell's Equations
will eventually suffer the same fate.

I realize it is too much to expect that anyone could make sense out of my
previous post taken out of context as it was.  Let me attempt to clarify
several of the "mystical" givens that form the basis of these thoughts and
then take this discussion off this list if necessary.

Even from the strictly "scientific" description I presume that all would
agree that as the earth evolved out of the sun, so we must see the sun as
the source also of life.  Mr. Savoy has proposed that energy, and therfore
matter also, has associated with it what he calls intelligence factors
(IF) and that it is these IF factors that are responsible for organizing
matter into forms which express life.  In fact solar radiant energy is by
far the most influential force on this planet.  Savoy proposes that eyes
evolved solely for the intake solar energy (intelligence)--Plato's
metaphor of the cave is apropo.  By absorbing solar energy in the proper
way, changes take place in many ways, from stimulating the rods and cones
to perceive a broader range of the electromagnetic spectrum to changes in
the endocrine system and resultant physiological changes.  As a result of
the IF factors of sunlight there is also a tremendous impact on the psyche
of the individual, which can be completely overwhelming (the devil made me
do it!). This radiant energy absorption is a kind of nourishment for the
organizing fields, or the intelligence that holds matter in particular
forms.  These fields reflect certain solar force centers and are linked to
particular organ systems of the body.  These fields can eventually "live"
independently of the physical body, achieving the potential for
"immortality".  Taoist techniques collect "chi" energy, circulating it
correctly to raise "shen", spirit, in the pursuit of
immortality--unfortunately I believe that the negative alchemical
presentation of taoist principles does a disservice to the true ideas,
like judging the efficacy of science based on its involvement in producing
the atomic bomb. 

But what does all this have to do with music?

I believe that this general thread of discussion of things "mystical" is
the result of several simple questions--as musicians, is there any reason
to work with one particular scale or another?  Does musical expression
have any particular effect on us, our bodies, psyches, spirits?
