   Well, then I recommend you avoid diatonic-triad nomenclature and
concepts (e.g., "V", "ii", or "vi") if you're not interested in diatonic
harmony!  

   Yes, you're certainly right that definitions don't make music;  they
make models for music.  How much heed a composer chooses to give to those
model structures is largely a different matter entirely.  

   It's easy for students and instructors, composers and performers to get
the impression, after writing their 629th SATB part-writing exercise, that
those annoying voice-leading rules from Freshman and Sophomore Theory
classes aren't meaningful to "real" music.  I really disagree.  Anybody who
feels that way needs to listen to Mozart's "Ave Verum Corpus", or the
"Agnus Dei" of his Requiem.  

   I'm certainly not suggesting by any means that that is the only valid or
useful mindset from which to write music.  But it's far from useless just
because it doesn't comprehend the idea of a comma.  

   The ideas of traditional harmony has value applied to certain microtonal
systems - as much or as little value as it has in 12TET.  Traditional
theory is based upon triadic harmony, but it's most basic emphasis is
functional harmony:  
* Leading tones want to go up, 
* Sevenths want to go down, 
* Dominant seventh chords want to resolve to tonic chords, etc.

   Functional harmony is also the basis behind wandering tonics:  If you
can convince an audience that some pitch is the leading tone, and you
resolve it upward by half-step, then they'll believe that the pitch you
land on is the tonic, even if it's not the tonic you started on.  Taken out
of the framework of functional harmony, and of tonality, the idea of
wandering tonics is no longer meaningful.  

   So it's certainly not unreasonable to think that the tonic could wander
down to the original pitch of the leading tone, for example.  But if it
does, it's still functionally the tonic, because that's how our ears will
perceive it.
