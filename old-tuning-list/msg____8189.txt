Subject: Wind-Instrument Design

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

Visiting my parents this past weekend, we did a little surfing, and
chanced upon this URL.  Some of you might also find it interesting:

                        http://www.mimf.com

While it's not directly tuning-related, it points to discussions, books,
and other resources related to building wind instruments.
