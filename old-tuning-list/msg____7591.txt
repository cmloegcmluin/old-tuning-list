Because of the digital circuitry involved, synthesizer manufacturers will be
inclined to select a number of steps per octave in which powers of 2 are a
majority.  Is there some mathematical reason that such numbers as 768, 864,
1024, 1152 and 1280 have poor consistency?  (I took these numbers, by the
way, from the video modes my computer's video card supports, but they are
typical of the kinds of numbers that come up time and again in connection
with digital circuitry.)

Is there a number that is mostly powers of 2 that would qualify as having
high consistency that would make the synth manufacturers happy?

Just my 2 bits worth,
Fred.
