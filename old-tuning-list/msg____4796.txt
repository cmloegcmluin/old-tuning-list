The story Matt describes is "Unaccompanied Sonata" by Orson Scott Card,
which is collected in the eponymous anthology, and probably other places
as well.  I would _not_ recommend skipping it, though; it is an
excellent story.

This isn't quite correct.  Actually, at first all that happens is that
one of his Listeners sneaks him a tape of Bach . . . and, afraid of
being discovered, he gives himself away when he stops experimenting with
fugue, and stops inventing new timbres for fear of reproducing a
harpsichord.  They just send him away from his home and his Instrument,
his life as a composer, after that.  The incident with the piano was his
second offense, and that's when they cut off his fingers.  His third
offense is . . . and then after _that_ . . .

Read the story.  It _is_ disturbing, but it's also one of the best
damned stories you'll ever read.
