It's clear that we're talking about two kinds of ''mistuned''. The first is
simply that Partch's instruments did  go out of tune relative to how he
wanted them - the idiophones and strings are weather sensitive, and he
didn't like to retune during intermission, so pitch would drift during a
concert. Some of the recordings give especially bitter examples of this.
What Adam was referring to, however, was Partch's use of pitches that were,
by his own terms, non-harmonic. One example frequently used by Partch areclusters on the chromelodeon, which could be analysed theoretically as
harmonics of incredibly low fundamentals, but were certainly not analysedin this way by Partch and are unlikely to be heard by in this way by anyone
else. (The use of the ''octave'' coupler on the chromelodeon should be
mentioned as well). Another example is the use of ''alternative'' playingtechniques yielding pitches which Partch did not bother to analyse. My
favorite examples are the playing of harmonic canons from the wrong side of
the bridge (in Windsong/Daphne) and playing slide string instruments withthe slide placed diagonally accoss the strings. Then there are instruments
- like the cloud chamber bowls - whose pitch is a more subjective matter.Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
