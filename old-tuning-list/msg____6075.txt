Subject: So Kind

From: Peter.Blasser@oberlin.edu

Thank you again John Chalmers.  I really did not expect so much of a kind
spirit.  I guess microtonal people are the coolest.
I think microtonality could have a very definite demand, if infused into
what is termed pop music.  I think that experimental high level
compositions are very intersting, but I am surprised that no one really
works with simple popular forms.
The Kithara that I am making has a 12 strings arranged lyre fashion, i.e.
spread apart over an open space, and one of its arms has the fretboard on
it.  This arm itself will have four or six strings.  Of course, the body
is modified from its original cradle kithara shape to a more assymetrical
form in order to attain the proper angles and sonority.  It looks more
like (I believe) a sumerian harp, with arms pointing assymetrically.  My
major problem is, on the fretboard portion, how could I have the strings
tuned to non-unison notes with close to harmoniai scales possible.  Since
a non-unison string  would imply a different AP for that string, i.e. a
16/13 string using a 13/13 utonality, the fretboard would have to be
modified somehow.
Currently, the two possibilities I have are as follows:
1)Angle the frets.  This would cause a serious "obliqueness" near the high
notes.
2)Use the 4/3, 3/2 system you described earlier.  This is actually pretty
appealing, as AP tetrachords would be available.  But, the scales if
played on multiple strings would not be pure KS harmoniai.
3)Cut the frets into little pieces.  I don't like this very much, just
because of the aesthetics.
Yeah, I'm doing Greek, and plan to be doing a harmoniai/tetrachord reading
of Sappho and Alcaeus with a nice complex rhythm and bass behind it.  See,
this is not traditional, and not really esoteric, because I think a drum
rhythm and funky bass would add what some pop people call "jive".  But, it
would still be microtonal.
THanks a lot.  Are there any college students or youngger in this group?
