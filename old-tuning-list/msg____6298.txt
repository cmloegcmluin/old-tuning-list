>thought you might like to know about the benefit
>concert i have organised for la monte young and
>marian zazeela. i don't know if you're aware, but
>marian has been quite ill recently & doctor's haven't
>yet made a satisfactory diagnosis. she spent about 60
>days incapacitated in bed with severe back pains and
>general numbness. this of course meant they were
>unable to continue with their work and made their

>feature special performances by pulp, spiritualized,
>gavin bryars ensemble and the english chamber orchestra
