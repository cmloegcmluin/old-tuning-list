1. Sure. All chords built on repeated intervals will have this character. 

2. I assume that you mean some kind of perceptual experiment. Short of an
EEG, all tests I can imagine involve some kind of identification or
labeling, which has a lot to do with training or conditioning - and the
phenomena here is already quite technical for trained musicians. So, with
trained musicians, I would suggest testing chords aside from Major or minor
triads, due to our overconditioning with these particular animals (although
some voicings of four-tone chords containing both Major and minor triads
also have this ambiguity: try 10:12:15:16).

One totally subjective example:

The triad:  330 - 440 - 495 (Hz). 

I hear it sometimes as /8 : /9 :  /12 and sometimes as 6 : 8 : 9. In
particular, if it is arpeggiated descending I tend to hear it as
subharmonic, ascending, harmonic. As a single gestalt, I flip-flop with a
slight preference towards the subharmonic interpretation - possibly because
of the smaller interval on top.

As for a test with untrained listeners, I have no idea of how to do it
without running into the problems of finding adjectives to characterize
chords.

Perhaps you can be more specific about what kind of experimental
information you seek.
