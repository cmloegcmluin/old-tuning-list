Subject: scary DSP system is right!

From: Rick Sanford <76122.2237@compuserve.com>

Hi Drew:

Can we find out:
1) how many of these systems there are in use today?
2) where the company is and how long they've been in business?
3) how large their capitalization is?

Or is this one of those 'new' companies?
