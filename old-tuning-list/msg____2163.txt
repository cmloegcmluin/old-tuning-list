Subject: Re: Diversity of Microtonal explorations

From: World Harmony Project <sejic@freenet.ufl.edu>

I feel that we are now in a position in time where it is possible for 
each of us to indulge in whatever musical specialty we may feel a passion 
for, without holding back the course of musical evolution in other 
realms. Ivor was indeed pressed for time. But thanks to his work, (and 
the internet) we
are now able to communicate with each other about a multitude of 
subjects, in as much detail as we choose. Each post from each person 
contributes to the whole from which each of us may glean whatever may be 
of value to us. Though I have been primarily interested in higher 
harmonics in the past, and now in an expanded version of Partch's 
tonality diamond, I find the discourse on other systems to be 
stimulating. The whole of knowledge is a better resource than any 
militant subset (at least for me). Specialized systems like 88cet might 
never be documented 
at all if it weren't for Garys enthusiasm. Marions exploration of the 
subharmonic series is profound. Even though Charles Lucie's ideas are 
hard to accept as the perfect system, I find his perspective fascinating. 
Now, Brian is challenging everything that comes before him, and 
presenting evidence for his objections. We all win! 
	Ivor was one of the most open minded people I ever met. He was 
allways in favor of exploration. He encouraged work in any new field, and 
applauded all developments, no matter how unusual they were. In his 
kinder moments, he even acknowledged 12 tet as useful for certain purposes.
I guess I'm rambling. But my point is: I'm glad to be in a position to 
communicate directly with such a diverse group of astute colleagues, and 
to have access to so much valuable information. 
	For those of you who think that I'm not being militant enough on the 
side of just intonation, I would like to point out something that Easly 
Blackwood once said: "There is no such thing as just intonation. All you 
can do is approximate a ratio by some standard of precision. It all 
depends on the tolorance that you are willing to accept". I think that the 
same thing could be said about equal temperaments, as well. This all 
comes to a head with David Canright's early work in which he showed that 
any equal tempered scale could be described as an array of just ratios 
when sufficiently high numbers are accepted in the ratios. 
	I find limits on just intonation components to be useful for 
compositional purposes as well as necessary for instrument construction, 
but I cannot imagine why I would ever say "No music should be made using 
intervals beyond the x limit". Unless I was concerned about the 
playability of that music by someone other than it's creator. But even 
that should not stop anyone from exploring the interest in their heart. 
	Go, Xenharmonikers!
