In many ways an important limitation!  In many ways an advantage.

Very true!

And they can be just!

Maybe it is!  The question would maybe be smoother if it contained a
suggestion...

Terms like "compound" and "secondary", as opposed to "primary", have already
been used to identify such cases.  See my post to Tunging Digest 1221 for a
brief discussion of this.

One thing is for sure:  Deciding how many of your limits are bounded, and
how far they are bounded is a real important choice!  Especially when you
get into the higher limits!  The JI Primer gives a good treatment of this --
besides Genesis of a Music, the only treatment that I know of.

[for escaping the diatonic hegemony, 22TET]

>may be our only hope.

I am on my knees!  You cannot believe this, Paul!  You just can't!  There
must be a million and one good ways to escape diatonic hegemony!  That they
might not meet the same criteria you use to make 22TET good does not
dis-qualify them!

MHO, with nothing against your criteria for 22TET.

No wonder, considering the number of times more information that can be
stored in the 7-limit than in any root of 2 temperament with up to 2 times
the number of pitches.

I'm not sure JI tunings do more for me than all the others put together
(since no implimentaions of strong JI exist to my knowledge), but at least I
can't say they don't do SOMETHING!

Ridiculous.  Your vocabulary will reach the limet of perception before any
intervals will.

I suggest that your usage of the term "melody" is very un-good.  But I've
got a comparo for you anyhow...

1. Play a melody using 100 cent steps.
2. Play a melody using 88 cent steps.
3. Not a bigger difference to be found.

1. Who cares?
2. How do you know?

1. Music that innovates what?
2. Your analogy depends on a relationship between sound and words that
doesn't exist.

I was a melody freak once... I think I know where you're coming from.
Believe me, what you call melody is an arbitrary and limiting thing.  When
you give it up, what you call the best melodies will pop out of the sink in
the morning.
