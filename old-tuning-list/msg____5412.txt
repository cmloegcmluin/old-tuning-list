G'day,

I have a student who has a keen interest in just intonation tunings. For
starters I thought it would be useful for her to hear the JI intervals
used in various ancient Greek tunings described in Barbour. I created 
Csound files with pitch information generated using Scala. Others are now
getting interested. 

In order to cope with more of this and do it effectively, I have started
learning to write Scala command files that allow a novice to generate
Csound .SCO and .ORC files and try out these tunings.

At the Conservatorium, Csound has been set up and working well for some
time in Windows with 4 icons which do specific tasks by running DOS batch
files which
	[1] edit score files, [2] edit orchestra files 
	[3] make wave files & [4] play wave files. 
Scala has now been added in the same way. 

Currently, I know how to write Scala command files which write .ORC files
completely using ECHO to generate the appropriate text strings.  However,
I've had to generate .SCO files in a way which ends up with pitch
information in a format that requires further editing. This takes away the
immediacy and introduces the potential for typing errors. 

I've attached the code I have produced so far for doing this. I'd like to
know if there is an elegant way in Scala to strip strings out of the
tables generated by commands like SHOW/FREQUENCY. That way I can set up
Scala where a novice user can easily try out hundreds of JI tunings by
clicking on three icons
	
	[1] starts scala (user invokes @filename.cmd & creates 
	    a scale as two csound files by entering the ratios)
	[2] makes a wave file & 
	[3] plays it. 

If someone can suggest a way to do this or knows of someone who has
already done it, I'd like to know.

BTW, if anyone is interested in the DOS scripts for edit & make, is there
a site where these could be left ?

Greg S
