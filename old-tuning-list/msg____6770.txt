Subject: The Intonational Preferences of Irish Setters

From: Steven  Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov>

With all the judgement being passed on music unheard, based solely on
the materials chosen for a mere *one* of its many organizing
principles, and all the howling being done, about sour tunings causing
ear damage to canines, I thought I'd conduct a little research:

I asked my dog what he thought of the various tunings I've been
playing with.

Now, he couldn't, of course, answer me with numbers, and theroretical
discussions about the canine melodic lemondrop, and I don't have the
equipment necessary to pitch analize *his* singing [the tail is
definately in 2/2 time :)] but, judging by his habit of sleeping next
to me while I'm practicing, and the contented look on his face, I feel
fairly confident that he really doesn't care one bit what tuning I
happen to be using.  He's quite happy to know that I am finding some
fulfillment in my attempts at self expression.  I'm making music,
which makes me happy, which makes him happy, and the world is richer
all around.  What more need he say?

It makes me wonder whether good ol' Boo has something to teach the
human population?

That being said...

I sincerely wish everyone on the list a happy, peaceful and musical
holiday... however you tune it. ;-)


Steve
