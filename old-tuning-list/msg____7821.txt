I'll be a digest out of date by the time I send this.
Anyway, there are some things I want to say and I'll say
them all in one message.  Apologies if I seem to be repeating
or ignoring someone.


LATTICES

It would be more correct to say "Paul Erlich's Triangular
Lattice Diagram, which is of the type used by Breed".  Paul
was using them before me, definitely extended them to the
7-limit first, and drew them in ASCII first.  He also named
them "triangular".  As I say on my website (and have said
before on this list) _I_ would have called them hexagonal,
like I was taught in Condensed Matter Physics.

I don't know how much, if anything, is original to Paul.
He can speak for himself on that.

We can, of course, work with as many dimensions as we like
by using coordinate geometry.  It is easer to "understand"
scales when you can visualise them, though.  You can specify
ambiguous chords as a superposition of different matrices.
I think this has application in a dynamic tuning program.

Usually, I connect all 5-limit planes in this fashion.  I
don't usually do that with three planes in a diagram, because
it gets too cluttered with lines.  If I were to, it would
look something like this:


                  B-----------F#
                 / \         / \
                /   \   Ab  /   \
               /     \ / \ /     \
              /   E#----------B#  \
             /     \ / \ / \ /     \
            G-------\---D---/-------A
             \     / \ / \ / \     /
              \   Fb--\---/---Cb  /
               \     / \ / \     /
                \   /   G#  \   /
                 \ /         \ /
                  Bb----------F

>From the way the lines cross, you can see which plane is

dimensions in your mind.  Ideally, each plane would be a
different colour.  The structure is a regular dodecahedron,
or something like that.

I find it easier to understand the scales with conventional
names.  There's no need for prime factorisation, because it's
implied by the lattice.


PRIME VS ODD LIMIT
------------------

The most paradoxical chord from an odd limit perspective I
find is 4:6:9.  I think of it as extended 3-limit, because
it's the fifths that give it it's character.  It is also
highly octave specific.  It sounds more consonant
(concordant) than a major triad in root position, but
transpose it to 8:9:12 and it's clearly more dissonant.

There may be ways the ear relates to prime factors.  Different
overtones will be reinforced, and the difference tone pattern
may change.  This is strongly linked to timbre, though, and
breaks down before you get to 81/64.

The good intervals in equal temperaments don't usually
constitute anything like an odd limit.  It's generally more
efficient to say how well different primes are approximated.
For exactness, state the signed errors, and you can work
other intervals out from that.

Incidentally, it seems to me that the concept of level-n
consistency is closely related to the recently defined
radius of the scale.  If you want to use all the notes in
a radius 2 scale, it helps if it's level-2 consistent as well.


OCTAVE INVARIANCE
-----------------

There are (at least) three different concepts involved here,
which need to be distinguished for the discussion to progress:

1) The idea that harmony is unchanged if notes are transposed
  independently in octaves.

2) The practice of giving notes related by octaves the same name.

3) The practice of defining scales within an octave, and
  repeating them in other octaves.

In all cases the choice of the octave as an invariant interval
is not an arbitrary one.  (1) I would argue with, if taken as a
fundamental principle.  I won't do so in detail today, as it is
outside the brief of this list (we all now how to tune octaves!)

If the ear/brain complex has a hard-wired mechanism for
octave reduction, this would relate to the 10:12:15 vs
16:19:24 tuning of a minor triad.

Personally, I see no way in which intervals an octave apart
can be considered "the same" and my brother agrees with me.
I'm sure people can convince themselves otherwise, the same
way they learn to hear the "3-ness" in a sharp major third.


TEMPERAMENT
-----------

Then again, perhaps Schoenberg had a piano.

Where were you when Gregg Gibson was stomping all over the
list?  Temperaments do make modulation easier, and this is
important.  If this is a personal decision, though, it's fair
enough.

That sounds too dogmatic to me, perhaps it wasn't intended
to be.  Other reasons are:

1) You like the sound of it.

  The only reason you need.

2) It simplifies notation.

  If a piece of music makes sense in JI, good musicians will
  work this out from staff notation, if you point out the
  difference between G# and Ab.  (If there are a lot of
  Pythagorean intervals, Erv Wilson's positive notation is more
  useful.)  Bad musicians won't be helped by precise tuning
  indications.  If the music doesn't make sense, who cares
  how it's played?

3) It allows ambiguous chords.

  I remember you (Monzo, TD1403) agreeing that the chord
  below only works in meantone.  Did you really mean to imply
  (above) that this isn't a use for temperament?

                 A---E---B
                      \ / \
                       G---D---A

4) You can't be bothered to work out the ratios.

  As implied in the Schoenberg paragraph, most
  composers don't want to worry about ratios.  They want a
  resourceful scale to compose in.  Give them a meantone, and
  they'll find good harmonies in it.  They might even give
  them to musicians who'll render them in JI.  Do you really
  expect the composer to sit and work out where the commas
  should be?


POPULAR MUSIC

Cool!  I've got one TGU album (Psychic Karaoke) and I've
always wondered if it's strictly 12-equal.  There's no mention
of a Tim in the booklet, though.  Alex Kasiek and Hamid Mantu
are both credited, among other things, with "Keyboards".

> Could this be one of those General Music "Arabian" keyboards ?

Unlikely, I'd have thought.  Perhaps they just mean a tunable
synth.  There's seem's to be more of an Indian than Arabic
influence in TGU, along with the dance, rap and reggae.  There
are Indian Classical vocals on one track.

When I was looking for a MIDI keyboard, one of the shops I
went to said, after I asked about tuning capability, that
there'd been some Arabs in before after the same thing.  I
think they use normal synths with tuning tables.

Technically, it was someone in the shop who said that, rather
than the shop itself.  Anyway, you get the idea.

Also, there's an "Eno" credited on this TGU album.  Probably
Brian, although could be Roger.  I think Brian was mentioned
before as having used microtonality, wasn't he?  Maybe there's
a connection.


BTW, anyone familiar with Nassim Maalouf?

The most irrational meantone in this respect is Kornerup's
phi based tuning.  Is that right?  I think of it as the
standard melodic meantone.


GUITAR TUNING
-------------

This is pitch shifting, presumably?  It's something I had in
mind when I went for a non-equal fretting.  Unfortunately,
my Zoom 505 isn't good enough to be useful in this respect.
Actually, modulation hasn't been a problem so far, as it's
common to use keys with open strings anyway.  The solution
would be to tune the strings around the set of keys desired.

Incidentally, having different notes on different strings is
a _good_ thing.  It means you get more chords than you would
otherwise.


John Starrett:

Fretting a note will slightly lengthen the string, and so
increase it's tension.  I worked out that, to a first order
approximation, this effect is independent of where on the
fingerboard you put your finger.  So, move the nut a bit
nearer the bridge than if it were the zeroth fret.

Independently movable bridges probably work for this reason,
except they're at the wrong end of the guitar!

For a guitar's tuning to be good enough to make just intonation
relevant, we do have to think about this sort of thing.  The
tuning pegs are the most imprecise bit according to my ST900.
Good enough for meantone, but no better.  Also, the thickest
string varies about 10 cents depending on how hard I pluck it.
