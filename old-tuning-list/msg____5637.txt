   The 88CET system I keep droning on and on about is such a system, as is
Carlos' Alpha.  88CET has 8 steps per P5, and Alpha has 9 per P5.  Bohlen's
13ET per P12 tuning obviously concentrates on twelfths instead.

   At least when it comes to 88CET, I found value in considering stacks of
fifths wrapping within a 7:4, since those are two useful and very clearly
recognizable building blocks.  Similarly, I found stacks of 9:7 supramajor,
and 11:9 neutral, thirds to form useful chord or chord-fragment building
blocks.

   Or to put it another way, I have found stacks of many intervals to have
both harmonic and melodic meaning, whether or not we wrap them within an
octave or other interval, and regardless of what root pitch you build them
upon.
