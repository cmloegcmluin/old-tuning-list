Subject: Randy WInchester's remarkable 
 collection of microtonal compositions
--
Some months ago one of the forum subscribers
sent me a remarkable tape.  It contained 
compositions in every equal temperament
from 7 through 23 tones per octave, except
for 18 and 16.
This collection of compositions seems to me
one of the best such collections ever done.
It's outstanding.
What makes the collection even more noteworthy
is the fact that it was done on an "obsolete"
analog synthesizer.  Oddly enough, this gives
the recordings a certain sonic sheen not present
in sequaky-clean digital timbres.  
Overall, Randy's collection is remarkable and
I've listened to it more than half a dozen times.
Other forum subscribers (to whom I've sent
copies with Randy's permission) agree.
If there's any justifce in the world, Randy's
collection will be issued on commercial
CD or cassette.
For my mney, it's right up there with Easley 
Blackwood's and Ivor Darreg's collections.
