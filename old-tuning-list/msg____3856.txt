Subject: RE: Jon Catler's guitar, Microstock 2

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

I just received the Catler Bros. new CD in the mail. There don't seem to be 
nearly enough frets on J.C.'s guitar to make 49/oct -- is it that if all the 
notes were transposed to one octave, there'd be 49?

Sorry the event wasn't more popular -- I hope to be contributing my own 
22-tone jazz/rock in some future Microstock. While Neil's tunings are the 
best ETs for 5-limit harmony, and Catler favors purely tuned 13-limit 
sounds, my own preference falls somewhere in between, with 7-limit harmony 
predominating and excursions up to the 11-limit. Although I won't deny their 
musical usefulness, 13-limit sounds have yet to impress me as "consonant" in 
the slightest. Right now I'm still fumbling with a keyboard, barely able to 
reach a "perfect fifth" with one hand, can't wait for the guitar to arrive .
