Subject: Terry Riley Wkshp.

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

I just hear that Terry Riley will be giving a series of North Indian Raga
workshops in Santa Cruz, California.  I think they are @ UCSC.  I think
they are also free.  I do not know if they are public, or what, but if
they are, I highly recommend going. The style of vocal music that he will
be teaching is all purely intoned.  If you haven't had exposure to it, it
is an excellent way to experience the qualities of such tuning when
performed with the human voice.  Terry is an excellent teacher, and even
if you don't have much interest in indian music, you will probably learn
some very fundamental things about music in general if you attend.

If I weren't finishing school right now I'd fly down to CA also.


passing the word,
