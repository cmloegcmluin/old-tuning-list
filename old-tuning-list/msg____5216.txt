Well, I think Jonathan Walker's misunderstanding of the limit concept points 
out that understanding the prime limit concept does not guarantee that the 
word "odd" will be enough to get Partch's limit concept across. A 12-note 
Pythagorean tuning will involve odd numbers as high as 177147 (this apperas 
in the ratio of the wolf), but the music itself may never go past the 
3-identity, or, especially if schismatic approximations are used, the 
5-identity (as in the middle and late Medieval periods, respectively).

By the way, this is not a question of adopting a new term, it is a question 
of preserving the terminology introduced by Harry Partch in light of 
separate developments that have stolen the word "limit."

By the other way, my roommates this summer had studied electronic music at 
Harvard using Allen Strange's textbook. They wanted me to tell him that they 
loved his book! They're doing a lot of techno music, which favors vintage 
analog synths just like rock&roll favors vintage guitars.
