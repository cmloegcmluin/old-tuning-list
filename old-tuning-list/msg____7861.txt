[Schoenberg, 1934 letter to Joseph Yasser, (Yasser's
 translation), quoted by Daniel Wolf in TD 1386:]
> ''...indeed whenever I have had occasion to take up
> intonation with string players, I have always insisted
> on its _tempered_  form.(...)

[Monzo:]
Ben Johnston told me once of an anecdote related by
Peter Yates.  Yates was present at a rehearsal of
a Schoenberg string quartet, supervised by the composer.
Yates said that Schoenberg had a piano present, had
it scrupulously tuned to 12-eq, and insisted that the
strings rehearse exactly in tune with it to get the intonation
he desired in his quartet.
