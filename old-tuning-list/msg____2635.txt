On a recent visit to New York, I arranged to meet Dean at SUNY Purchase 
while school was not in session.  He was very hospitable, and showed me 
around the instruments, pointing out the alterations and comparing the 
originals with some new copies made, namely a couple of harmonic canons 
and surrogate kitharas, and a "new" chromelodeon.  They are indeed as 
beautiful as in the pictures, but show some age and wear.  I was allowed 
to play a bit and also see two of Dean's fantastic instruments.

Not all of the instruments are there, though.  Quadrangularis Reversum 
and Eucal Blossom are in the Public Library in New York, as John wrote, 
but I'm not sure where the other copy of Kithara I is.  Only one Boo is 
standing, and the bamboo pipes were replaced with resinated plastic by 
Chris Forrster (for good or for bad, depending on who you ask).  The 
other Boo is disassembled, for lack of space.  This might also be the 
reason for the Quad. Rev. being on display.

The instruments are not "on display", but rather "in residence" at SUNY 
Purchase, where I assume Newband rehearses all the time.  New pieces are 
also being written for Partch instruments in combination with others, 
including a great piece by Drummond for zoomoozophone, flute, harmonic 
canon,and perhaps a couple of others instruments (I forget).  Newband has 
also asked Julia Wolfe (may favorite!) to write a piece which includes 
Partch instruments as well.

He also commented that Newband will attempt to learn the entire Partch 
repertory and record each piece digitally for commercial release.
