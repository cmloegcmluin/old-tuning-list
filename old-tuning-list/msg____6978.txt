From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@tiac.net>

I guess I should add my instruments to the list, incase anyone is keeping
statistics and extrapolating from them.

Ne electronic instruments. I keep my Steinway in equal temperament. The
organ at church is tuned to equal, at 68 degrees Farenheit; my practice
time in the winyter is usually at closer to 55 degrees, so when I use the
reed stops, the beat presence is alarming/astounding. Harpsichords at home
and church. Clavichords: unfretted, double fretted usually to mean-tone,
triple fretted usually at Kirnberger II. (changing tuning on fretted
clavichords isn't the work of a spare 10 minutes).

Recorders by Alec Loretto and Rob Turner made as replicas of Renaissance
and 17th century instruments, which can handle any temperament. Cornetto
by John McCann which picks its own temperamints and with which I have many
heated disagreements. Sackbutt which will play anything.
