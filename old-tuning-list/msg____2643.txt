[This post didn't seem to make it the first time, so I'll try again.]

In the course of my various xenharmonic researches, I've come across numerous
bibliographic references to articles in Interval.  I have been unsuccessful
thus far in locating this periodical.  I am fairly certain that it is no longer
published.  Can anyone offer information about obtaining back issues for this
publication?
