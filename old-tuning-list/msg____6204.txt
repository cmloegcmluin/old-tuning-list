From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

I thought that 12ET was tempered 5-limit JI.  How then can one claim the
grid is exclusively 12ET in pop?  I don't hear it that way and neither do
many of the players I come in contact with.  I believe the globalization
of tunings deemphasizes any single system, no matter how imperious.

If a microtone is smaller than a semitone exclusively, then the other
larger microtones (e.g. 7/4) would seem to be of a different pedigree.
Would they be mere extrapolations of "smaller-than-semitone" deviations of
12ET?  Only by considering all pitch concocted intervallic relationships
as on the same page can one apprehend evenhandedly.

Truly I play just 5/4 thirds in tunes of Pink Floyd's _the final cut_ in
semi-frequent bassoon jams.  Mayhaps microtonal intervals are a more
important barometer of pop microtonal useage than the wholesale adoption
of a radically distinct tuning system.  There has never been much in the
way of fully harmony in pop and that is part of its charm.  But their are
a myriad of intended microtonal intervals out there.
