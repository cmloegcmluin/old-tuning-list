Planets and moons tend to have simple harmonic periods and distances
because of orbital resonance, a well-understood phenomenon caused by
gravity.

Death is not particularly mysterious.  Death is not a force; it is a
phenomenon which occurs when a living being sustains too much damage,
though any of countless possible causes, to continue living and becomes,
like the vast majority of matter in the universe, unliving.

(Life, I'll grant you, is rather mysterious, although we've been
learning about it for eons and have learned a respectable amount by now.
Death, however, is simple.)

As for the specific question "Where is Carl Sagan?", well, where is the
Soviet Union?  Where is the flame after you snuff a candle?  They're not
there anymore.  The individual components that made them up may still be
there, but the sustained, organized collection of processes to which we
shorthandedly refer as "the Soviet Union" or "a candle flame" or "Carl
Sagan" are gone.  This is only mysterious if one subscribes to the
misguided notion that conservation laws apply to epiphenomena.  Sorry,
Charlie; 'tain't so.

Now, if anyone intends to convince me of the psychoacoustical
significance of any phenomenon in the future, please come prepared with
something more than "look, simple harmonic ratios!"  Lots of things have
simple harmonic relationships, for multitudinous reasons.  Doesn't
automatically mean we can hear them.
