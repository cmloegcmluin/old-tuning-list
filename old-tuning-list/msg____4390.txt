Subject: Indian Music

From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

In reply to Daniel Wolf:

>It has long been surprising that an electronic microtonal keyboard has not
been commercially produced in India or Pakistan. It seems like a product
that would have a great domestic demand as well as a potential for
profitable export to niche markets abroad (like American microtonalists!).
Maybe some list members have concrete ideas. Perhaps a 12 (Pyth)+10 (comma
varied) keyboard with a variable fundamental frequency would be sufficient.
 
I think I remember seeing an electronic microtonal keyboard used in
Middle Eastern music as far back as the 70's, but I don't remember
any details about it.  I never checked on what kind it was or where
it was made, but it saw it in performances in Los Angeles.

In reply to Neil's reply to Kami:

>Haverstick here...Kami's post on Indian systems fits exactly with a
book I've been reading by Alain Danielou, "Music and the Power of
Sound"...

I haven't had a chance to look at this book, but I have seen one of
Danielou's previous books, "Northern Indian Music."  This has a
number of ragas in it, and Danielou's notation system for their
tuning as he believes ithem to be.  (It's controversial and I've
had serious discussions with ethnomusicalologists about it, as many
follow Jharaizbhoy's claim that real musicians don't play in
just nintonation or Pythagoriean tuning, as Danielou claims.)  Anyway,
you can figure out the ragioshhtios for the ragas by matching a key at
the beginning of the book with Danielou's notation for teh tuhe tunings.
I prepared some charts about that and included them in my 
dissertation, which is supposedly available from University 
Microfilms, though I never received the copies that I ordered from
them.  ("Exploring Microtonal Tuinnings:  A Kaleidoscope of Extended
Just Tuinnings and Their Compositional Applications.)")

Anyway, whether or not Danielou (who isn't Indian) "gfoot it right" or
not, his tunings are very gbbeautiful and they sound reasonably "Indian"
to me.  Real artists don't just play tunings, though, they add a 
lot of "gamakas" which are different kind s of ornaments, with
sliding around a pitch.  I would doubt that many singers are as
accurate as computers., but teh Che CD I just listened to by Lakshmi
is pretty awesome.  ("Les Heures et les Saisons"  Harmonia Mundi,
France, 1987, 1989)

Okay, got to finish packing now.  We leave for a holiday in the
States in the morning, so don't expect any replies to your relies
to this message.

Best,

Lydia Ayers
