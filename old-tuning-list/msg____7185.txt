Subject: Re: Microtones in Pop

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

To continue an earlier thread that takes on more import, pick up the
recent issue of Guitar World with its part II interview with 
Eddie Van Halen by Vic Garbarini.  Van Halen focuses on his new tunings
used on his upcoming release Van Halen III.

How'd I find out about the interview?  The journalist called me 2 weeks
ago, before it was published.  Van Halen has retuned for every tune on the
album (keyboard) so as to achieve just harmonies and is now interested in
well-temperament.  Other rockers were mentioned on that phone call as
having primary interest in tuning alternatives.

BTW, Sting's Roxanne has a very clear descending 11/8 on the chorus for
the word: Roxanne.

Yep, it's happening.  Open your ears and hear all the microtonal activity
in Rock and other pop forms.
