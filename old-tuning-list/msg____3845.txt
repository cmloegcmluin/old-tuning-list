As I recall, and I'm quoting this from a friend who owns a K2500, the
limitations are:
1.  You can tune "any" equal-temperament across all keys linearly (that is some
    completely consistent number of cents between each adjacent key up the 
    keyboard).  The problem is that you only can do that to 2-cent resolution.
    Quartertones (50 cents per step) therefore work fine, but 19TET (approx.
    63.16 cents per step) doesn't.
2.  You can retune the notes of the keyboard to arbitrary pitches with a key-
    map.  The problem is that you're limited to 12-tone-per-octave tunings.  
    Again 19TET in the frequently-used "linear" mapping of 63.16 cents between
    adjacent key is not possible.  That limitation does make it possible to 
    map it into two-or-more 12-toned subsets, like I did in my EPS Xenharmonic
    Scales Disk (one with naturals and flats, one with naturals and sharps, and
    a third with the most common accidentals (e.g., F# instead of Gb, and Bb
    instead of A#) along with E#/Fb and B#/Cb).  I don't know if the K2x00 
    provides any means like the EPS/ASR's patch-select buttons of 
    interactively switching between tuning tables though.

   The rather cumbersome solution is to turn each key into its own individual
sample playback, and adjust the pitch of each accordingly.  There is apparently
a program that helps you do that.  

   But again, I'm not knocking Kurzweil or the 2x00.  I'm just repeating what a
friend who owns one has told me.
