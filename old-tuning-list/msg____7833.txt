It came from Ben Johnston, "Scalar Order as a Compositional
Resource", published in _Perspectives of New Music_, vol 2 # 2,
Spring-Summer 1964, p. 59:

[Johnston:]
"...Octaves are then divided by a scale of smaller intervals.  The
two conflicting criteria which condition this are simplicity and
symmetry: that is, a preference for simplicity or consonance of
harmonic pitch ratios, and a preference for dividing melodic
intervals symmetrically, into "equal" smaller intervals.

"Melodically, the pitch dimension is a linear succession of
octaves, each internally subdivided into smaller intervals which
we speak of adding and subtracting.  But this view of pitch offers
no explanation of the common harmonic experience of a gradual
scale of consonance and dissonance.  Listening harmonically to
pitch intervals we are actually comparing tempos of vibration...
<snip>

"Harmonic listening is too easy and too basic to be ignored, even
in purely melodic music.  Yet melodic preference for equal scale
intervals is also strong.  If a scale is derived harmonically, it
must consist of intervals whose melodic sizes differ by what seems
a negligible amount.  What seems negligible depends mostly upon
relative sizes but also upon cultural conditioning and upon "how
good an ear" an individual listener has." [end quote]

Johnston then proceeds to demonstrate how he derived a
53-pitch-class 5-limit JI source scale with an approximately
equal division of the octave.  Compare the following:

Interval		Prime factors	Ratio		Cents
--------		-------------	-----		-----
Syntonic Comma		3^4 * 5^-1	81/80		21.5
53-eq "step" size	2^(1/53)	n/a		22.6
Pythagorean Comma	3^12		531441/524288	23.5

The fact that the 53-eq step size is almost exactly midway
between the two commas means that 53-eq is good at approximating
all the notes in a 5-limit system (that is, ratios with factors
of 3 and 5), or, conversely in Johnston's case, that a 53-tone
5-limit system that divides the octave as evenly as possible will
approximate 53-eq very closely.

This article is a very lucid exposition of the matter stated in
the title.  Johnston describes S. S. Stevens's "four kinds of
scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio".
He gives examples of musical use of the four as follows:

nominal		formal analysis (ABA, ABACABA, etc.)
ordinal		dynamics (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff)
interval	melodic use of pitch (i.e. ET)
ratios		harmonic use of pitch & tuning by ear

Johnston's writings get very little citation -- they're well worth
reading.
