Subject: Metaphysics and music

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Because I am staying at my mother's home in Rancho Santa Fe,
I've been bombarded with news reports of the mass suicide
a few miles away. I've not failed to notice the musical symbolism 
associated with the cult. Ti and Do are plausibly solfe'ge syllables 
and the names used by some members ending in -ody are probably coined 
in imitation of melody, rhapsody, etc. where the -ody element from a 
Greek word for song. I can't say whether there is further significance 
to Ti and Do related to their scalar roles as leading tone and tonic.
All of this is consistent with Applewhite having been a music teacher
in Houston, TX in the late 60's and early 70's, before my arrival
there from NJ.

Anyway, I hope this sad incident serves to caution all of us not 
to take metaphysics, musical or otherwise, too far.

On that note (NPI), I've collected some more information about 
critics of Gauquelin's "astrobiology" and am having a friend in
Seattle enquire about an alleged Department of Paraphysics and 
Parapsychology at the University of Washington i and will forward 
it off-list to the interested parties. I agree with Brian Belet that
metaphysics, however interesting, is off-topic for this list.
