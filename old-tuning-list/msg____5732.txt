Subject: Re: the 6th chord and odd-limit theory

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

I've got this almost completely sorted out now, and I don't even
need matrices to explain it.  If I'm repeating anyone here, it's
because I thought a different approach would be helpful.  I'm not
behind on the list or anything like that.

All the numbers we'll be meeting today will be odd, so I won't say
so every time.  Numbers with more than one prime factor have a
special significance, so I'll call them "rhubarb numbers" for want
of knowing a better term.

First choose a number m.  Either n or m, or both, must be
composite. m<n.  n and m  must not share a common factor.
Providing neither m nor m are rhubarb, a saturated n-limit chord
can be constructed form all the divisors of n*m except n*m and 1.
This chord will be it's own utonal analog.

Examples are the two 9-limit saturated chords already found.
Also, the 11-limit s-chord 33:11:9:3, the 25-limit s-chord
75:45:25:15:9:5:3 and the 35-limit s-chord
105:63:45:35:21:15:9:7:5:3.

When mj is rhubarb, we have a problem.  The intervals n*i/j and
n*j/i will be beyond the n-limit.  The same problem occurs when
nj is rhubarb unless i>m and j>m, so that i*m<n and j*m<n.
This problem complicates matters, but is not insuperable as I
shall demonstrate with the example n, m

This gives us the chord 35:21:15:7:5:3.  The intervals 35/3 and
21/5 are >15-limit.  Therefore [21 or 5] and [35 or 3] must be
removed.  If 35 and 21 are removed, we have a 15-limit otonality.
Removing 5 and 3 gives its utonal analog.  The choice is then
removing [21 and 3] or [35 and 5].  The resulting chords 15-limit
s-chords 35:15:7:5 and 21:15:7:3 are then otonal/utonal analogs.

I otonal/utonal pairs will arise whenever the rhubarb prooblem
occurs.  I haven't looked at any cases where n and m are both
rhubarb.  The first of these is n5, m3.  Doubly rhubarb
numbers can safely be ignored until someone starts writing 105-
limit music.

That should be all you need to know.
