I bought my first lap steel in a pawn shop and tuned it JI to A C# E G# B E.
Steel is naturally a microtonal instrument, so I've spent the last 25 years
learning to play it "in tune" with 12TET bands.  I still tune my non-pedal
instruments JI, but I've gone to meantone on my pedal steels.

I think that the steel guitar is the best microtonal instrument "out of the
box".  Nearly every other instrument has to be custom made or modified.
Steel, like the violin, is microtonal by nature, but goes beyond the bowed
string family with its chord capabilities.

I was working up "Remington Ride" with the band the other night and noticed
that there's a quarter tone (actually, it's probably an 11/9) in the melody.
I tried to use it to discourage the fiddler and the guitarist from playing
bad harmony lines with me (EVERYONE wants to twin the steel on that tune).
No such luck - the fiddler found some harmony note right away, and the
guitarist did a horrible string bend that he thought worked pretty good.
This band needs a dictator!
