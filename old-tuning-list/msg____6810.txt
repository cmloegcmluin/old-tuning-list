From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Perhaps, this would be a good time to share with the list some of your
credentials.  Are you a professional performer?  Are you a composer with
music to share?  Are you a teacher?  So many of my experiences with the
above have put me at variance with your conclusions.  Filling us all in on
your background will serve to improve communication.

As for Joel's originality -- I think you are misdiagnosing his theory
dissertation with examples.  It is as a composer that one is absolutely
original and Joel is a composer.  His style is certainly less virtuosic
than mine, but he has an enthusiastic following.  Have you heard any of
his music?  It is not readily available.

As a result of Joel's success (are y'all aware that Joel has been a
founding board member of the AFMM?) we are presenting the work again as
part of joint collaboration between the AFMM and C.W. Post College on
March 5th.
