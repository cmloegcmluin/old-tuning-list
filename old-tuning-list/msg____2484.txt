Subject: Re: So you want to be a microtonal composer?

From: puzan@pe.net (Matthew Puzan)

Thanks for all of your rather warm responses to my thoughts on microtonal
research. I have either scanned or thoroughly studied (or somewhere in
between) all of the material that you suggest and found them all quite
influential in forming my present opinions. Fokker, Vyshnegradski, et al,
were only excluded from my thesis for the simple fact that projects, like
human beings, must have limits. The paper was written with the foresight
that I might, someday, have the opportunity to teach a course (or a section
of a course) in methods of composition in extended tonalities and would be
able use it for that purpose. Many of you have probably already read, first
hand, all of the source material that went into the project and would glean
little, if any, "new" information from it. However, it is not completely
without merit to make comparisons of epitomized theories viewed in close
proximity. So from that point of view you might find it at least amusing. I
am hoping to publish segments of it at some point in the future, so you
might see it pop up somewhere. Otherwise, I can produce and mail it for
about $8. If you'd like a copy, send me a mailing address, and I'll get it
out ASAP.
