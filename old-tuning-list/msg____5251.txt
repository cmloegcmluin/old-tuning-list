Subject: Re: TUNING digest 1034

From: Boris Krivulin <boris@knowarch.com>

I wonder where I could read about the basics of tunning. 
Can I experiment with tunning myself ? I play clarinet and saxophone, and I
got an piano keyboard. 

Iunderstand, though that tunning means reducing the number of tones per one
octave, 
and one example is the chineese pentatonic scales, which have only five
notes (however cover the same frequencies in total). After this process,
whould the general theory applied to the newly coinstructed octave or there
is some other theory ? 

In the various messages I saw mention a crod as a/b (e.g. 1/7). WHat does
this mean ?

And the last question: those who compose with all these different tunnings, 
is the music you is normal ? Or in the other way: does tunning give an
alterbative way 
to reach some common musical style in a faster way ? Is it just enother way
to solve and exersize ? 

thanks
