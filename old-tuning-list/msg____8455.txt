In response to my questions about her version of a neo-Gothic tuning, and
about how to distinguish between diatonic and chromatic intervals in a 12-tone
tuning, Margo Schulter wrote:

If I'm not mistaken, that would only apply if c were assumed to be the
starting place of the tuning.  If any tone of the 12-tone tuning might be
chosen as the first tone of a scale then that could change which (absolute)
tones were considered which type, right?  Perhaps that's one place that my
approach deviates from the Gothic.  Still, the tuning you originally specified
has some real merit, and could never be achieved using my methods.

I really like the idea of the 17-tone tuning you proposed, which should allow
both approaches.  Though my keyboard's tuning table only handles 12 tones, I
might be able to visualize a fantasy harp with 17 strings to the octave and
compose for it under the assumption that no more than 12 tones would be used
in any given composition.

Thanks for fully answering my questions, and for yet another brilliant
analysis!
