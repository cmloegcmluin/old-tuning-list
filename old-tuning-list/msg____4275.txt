What I did in my _Downing I_ tuning is to tune the Ds above middle C to G
(G/D = 2/3) while the Ds below middle C are tuned a 6/5 minor third below
F. So, when I play the progression above, I make sure that the ii is
voiced to only use the Ds below middle C, while the V chord uses Ds above.

Of course, that means that in the progression ii V the two Ds are not
really a common tone, but are a comma apart.  I find that, at least for
me, harmonic tuning is much more important than melodic tuning, so this
does not bother me.  I find that ANYONE notices harmonic tuning, while the
inconsistency of the two pitches used melodically is only noticeable to
those (including me) who are listening more carefully.  

This is, obviously, a compromise, but one that I am willing to live with,
and I prefer this solution above "averaging" the two pitches.

Your mileage may vary.
