Subject: New Microtunable Synth/Sampler

From: "jloffink" <jloffink@pdq.net>

According to the spec sheet I downloaded from the Yamaha UK site, the new
EX5, EX5R and EX7 synthesizer/samplers have microtuning features.  No other
details were given, but given Yamaha's past history I would expect keyboard
based tuning tables rather than octave ones.  The EX5 and EX5R have 128
voices and the EX7 has 64 voices.  Both can be expanded to 65 MB of RAM and
8 MB of Flash ROM.
