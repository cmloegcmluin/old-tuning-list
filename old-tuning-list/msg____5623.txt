Subject: Re: Modulating tunings

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

The composer can expect the performer to perform intonation based on
the memory of different systems -- within reason.  2, maybe 3 different
systems is certainly doable.  Individual distinctions from pitch to pitch
would seem unnecessary drudgery in the case of only 2 systems.

Rather than thinking of modulating between tunings, I prefer thinking in
terms of immigrating between tunings.  Now there are imharmonic tones and
imharmonic chords in the theory.

My original music is self-described as polymicrotonal, specifically
because of the healthy use of different tunings in single compositions.
The recent premiere of my cello concerto Odysseus featured 60 musicians in
almost as many tunings, in all kinds of combinations.  The sound was
new with unusual timbres in a new form of musical theater.  

As those who were there have signalled, just about everyone enjoyed it,
were happy, uplifted, even amazed.  It worked.  Sure, I get some of the
credit.  But it is because the sound space is so excitingly receptive to
still newer and fresher combinations of sounds in relationship that there
exists a new frontier in space.  

It's said that in the sub-atomic world there exists _only_ intervals.
Everthing is built upon.
