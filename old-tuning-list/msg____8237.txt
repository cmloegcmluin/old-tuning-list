Subject: Re: Java and MIDI

From: "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca>

Drew Skyfyre was asking about JAVA and MIDI on the Mac.

I'm working on a project for Win 95/NT which I will eventually have to port
to the Mac so I looked into Java and MIDI.  (I detest C++)  I found a few
things that might be helpful.

Java Sound is basically a software synth.  Check out Sun's website
http://java.sun.com/ for more info.

Softsynth.com ( http://www.softsynth.com/ what else!)  has a Java MIDI API
for both Mac and PC.

Midishare is an operating system for MIDI available at
http://www.grame.fr/english/MidiShare.html that supports both Windows and
Mac.

Bryan Quinn at
http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~bquinn/class/c95-mtd/ has information about
implementing Java MIDI using native methods.

Staccato is a MIDI API under development:
http://www.undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca/~srsouth/staccato/about.html
but it's only (so far) for OS-2 and Windows.  There are a couple of nice
articles about Java and MIDI however.

Hope this helps.
Fred.
