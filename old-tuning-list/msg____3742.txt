Daniel,

I'm not familiar with Fux's fundamental bass, but I know that I would 
disagree with Rameau where he does not allow the fundamental bass to 
progress by second.

My point about combination tones was that the masking that occurs with 
complexes constructed from subharmonic series members will be at least as 
bad as that which occurs with harmonic complexes.

And this quantification would have led to subharmonic relationships forming 
an arithmetic progression, the simplest progression to understand (and to 
continue to infinity).

True, but note the frequency is one over the ocsillatory preiod; therefore 
if temporal measurements are basic, as you say, oscillatory periods are 
logically prior to frequencies.

Note that only very recently is this the case; as recent and as 
scientifically astute a microtonal theorist as Huygens used the inverse 
representation (which could have referred to stringlengths, wavelengths, or 
periods).

I'm sure you knew what my answer would be: (a) frequency ratios describe the 
perception of the chord by the central pitch processor, so important 
characteristics such as the root of the chord can be inferred from this 
representation; (b) the combination tones will only make this representation 
more relevant in terms of the implied root. The importance and special 
status of the harmonic series, _especially_ when used to organize sine 
waves, cannot be denied. It comes into play every time we hear a musical 
instrument and we think we know what note it's playing.

What on earth do you mean?

>while the harmonic division was continuable indefinitely.

This seems utterly nonsensical. Clearly the harmonic divisions _had_ to be 
expressed in terms of the arithmetic divisions, not vice versa, in order to 
instruct makers of instruments where to put the frets. Your "set theoretic" 
distinction of one set as superior or more general than the other is 
likewise nonsense.

10^-33 what? 10^-33 meters? Are meters a unit of frequency? No, they are a 
unit of length. Therefore, it is at small lengths, of strings or of waves, 
where you would expect a "boundary problem"; i.e., high freqencies. Your 
argument falls flat on its face.
