Press Commentary on Exhibition:

"... the multifaceted form of the 35-frequency
construction of Young's current installation is
the principal reason it changes hallucinogenically
with every shift in perspective and why the tones
freeze in place as long as one is perfectly still
while the slightest gesture will startle forth
unnamable, wildly plumed melodies from the
luxuriant harmonic foliage. Zazeela's light
sculptures have invariably, teasingly refused
to surrender their entire secret to photographic
reprodution, so much do they depend on
the retinal impact of activated photons in real
time and so much do they exploit, in ways analagous
to Young's techniques, the creation of visual
combination tones and an accumulation of after-images."

-- Sandy McCroskey, 1/1, The Journal of the Just Intonation Network

"Young's newest sine-tone sculpture shimmers and
swirls as you walk around the room and, amazingly,
when you freeze, it does too.  Stay at least long
enough to stare at Zazeela's Imagic Light and Ruine
Window, which will imprint your retina with blues
and purples you haven't felt before."

-- Kyle Gann, The Village Voice

"The visitor with an acute ear can actually 'play'
the room like an instrument: explore the sound close
to the wall, close to the floor, in the corner, or
just standing still.  Or lie on the floor and allow
the sound to float you into heaven, slide you into
hell, or transport you wherever you want to go.
See if you agree with those who call Young's sound
sculpture a precursor of ambient music.
Zazeela's light installation, "Imagic Light," offers
an intriuging complement to the sound, even though
it is equally effective when viewed in
silence.  Using pairs of colored lights and suspended
aluminum mobiles cut out in calligraphic shapes,
Zazeela explores the relationship between object
and shadow, making the tangible intangible, and vice
versa.  Enjoy the installation for its mesmerizing
beauty, or try to analyze how the different
colors are achieved, how the mobiles create the
resulting shadows, or perspective the infinite number
of symmetrical patterns in the room."

-- David Farneth, Metrobeat
