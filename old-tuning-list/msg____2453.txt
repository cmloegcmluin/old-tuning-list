Huh? What in the world is "the Scarlet Aardvark" ?

and:

Hey! I like Bach, but does art have to be like sports?
I see this in advertising for classical music all the time
(and elsewhere...) The competitiveness makes me ill...

Give it a rest folks!
Art is not Sports!

Although I'm not familiar with all of Brian's top 20,
the "My Funny Valentine" variations are truly beautiful
and I remember a Mayumi Reinhard piece (the fully
13-limit tuning, Kishtet?) for synth and bassoon that 
really knocked me out. 

The Blackwood, Lansky, Darreg, Sims, Varese, and Johnston
pieces are quite fine too. And Johnny Reinhard's string quartet
Cosmic Ray's gets plenty of play around here since
it was on New Sounds.

under 3 feet of snow in N.J. with a good supply 
of cassettes and dat,
(I'm in big trouble if the power goes out! 
I might have to read a book or something.)
happy new year forks,
