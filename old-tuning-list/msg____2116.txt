Subject: RE: midi files

From: Brian Thomson <BrianT@post.emap.co.uk>

If you need the standard MIDI File format, I would heartily recommend   
"The File Formats Handbook" by Gunter Born, which has the format, as well   
as that of WAV files, 1-2-3 files, etc. Published by Thomson (!) Computer   
Press / ITP, 1995.

It's also on the WWW at:
http://www.ips.id.ethz.ch/~parish/midi/midi_file_format.txt

The easy way of putting it is to describe a SMF as made up of "chunks" -   
a header chunk with information about the file, followed by chunk after   
chunk of MIDI information with the time of the event in clock cycles (as   
taken against the timebase defined in the header chunk).

Good Luck,

Brian Thomson
