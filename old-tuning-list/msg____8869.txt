I don't know what modes have to do with it, as all modes of a scale have
the same intervals, but isn't the usual diatonic scale in 12-tone equal
temperament an example?

An ambiguity occurs between two intervals, therefore it is hard to know
what you mean by "one ambiguous interval." How about C D E F# G# in
12-tET?

What's a rank-order matrix? Can it apply to meantone-type or Keenan-type
scales as well?
