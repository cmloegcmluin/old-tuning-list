Subject: Response to Daniel Wolf

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

>(1) Does your central pitch processor depends on harmonic partials? Real
>instrumental sounds deviate significantly from a ideal series.

These deviations are small compared with the resolution of the central pitch 
processor (~1%). Actually, the central pitch processor works best when the 
relationships are slightly stretched, but this is a small effect.

>Does your
>processor make tolerance decisions at both the individual instrument
>(pitch) and the instrumental ensemble (chord) levels?

Yes, absolutely. A chord consisting of several "inharmonic series" could be 
analysed in this way. For a chord consisting of harmonic or near-harmonic 
series, the partials add no conflicting information as to the root should 
be. However, the partials can aid in making this judgment, especially if the 
chord tone fundamentals are rather low in pitch.

>It was for precisely

>orchestra.

Do you agree now that this assumption is incompatible with your treatment of 
subharmonic chords?

>(2) Are amplitude and phase differences among the partials ignored?

Yes, but phase differences do not affect the central pitch processor. 
Amplitude differences may, but as long as the fundamentals are similar in 
amplitude and have similar overtone structures, the ratio-interpretation 
should be correct.

>(3) Would it be terribly difficult to couple your root-finding function
>with some harmonic distance function in order to address chord
>progressions?

I don't see why it would be difficult. However, the character of chord 
progressions seems to me far more subjective and culturally influenced, or 
at least far more difficult to model, than the perception of virtual pitch. 
Although certainly general statements can be made, such as compounds of 
simple harmonics are more important for chord progressions, while higher 
harmonics are more important for chord construction.

My theory is only intended to predict the perception of chords under 
circumstances of long duration and equal amplitude -- the ideal 
circumstances for perceiving complex ratios. In other circumstances, the 
parameter that controls the precision of the central pitch processor's input 
signals can be adjusted to reflect less precision, and the results will show 
a preference for simpler relationships.


Some comments:

Then one has an essentially rootless sound, since no simple interpretation 
in terms of harmonics gets much certainty. For example, in 22-tet, the a 
pitch resolution of 1% leads to 0 6 11 being heard as 7:6:5 with a relative 
certainty of 38.5, while 0 5 11 has no such certain interpretation; the most 
likely interperetation is as 24:20:17 with a relative certainty of 8.70. 
(This is using the version of the algorithm that treats all inversions and 
extensions as equivalent).

They were probably just targeting a slighlty stretched 7/4. Terhardt 
addresses some possible explanations for this preference for stretching.

Might I suggest that their results were also far from unbiased.

This may often be useful.

Yes, but most people have not learned to distinguish these things.

Don't let me dissuade you from trying to formulate a wide-ranging theory of 
JI compostition. Sounds good to me.

Not necessarily. There are other possibilities:

(1) An apparently held tone was actually adjusted by a comma during a non-p5 
chord change.
(2) Tempering.

>(5) Which interpretation does this support? Your own analysis of the minor

Please re-read what I have said. The tonicity algorithm form only a part of 
the considerations of consonance and tuning. The other part is roughness, 
which I feel has been dealt with adequately in the research.

Sure it's possible. n->1/n.

This analogy is metaphysical and of limited value compared with an 
understnding of the virtual pitch phenomenon. Who's to say that the "object" 
is frequency and not period or string length.

I am sympathetic with an intuitionist philosophy of mathematics. However, 
the one subject to which I have devoted more study that microtonality is the 
foundations of quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics is 
eminently classical, though its metaphysics and epistemology are most 
certainly not. So assuming that mathmatics goes funny at the very small due 
to quantum effects would be viciously circular. Besides, if quantum effects 
were associated with musical tones, it would be with those of high pitch; 
low-pitch tones are low-energy-per-quantum waves and therefore behave 
classically.
