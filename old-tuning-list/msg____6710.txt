Subject: Re: Septimal Intervals

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

Gary Morrison, at least, seems to be listening to the same chords
as me:

However, I did actually specify 31 equal, where the situation is
more complicated.  In lieu of Gregg Gibson discovering why, I'll
respond to his other points:

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is taking a feature of 5-limit and
turning it into a principle.  I don't buy it.

Yes, bisecting the fifth is a bad idea with septimals.

I believe your fears are unjustified.

Exactly what are you trying to say, Gregg?  You come up with an
"undeniable" argument, and then deny it!  Or, am I
misunderstanding?  To my ears, these chords are certainly more
concordant than their constituent dyads.  Three examples are quite
enough to disprove that little theory.

What is "the senario(sic)" supposed to mean?  If 5-limit
consonance, we are talking about 6 triads within the octave --
3:4:5, 4:5:6, 5:6:8, 1/3:1/4:1/5, 1/4:1/5:1/6 and 1/5:1/6:1/8.
Granted, septimal chords don't work well in inverted forms with an
8/7. However, I am prepared to admit the utonal versions.  That
gives us ... 6 chords.  So, we've doubled the number available
from the 5-limit.

There is certainly doubt as to the first statement.  Unless you
consider all chords containing a septimal interval, when it is
true but septimals are no different to quintals in this respect.
There is no question that the 7-limit is a different sonority to
the 5-limit. Why this is an argument for rejecting 7-limit
consonances is beyond me.  Well-ordered systems are really
dreadfully early 20th Century.

My ignorance on the subject prevents me form getting into a
historical discussion.

Certainly, consonance and dissonance are relative concepts.  By
which I mean that a chord is only consonant or dissonant relative
to another chord.  Why is this absurd?

Well, that's Western musical theorists for you.  Do these include
the people who advocated 12 note well temperaments?

We're clearly going to get nowhere in a consonance/dissonance
argument.  I will, however, make the following assertions.
7-limit chords have a character which makes them closely akin to
5-limit consonances.  7-limit chords are sensitive to tuning and
so, if they are to be used, they must be considered in choosing
a temperament.  A well tuned 4:6:7 chord fulfils all the usual
criteria of concordance.  Some 5-limit chords, spread over more
than an octave, sound frankly dissonant -- see Helmholtz for more
on this.  In the right circumstances, a 7-limit chord can function
as a consonance.
