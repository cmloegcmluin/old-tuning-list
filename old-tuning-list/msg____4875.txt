                          I. Xenakis special guest
          ------------------------------------------------------

                          March 21-23  Lyon, France


A wide range of artistic and scientific disciplines make use of notational
systems. This is true for Music; it is also true for Chemistry,
Mathematics, Choreography just to name a few of them. These notational
systems have multiple and deep relationships with their discipline. They
reflect a state of knowledge as well as a vision of the world, but they are
also a decisive element in the evolution of their discipline.

The third Multidisciplinary Musical Meetings aims at taking stock of the
evolution and the roles of music notation as well as its interactions with
our thought and practices, by bringing together composers, musicologists,
performers and music historians. The question of notation will also be
examinated from the point of view of other disciplines like Dance,
Linguistics, Cognitive Sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science.

The program includes about twenty talks (with a special contribution of
composer I. Xenakis), debates and demos as well as an exhibition on Music
Notation.
