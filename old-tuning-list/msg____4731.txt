Ah, of course. Funny I didn't recognize the C as cents, since I've 
used a similar notation for the command line interpretation syntax 
of my MIDI tuning dump equal temperament generator in C (computer 
language). Here are some examples of the argument syntaxes it 
understands:

ET            [generates an equal temperament of random step width]
ET 12         [generates 12 tones per octave equal temperament]
ET 100 C      [generates equal temperament with step size of 100 cents]
ET C 100      [same as above]
ET 85.33333 Y [generates equal temperament with step size of 85.33333 
              yamaha tuning units (1024 per octave)]
ET Y 85.33333 [same as above]
ET 12 2 1     [generates equal temperament of 12 steps per 2/1 ratio]

If you allow Y into the terminological extensions, one might write 
4TET 300CET 256YET. 

I also like sometimes to measure intervals in fractions of an octave, 
such as 3/2 ~0.58496 octaves. This helps detwelvulate (thanks Ivor) 
the sense that you get from measuring intervals in cents.

BTW, it was playing with the random tunings from which I learned the 
most and that helped me understand that, to my intuitive ear anyway, 
all ET's lean towards one of two groups, those that provide close 
approximations of some number of just intervals, and ones that deftly 
avoid just intervals. There are some raucous ET's which give you 
almost no pitch combinations which are comfortable at all.
