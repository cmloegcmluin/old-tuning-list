Subject: Comments on the importance of tuning in New Scientist.

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

The following letter was published in the British science publication 
"New Scientist" 31st May 1997.

I thought that tuning list subscribers might be interested, and have some 
pertinent comments.  Some may even wish to defend the importance of 
musical tuning in this widely read and respected scientific journal. 
(Hint ;-) Nudge, nudge!. . . . . )
 
Unnatural Tunes
 
I hope that Charles Lucy succeeds in his attempt to reconstruct John 
Harrison's experiments in tuning (letters, 19 April, p55).  However two 
different questions are involved. 
An alternative basis for deriving musical intervals may be of great 
acoustical and mathematical interest in itself.  But its musical 
significance may be slight. 
Music as it has developed over the last five centuries has become 
an entirely artificial system with an elaborate logic of its own.  
This depends upon a hierarchy among pairs of related keys in which 
each key is regarded as all the others as a starting point, it being 
only the direction from it that matters.  To make this equality 
physically possible, all intervals other than the octave are very 
slightly "cooked". 
For most of us, the difference between the "cooked" and the natural 
version is so slight that it becomes lost in the idiosyncracies of 
performance.  
I rather suspect that, whether one considers Harrison's or any other 
alternative basis for tuning, the same may prove to be true.
