In a message dated 97-07-14 02:24:15 EDT, you write:

One also might point out that the list IS about Tuning in theory AND
practice. I think Neil is just trolling for flames. Poke an insult at 
the list to see if he can get people pissed off and maybe start a 
flame war. He does this every couple of weeks with veiled references
like: 1. microtonalists can't play music, maybe even as well as him, 
2. microtonalists are not spiritually connected through music, as well as 
for example as him, 3. microtonalists can't compose, they don't 
meet up to his lofty standards - they just noodle.

I can't believe that anyone would set themselves up for such intense
examination.
