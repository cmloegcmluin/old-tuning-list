Subject: Web sites

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

I've been trying to download the new JI Calc, but the ftp site seems to be
down for one reason or another.

My message here, however, is not to complain about access; it is to comment
that Bill Alves has updated "links" page on the JI Network WWW site, and it
is incredible how much new material we have, compared to just a year ago!
Most notable to me are two (new?) sites:

The first is DEDALUS, a microtonal festival about which I was not
previously aware.  There isn't much information about the history of this
(ensemble?), but I would certainly like to know more.  It seems that Didier
Aschour is a performer with them, so perhaps you could tell us some more,
Didier.

A mistake seems to be in the html code, in that the "Microstock" entry
connects you to John Starret's home page, which I found to be
incredible--the best web site that I have seen so far.  Immediately upon
entering the site, Bach's French Suites serenade you via streaming MIDI and
Quick Time.  Other music accompanies other sections of the site, including
JI and microtonal music.

Good job, people.  Keep up the good work.  I should plug my own site here
since it has moved--I am now found at http://pantheon.yale.edu/~abs22.
It's the same old stuff, but updated with new links and a composition list.
Please change your links.
