But I don't think Paul E. meant 1:1 relationship.  I think he meant that
any consonance would always subtend the same number of scales steps, but
not necessarily that this number of scales steps couldn't represent a
dissonance, or another consonance.  But it still doesn't change the fact
that propriety says nothing about connsonance or dissonance - it only
addresses the relative sizes of intervals associated with scale steps.  And
so a given scale could be proper and not meet Paul's criteria; the
consonance in question could be an ambiguous interval.

But all in all, a small point.
