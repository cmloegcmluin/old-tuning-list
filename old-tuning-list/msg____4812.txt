You say people wouldn't believe you (you assume) because you 
have a vested interest in having your model be accepted, so 
you are excused from posting your model. It's interesting 
that this logic doesn't also prevent you from posting claims 
that you have a model.

Actually it is theories, not laws, which compete.

I keep seeing posts and cross posts which explain that the partials 
of real plucked or hammered strings are not exactly harmonic. I don't 
see anyone arguing what you call "prevailing law". I think this is
what's called a "strawman"--when you state an opposing argument 
noone actually holds, hoping that by then destroying that
argument you can indirectly prove your own argument. Unfortunately
it doesn't prove anything.

None of the web sites which links you've posted have any
description of the mapping of partials. All your web sites 
describe (and not very clearly) is that one can build an 
extensible tuning system on 2 irrational intervals, neither 
of which is pi. I suspect that there are an indefinite number 
of such tuning systems using pairs of irrational intervals, 
all of which would produce beating sonorities.

If you want to speak musically, and say you like the sound
of your scale, I have no objection at all, and I encourage
you. I too like the sound of the beating in the lullaby examples.

It's one thing to work with materials artistically to get a 
pleasing result, it's another to investigate the physics
of acoustic bodies, the theoretical structures of tuning 
systems, and the psychoacoustics of human perception. 

I have no vested interest in any particular model; I'm 
curious about all of them--that's why I read this list. 
If you do indeed have a model, I suggest that this 
particular forum is the _ideal_ place to discuss it--if 
you would only begin to do so.
