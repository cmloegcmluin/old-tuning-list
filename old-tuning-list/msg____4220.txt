From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@CompuServe.COM>

I have a quick commentary on Neil's post regarding lack of musical excitement
in microtonal music.  

   First of all, I agree that there's a very real problem there.  That's why
I've been taking up the real saxophone recently - so that I can try to regain
the raw performance skill I've lost over the last several years of theorizing
and composing.  

   Second, I would take Neil's concern one step farther in one particular
direction:  Some of us will just have to accept that we're not cut out for
certain types of musical pursuit, and take some other form of microtonal
pursuit.  I have to accept that that may even end up applying to me with regard
to producing CDs of my music.  I haven't given up by any stretch of the
imagination, and am thus improving my chops in order to remedy that particular
problem.  

   Whether and when to give up is something that each of us has to decide for
himself, the hard part being figuring out how to take constructive criticism.
It's very easy to either give up entirely, rather than doing the hard work of
locating the SPECIFIC problem and fixing it.  And on the other end of spectrum
it's easy also to ignore the criticism entirely, which is usually a very bad
idea.  The difficulty of that task is compounded by the fact that SOMETIMES
(although not often), some constructive criticism really SHOULD be ignored
entirely or serve as a sign that you really should COMPLETELY give.  

   But perhaps even more important is, if you do give up on performing,
composing, or whatever, to find some other area where you CAN contribute.  

   Third, I think it's important to note the difference between Neil's criticism
here and some of the other postings with a critical tone (and no, I'm not
refering to any single person here).  Neil's critique has carefully avoided
mentioning specific names in this public forum.  He has clearly reserved that
for person-to-person direct communication.  He also clearly mentioned his own
weaknesses as well, that he's primarily a performer over a theorist.  Neil has
also taken that fact into account in his own persuits too:  He hasn't created
any new tuning systems that I know of, but has instead exploited his true
talent, which is performance.  That's admirable.  

   Fourth and finally, I think it's important to follow up critiques of this
sort with specific person-to-person critique.  I say that because this sort of
posting is bound to raise a lot of questions in peoples' minds in addition to
Neil's main aim, which is to ask us to just generally practice our trade more
than trade it.  A lot of people are probably asking "hmmm... who is thus and so
sentence in particular refering to?"  So I hope that he and others will do an
effective follow-up as well.
