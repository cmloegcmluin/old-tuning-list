   Ah yes, that's a worthwhile point that's easy to lose sight of.  My
guitar teacher back in Dallas (before I let my guitar skills rust over to
their hideous current state!) used to lament a bit the idea of exploring
new tunings, because he felt that the movement to equal temperament was one
of the comparatively few historical cases where the guitar and guitar music
was ahead of the musical trends.

   I guess he felt it ironic that folks like we tuning-listers want to
reverse that.  But I like to think that the fact that guitars are one of
the better instruments for exploring new tunings puts it on the cutting
edge!

   I for one will look forward to hearing that.  I'm sure that, if anybody
can pull it off, it would be Neil Haverstick!
