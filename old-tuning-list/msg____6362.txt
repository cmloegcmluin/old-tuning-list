I'm sure that Ranier Plomp would be somewhat surprised to find out
that he is already dead.

Here is a brief definition of sensory dissonance:

(1) Define the sensory dissonance between two sine waves to be
given by the psychoacoustic data gathered by Plomp and Levelt. (A
simple approximation to this is given below).

(2) Given two sounds F and G, one with partials at frequencies f1, f2,
f3, f4, etc and the other with partials at frequencies g1, g2, g3, g4,
etc. Define the sensory dissonance between F and G to be the sum of
all the dissonances between all the sine wave partials, weighted by
the relative amplitudes of the partials.

Suppose two sine waves are at frequencies f and g. The data
gathered by Plomp and Levelt can be parameterized as the
difference between two exponentials

                      exp(-a |f-g|) - exp(-b |f-g|)

where a and b are constants. For details, see my paper in JASA, Sept
93. If you need a computer program that implements these
calculations, I can mail you one.
