Subject: Tuned tunes and the Tape Swap update

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

In response to David Finnamore and Peter Blasser's conversation about pop and
microtonality- I just picked up a CD by the Orb ( a techno/electronica band)
and it has at least one extended microtonal piece on it. Couldn't tell you the
tuning , however. It's really pretty good.

The Orb are very popular and I've been seeing more and more microtonal stuff
pop up in pop records. Brian Eno's record with Jah Wobble called "Spinner" is
peppered with it. It's also one of Eno's best records in a while, IMHO.

I don't know if I agree with David's opinion that the more jarring and
dramatically different a tuning is the greater chance it'll have of being
accepted. I think that type of flash can be very catchy briefly but there is
nothing inherentthat would make it more acceptable in the long run. In the end
I think it really comes down to whether your dealing with your musical
vocabulary honestly and with some sort of feeling. That's what I like about
thetrack on the Orb's record it puts musicality before manifesto as has Brian
Eno through the bulk of his career. BTW the Orb's record is called
"Orblivion". Which, has to be one of the worst titles I heard in my life.
The microtonal track, btw, is fairly simple, but nice.

As for the Tape Swap, I just got all materials in hand (except for one
submission). I'm really busy, now but I will do my best to get it out by the
first week in October. So, look forward to seeing them then. When I get the
playing order properly compiled I will print it here so you all can see what
you have to look forward to.

Thanks to all contributers! It has been enlightening and really great
communicating with so many interesting composers and theorists.
