I think that many list members might be surprised to learn that twentieth
century American music is probably better represented in European
concert/radio programs than in programs in America. What is most
interesting, however, is that it is works of the American experimental
tradition that get played, not of the ''Academic'' varieties. I would guess
that both Ruggles and Crawford-Seeger are better known (i.e. included in
High School-level music courses; concert programs; broadcasts) here than in
the U.S.. In Germany, at least, the rehearsal system is advantageous in
that the performers are usually paid for adequate preparation time and the
ensembles  usually have a core membership that guarantees some continuity
not found in American freelance groups.

The musical highlights of my time in Frankfurt have all been performances
of American music: two different performances of Ives Fourth Symphony
(Peter Eo''tvo''s is a brilliant Ives conductor), all of the orchestral
works of Morton Feldman, the Cage _Europeras_, and the festival intended
for Cage's eightieth birthday. Curiously, I have heard more live music here
by La Monte Young (two premieres) and Alvin Lucier (solo concert, premier
of his (microtonal) string quartet, installations) than I managed to hear
while studying with both in five years living near NYC.

Curiously, when the U.S. Information Agency sponsors concert tours, they
are usually limited to the academic set (Carter, Babbitt, Harbison et al);
the performances are typically under-rehearsed and have made little impact
on the musical life here. 

A look at a standard reference work in German, Ulrich Dibelius's _Moderne
Musik II_, will show that the following Americans receive more than passing
mention: Brown, Cage, Feldman, Glass, Nancarrow, Reich, Riley, Chr. Wolff,
Young. It is interesting to see that Arnold Dreyblatt and Harry Partch
receive as much attention as Carter or Babbit.

I have often said that I had to come to Europe to become an American
composer - and this is mostly because I had to come to Europe to hear
American music!
