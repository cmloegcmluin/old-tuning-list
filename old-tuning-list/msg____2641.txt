Subject: Re: Mutiple octave division system

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Thierry:

This is the basis for polymicrotonality which I believe is a natural 
development of microtonal systems.  Next year, Ivan Wyschnegradsky's 
theoretical work "Pansonority" will be released out of Geneva, 
Switzerland, edited by Patrice Criton.  In it, Wyshnegradsky spoke of 
modulating between tuning systems, much as metric modulation.
