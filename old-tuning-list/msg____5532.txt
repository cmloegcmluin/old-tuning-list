Subject: modes

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Paul Erlich is quite right in identifying the qualitative difference thatmajor and minor have with respect to the other diatonic modes when placedin a polyphonic voice leading situation. Among other things, the placement
of the diminished fifth (_tritone_ ought to be saved for the pythagorean
729/512, on analogy with the ditone) allows for counterpoint with greaterfreedom for inverting voices, which becomes essential in tonal
counterpoint, canon, and fugue. However,  _melodically_ these modes
function perfectly well when the melodic rules for the more traditional
modes are followed (that is - Major as combination of mixolydian and lydian
and minor as a combination dorian, phrygian and lydian). In fact, I thinka
good case could be made for hearing early works in Major or minor as a kind
of rapid _raga malaka_ where changes of harmony allow local melodic
fragments to shift from one modal melodic type to another.

Although the study of musical intonation provides fertile ground for
hearing these things flexibly, all too often the result is the opposite. I
heard a lecture a decade or so ago by a famous African American composer
and theorist who wanted to analyse _all music_ in terms of the lydian mode
because it was the one where the the tonic coincided with the lowest termin a series of fifths. I pointed out that this was fine as a model for
composition - and many fine compositions were made using his model - but
could not be applied analytically to all music. In simple voice leading,
the diminished fifth of the lydian mode would always resolve to the
dominant and the Bach example he used simply didn't do this. The good
professor responded: ''And that's where Bach went wrong...'' Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
