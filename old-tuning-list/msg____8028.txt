Subject: Microtunable wishlist

From: "jloffink" <jloffink@pdq.net>

I have posted my microtonal wishlist to my web site at
http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/architectures.html .  Note that there is no
direct link from the Microtonal Synthesis home page yet. I invite all
comments either directly to me or to the list.
