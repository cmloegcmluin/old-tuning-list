It's not 11-limit JI but your selection of pitch classes therefrom that   
prevents your particular scale from being diatonic.  You can find seven   
pitch classes in 12TET that don't make a diatonic scale.

Your definition of mode started out with "1) A tuning system, though it   
may be somewhat flexible".  What would you say is the (flexible) tuning   
system for, say, the Aeolian mode?  If 3-limit JI and 12TET are not   
variations of it, how can they both represent that mode?

My whole point is that the flexibility that is required is greater than   
the difference between these tuning systems.  Heck, most singers and   
string players have vibratos wider than that!

.. and on the intended instruments, with the intended performance   
technique, with the intended phrasing, etc.  These are all important   
performance considerations - change any one of them and the performance   
suffers.  The particular tuning used, however, is probably the least   
noticeable of these.  How many people can tell the difference between   
12TET and 5-limit JI in a string quartet played with the usual vibrato?

Change any of these considerations (to a point, of course) and the piece   
is still considered to be the same piece.  Change the melodies and   
harmonies - the *notes* - and it is not.  (The concept of *note* here is   
not as precise as that of *pitch*.)

In many cases, the most difficult of these considerations for a   
historically informed performer to determine is which tuning the composer   
intended.

I agree that it would greatly enrich any student's musical education, not   
only to increase understanding of non-common-practice music, but also to   
increase understanding of the tuning systems that have been used *within*   
that tradition.  But those students you mention are not accepting 12TET -   
they're only accepting that there are 12 notes in an octave, *roughly*   
evenly distributed in pitch.  How many of them even know what 12TET is?   
 To most of them, "tuning" is a verb, not a noun, and "temperament" is a   
psychological term.
