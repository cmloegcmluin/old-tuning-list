Subject: Larry A. Hanson

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I was saddened to hear of Larry A. Hanson's death from Neil in his 
post this morning. Larry was a brilliant and creative theorist 
who had been collaborating with Ervin Wilson since 1978. In addition 
to his championing 34-tet and commissioning the guitar that Neil plays 
so well, Larry independently invented a unique type of generalized 
keyboard in 1942 for his wife Evelyn, a concert pianist. Although his 
keyboard  was also intended for 53-tone equal temperament, the design 
was different from Bosanquet's. 

After the war, he called Loren Hammond of the Hammond Organ Company, 
who, alas, showed little interest. Larry put his notes aside until 
1977, when his daughte Chris came across them while helping him 
straighten up some files. In 1978, Chris saw an article about Tom Stone 
and his interchangeable fingerboard guitar in Rolling Stones magazine. 
This article led to a meeting with Ervin Wilson, who was immediately
enthusiastic about Hanson's design.  Ervin pointed out that Larry's 
keyboard could be construed as based on a two-interval pattern (MOS) 
generated by cycle of 19 minor thirds. 

At Ervin's urging, Larry published a definitive article on the keyboard 
in Xenharmonikon 12 (1989), when Daniel Wolf was the editor. Erv prepared 
drawings which showed how various equal temperaments and several forms 
of Just Intonation (the 13-limit Ogdoadic Diamond and two 5-limit 
triadic arrays) could be mapped over the array of keys. At this time,
Larry also invented a new type of digital shaped like interlocking, 
block "7's" to facilitate fingering.

Larry also maintained his interested in the purely theoretical side of
xenharmonics. He was extremely good at finding relevant articles on 
number theory in the Cal Tech Library (from which graduated in 1942),
and he applied his mathematical ability and computational skills to
many theoretical problems in tuning theory, usually in collaboration
with Ervin Wilson. He was a great resource for the xenharmonic community
and he will be greatly missed by all of us who knew him and worked with
him.
