        Yeah, thats true.  But I though it was amazing when he described it
to me because it might say something about either where/how we physically
'sense' intervals (as oppose to mentally 'percieve'), or how/why some
people have trained and/or learned "absolute pitch memory" or 'perfect
pitch'.  In that sense, the face may be a better sound antenna than I
originally thought.
        Since my parents are suing in this matter (the accident), this
phenomenon will become part of the public record in about a year, when our
hot-shot SF plaintiff-attourney shall begin "depositions".

Peace and Harmony!
Rick.
