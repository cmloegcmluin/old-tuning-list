Subject: Re: TUNING digest 583

From: marcus@fa.disney.com

Hi all,

I'm researching what my next keyboard should be so I can investigate alternate
tuning systems.  I see votes for the Ensoniq k2000 (although I can't find any
reference to it on Ensoniq's home page (http://www.ensoniq.com)).  Any others?

Also, I'm particularly interested in your experiences performing non-12 tone
tunings on a traditional keyboard, which is of course designed for 12 tone
usage.  I see new challenges trying to play pieces in 19 and 24 tone tunings.
 Especially 24...can you imagine having to span what is a 10th in 12tet to make
a 5th in 24?  Yow.

Thanks,
Marcus
