Subject: Catch All

From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com>

Working two full-time jobs and trying to find rent in the landlord's market
that is the Bay Area of California, while living in a friend's house and
contributing to the tuning list (especially when it's been so active --
good to see) is not always easy.  So we have the catch all message....

Okay.  The idea seems to make sense.  We're talking about 15 cents, on
average?

What isn't clear is just what the claim is as to what mistuning like this
does to interval perception.  Whatever it is, you seem to feel it's big
enough to cause problems in ET's over 35/oct.  And then there's the matter
of the thing being based on pure tones.  What about tones with partials?

Sorry if I mis-understod your standpoint.  Maybe we're closer to agreeing
on this than I thought.  I did not mean to mis-represent your ideas.

Okay.  Gary, representing the prime-number advocates (of which, I will be
sure to add, he is not necessarily one), said that steely coldness was
often considered to be related to the FACTOR of 3.  You start out by saying
"an arbitrary power of 2 produces an effect of equivalence", and then
finish up asking if a power of 3 can produce steely coldness.  But it is a
factor of three that is supposed to produce steely coldness.

Any change in power (stacking the interval two, or however many times) is
supposed to produce equivalence, falling off as stacking brings the
compound interval close in size to an interval with different prime factors
(like you point out with the 81/64 vs. 5/4 example -- although, as I said,
I don't think the the 81/64 is close enough to the 5/4 to mask its 3-ness).

I hope this helps.

This is a very good point, provided you allow a movable 1/1.  

However, I will note that, in my experience, I have often need caution when
considering attempts of music theory to say, "and in this period,
such-and-such was considered dissonant, etc..."  I gather that Mr. Erlich
is quite a fan of such approaches; he insists in his 22TET paper on
nitpicking that "a better definition would be that 5-limit intervals are
considered consonances in this music, and therefore need to be tuned with
some degree of accuracy" [quoting from memory].

My objection to this approach is basically that:

1. It seems to be an over-generalization.  Different composers use lots of
different things in lots of different ways, even in the same "period".

2. It has never, in my experience, proven useful in the composition of new
music.

Don't I use this idea when talking about music evolving by prime limit?
Not really.  Because you will NEVER hear a higher prime being used
harmonically in the earlier style.  It's not a question of what they
considered it because they *didn't* consider it.

But I may yet be swayed, if only it can be demonstrated that odd limit is
really needed to describe a real phenomenon in the way intervals are
treated in music.

I'm going to catch you yet Erlich, biasing your science to support equal
temperaments!

Shit.

An intentional effort by a composer using a fixed-pitch instrument.
Covered in my post.

Sort of like you could tell what prime limit music on a 33 is, playing at
45 rpms, but not what odd limit the same music was without hearing it at
actual speed?

I agree, and will go one further.  I believe the 81/64 can be treated as a
consonance.  I believe anything can (and has been) treated as a consonance
(and I am not talking about serialsim, where consonance is not an issue).
The 12-tone 5/4 is treated as a consonance.  I wonder what Mr. Erlich
thinks about this, since it very close both in size and derrivation to the
81/64.  He doesn't seem to have a problem considering a 7 cent sharp 3/2
consonant! 
This 3/2, to my ear, makes the triads of 22 no better than those of 12,
despite the better third.

I've always viewed these "commas" as making modulation more interesting.
But many disagree.  Partch's chapter in Genesis of a Music is really great
about this point (the one with the letter from Fox-Strangeways).  Boy that
chapter is really a thrill!

Basically, what I got from this chapter is that modulation is best defined
simply as switching the 1/1, and that common tones, while playing, of all
things, perhaps the most important role in the use of modulation, are not
necessary in its definition or execution.  And perhaps, that a theory of
modulation may be constructed where tones separated by a comma can still be
considered "common"!

I agree.  And while the scalpal cuts into some dead guy's ear, I will ask:

Even if the "association of certain intervals with the tuning systems in
which they occur" (that is, I asume, some sort of cultural conditioning) is
the only way we can pick prime factors apart from odd ones in music, are we
not still performing a prime factorization on what we hear?

I will also recommend Adler's book, which was recommened by Paul Hahn.  I
have another book which I also like, which is very new, by Kent Kennan.
These are the two standard texts in orchestration right now.  I have them
both, but cannot remember the titles of either of them (they're both back in 
Pennsylvania).
