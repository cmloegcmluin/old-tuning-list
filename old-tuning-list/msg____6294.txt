(You mean that they *would* remain so convinced, right?)

Because there aren't any microtones at play.  A=440 is far from a
universal convention.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the
international pitch standard is still 435, and most major orchestras play
higher, upwards of 448.  (The string players think they sound better
there - it drives the wind players nuts.)  Early music players tune to
A=415 ... or 392 ... or 460 ...  because 250 years ago reference pitches
varied considerably, with choirs and chamber ensembles often having
different (by a third or more) reference pitches at the same time and
place!  Even if you didn't travel, you had to be good at transposition,
and there are Bach cantatas where the recorder parts are written in a
different key so the instruments would end up playing at the same pitch.
 Perfect pitch may be more curse than gift!

Is this not why folks on this list use ratios and cents to describe
intervals from an arbitrary reference, notated 1/1?

So no matter what your reference pitch, if all the intervals in your
performance are powers of the twelfth root of 2, you're playing in 12TET.
 Thus a "microtone", whatever it is, is an interval, not a pitch.

Well, this is throwing in a completely different definition of the word
"tone", meaning "timbre"....

I suspect that the problem with the word "microtone" is that it has been
applied to tunings far removed from the context of its invention.  Didn't
the word come out of early 20th-century experiments with 24TET, 96TET,
and other tunings that were derived by subdividing 12TET?  Its meaning
seems clear in that context.

Now it gets applied to things like 7TET, the intervals of which are
barely smaller than a tone, far from "micro".  It seems to be no more
specific than a cue word to indicate a non-12TET interval.  In that
sense, sure, an interval between two microtones is another microtone,
however wide, as long as it is not 2^(n/12).  But this strips the word of
almost all meaning.

Hmm - "microtonal" essentially meaning "unfamiliar" - a good place for
the word "xenharmonic".  Would someone brought up listening to Indian
music get the same sensation on hearing 12TET?

How far away must one get from the familiar doors to produce the
microtonal sensation?  If you played "Mary Had a Little Lamb" in
Pythagorian tuning, who would consider that microtonal?

The predominance of the equal-tempered piano and fretted guitar has
evidently led many to overlook that, to this day, good musicians who can
produce arbitrary pitches do not consider C# and Db to be the same pitch.
 (They may say otherwise, but one must judge from their performance!)  Is
the music they produce microtonal?

The exclusion of music thought to be 12TET by the speaker or writer but
never actually *performed* in 12TET strips "microtone" and "microtonal"
of the rest of their meaning.


I think it would be best to restrict the word "microtone" to "an interval
significantly smaller than a 12TET semitone", and "microtonal" to "making
explicit use of microtones".  Then we need other words to describe the
scope of the AFMM.  Since I'm not sure what exactly is excluded, I'm not
sure what to suggest.  ("The American Festival of Nonquasiequidodecatonic
Music" - ruling out "sort-of-12TET" music ???)


Musing further,
