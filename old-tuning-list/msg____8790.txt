Subject: Re: LIMIT OR CAP

From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I think there is a misconception that I think needs to be address. In
the number world, primes have a special property, that does not
translate into the music world. This is the case with the ninth which
can be explained as the 3 of 3 but musically exist as an entity itself.
This is not how it treated in many cases, the disjunction of tetrachords
being one example. The same can be said about the 15 in my experience,
There is also a problem with the word limit because if we talked of 11
limit it could be thought of as not being allowed. the word "cap" is
less ambiguous--
