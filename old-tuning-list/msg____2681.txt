I find it interesting that you feel that just intonation constrains the
number of chords. Certainly you would have as many different chords
available in a 19-tone just system. More actually. What just intonation
constrains is the ability to modulate (and have it sound the same). Perhaps
this is what you mean by using the chords "freely." In a just system the
same "chord" as defined by the notes in the system used relative to the
tonic would often sound different relative to different tonics. Thus if you
finger a "major chord" on the piano, it will not always be a 4:5:6 in just
intonation.

You may find this a weakness of JI. Because modulation was so important to
European composers in the four hundred years or so before this century,
many of them certainly thought it was a weakness. I, however, find it one
of JI's endearing strengths. Different keys have very different attributes
-- they each become a new "world of sound."

I suppose a flip answer would be "his music" or "music he likes." I think
he and a lot of other composers love the crystalline purity of just
intervals. I have talked to other JI composers who ask why composers who
use temperament systems go to such lengths to approximate just intervals
within their systems. Why not just use a just system to begin with? An
answer might be that you want the ability to modulate freely and have it
sound the same. And, of course, there are composers who are not interested
in just intervals to begin with. But, personally, I love the sounds of JI
and don't find it a constraint to my composition at all.
