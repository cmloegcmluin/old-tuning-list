Buddies,

Since I have been lurking, a couple of comments came together to get me
babbling again, and they be:

>and boy, this list is sort of dull lately...too much polite math
>talk...we need a good controversy to get things rolling...Hstick

.. followed closely by ...

>Or perhaps people don't use ANY notation if they can avoid it. Those of 
>us who use non-realtime instruments might need some sort of chart or 
>table to help in making a piece, but a detailed score seems superfluous. 
>Of course, the situation may be different where performers are involved 
>but I find it a tremendous relief not to have to bother with it.
>
>Paul Turner 

Seems to me that the last few weeks have been looking as if sponsored by the
old HP Calculators.  Question in general: being that most all involved here
are interested in tuning alternatives to 12TET, and sounds like most wish
that more people could experience the lovely/ugly/amazing worlds that these
intonations open up, wouldn't we all be forwarding the cause if more music
were created that *involved* people, rather than spanking the
software-monkey another time?

I know the pleasures myself of having the control of every note and nuance,
or letting an algorithm do it's thing.  Nonetheless, and cognizant of the
wonderful pieces that have been done in 'non-realtime', does any of it
compare to the community experience of, say, playing in a gamelan?  And
doesn't Paul's last bit, "the situation may be different where performers
are involved but I find it a tremendous relief not to have to bother with
it" read almost like "bother with them" (i.e., live musicians performing the
work)?

[NOTE: apparently the PC police have been attempting to control the terms
here on the tuning list, too: is it non-12TET? allotonal? microtonal?
xenharmonic? what???]

Given the choice of *doing* intonational music or *having it done to me*, I
know which I would choose, and it is the same one that I propose would be
most, um, beneficially nurturing to a larger audience and/or new performers.

..or something like that.  Gad, it's true: Neil H. and I are twin
love-children of Elvis and Nadia Boulanger!

Cheers,
Jon

PS: What I find lacking in the list of late are the laconic and luxurious
linguistics of G. Taylor, but maybe that's just me...
