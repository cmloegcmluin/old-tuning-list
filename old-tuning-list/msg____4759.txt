Again with the semantics!  How silly!

I like  this, Gary:

>* "Harmonics" to mean partials that are in fact harmonically related.

But Lucy says:

>Let's call the sounds we hear when we touch the string lightly,,
>(which Matt calls "complex tones"):
> "ghosttones" (for the sake of clarity).

No!  Let's call them "Flageolet tones" like the rest of the world (except
France, who might think that you're talking about a bean).

Since when is music a purely intellectual mechanism?

You're right that music is not purely intellectual, but it is therefore
foolish to propose a non-harmonic basis for your "pure-tuning" since
strings will differ among themselves, and certainly all instruments will be
wildly different from the others in your orchestra.

On another note...
	Forget the new millenium!  Here is the most important landmark of
our time...20 days until Tuning Digest 1000!
