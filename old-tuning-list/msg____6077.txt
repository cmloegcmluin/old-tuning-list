There are a number of historical treatises from India on the topic, and
several contemporary Indian writers who have discussed the topic. However,
as in the West, many of these writers seem to be writing from the
perspective of theorists rather than practicing musicians, thus may be
reflecting numerological ideals rather than musical realities. Modern
musicians such as Nazir Jairazbhoy are, of course, exceptions, and I would
certainly recommend his book to this list, which has a significant chapter
on tuning.

Of course most Indian musicians, as Ali Akbar Khan points out, have no need
of standardization. Instruments like the sitar have movable frets, and the
sarod, sarangi, violin, (and voice) of course, have no frets. Only with the
harmonium did the disease of 12TET standardization enter the subcontinent,
and most purists hate it. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to try to discover
either empirically or directly from practicing musicians what their tuning
ideals are. Such information, which may vary from musician to musician, can
still tell us a lot about the music.

As someone else pointed out, this is hardly different from the West.
However, I would caution against jumping to the conclusion that if
musicians are unaware of a theory of ratios or how to count beats then they
are not knowledgable about tuning. I have talked with a few professional
Indonesian tuners who have a very sophisticated ear and who can speak very
knowledgably about different tunings and their effects, but if you were to
ask them about ratios or beats they wouldn't have any idea what you were
talking about. They may speak of tuning by the "rasa" ("feel") of the
sound, but I wouldn't assume such "intuition" (if that's what it is) was
incompatible with systematization or sophistication.
