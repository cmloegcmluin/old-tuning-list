Subject: virtual orchestra on the net

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.or.jp>

BUYO-BUYO-IGOR writing,
I'm building an virtual orchestra on my web-site.
http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~buyobuyo/songs/one.html
This page has some simple fragments for this orchestra's standard "Song 
No.1".
The idea is to have a bunch of links aimed to files on other people's 
site...this file can be anything (midi,csound-thing,max-
patch,aiff...etc) but have to have relationship to what is mentioned as 
key fragments.

# Microtuning oriented wackey arrangements...WELCOME!!

Would someone create files for this orchestra?
thanx
