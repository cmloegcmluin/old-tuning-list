I have one of his recordings, and it sounds like a regular Nashville E9th
tuning in JI to me.  That's the traditional way the instrument is tuned.
See my article at http://wco.com/~quasar/articles/just_e9.html

One of my steel guitar necks is tuned to a C Pentatonic, and of course I was
struct with the same dilemma.  I use a meantone temperment on that neck.  I
actually only use JI on my Hawaiian (non-pedal) steel guitars.

Jerry Byrd has recorded extensively on his C diatonic Hawaiian guitar
tuning.  The 7 string tuning, low to high, is E F G A B C E.  Notice how he
omits the D note, making the instrument quite tunable "by ear".  He says
that it was the last innovative tuning he developed, and that he started
using it on records in Nashville in 1952.  That sweet intonation sold a lot
of hit country records!

The most stunning use of the C Diatonic is his "Steel Guitar Romantic
World", a collection of Japanese pop songs.  The accompaning orchestra is
12TET, but Byrd's solos are inspirational and JI of course.
