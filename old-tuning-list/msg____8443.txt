New gear alert for guitarists:
To see a picture (no description yet!?!) of a device that allows "regular"
guitarists to bend strings in a steel-like manner, and might possibly be
adapted to microtonal use, point your browser to

http://www.epiphone.com/products/epiphone/inst/Gig-Rig/

and click on the EZ-Bender button.  Curiously, the device was invented by
Richard Bowden of country parody group Pinkard and Bowden.  He demonstrated it
this morning on The Johnboy and Billy Show (a syndicated morning show for
rednecks - don't ask <g>).  I plan to check it out at MARS music store next
week and will update you then if somebody doesn't beat me to the punch.  Cross
your calloused fingers!
