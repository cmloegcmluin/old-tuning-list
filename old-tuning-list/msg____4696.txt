Subject: Re: Barbershop theory

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I just received a set of 8 posts from the Harmonet (barbershop 
discussion group) from Thomas Arneberg on the musical foundations of 
barbershop harmony, and there is some very interesting stuff in them. I 
am posting them on my Microtonal page at

http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html

under Notes on Microtonality. Unfortunately I have not yet had the time 
to format these in HTML, so they are just raw text, and the tables are 
garbled. I will be glad to forward these as e-mail (format intact) to 
anyone who's interested.
