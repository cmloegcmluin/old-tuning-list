Subject: RE: Chinese musical scales

From: linusliu@HK.Super.NET (Linus Liu)

There is not just one "Sheng". My eyes have seen sheng with
number of pipes ranging from five to at least fifteen, or many 
more. I did not walk round to count it (how many fingers?).

Instruments are not built to perform "scales", but rather, music.
Neither is there only just one kind of Chinese music, but in fact,
numerous. Very often, Chinese music are played together by many
kinds of instruments, together playing a same melody, at a same or
different octaves. And most of these instruments have very different
ways of tuning, due to their very different constructions.

To judge how MUSIC is tuned by how one instrument, in particularly
one with the greatest of limitations, is tuned is like judging the 
magnitude of World War II by the size of the stage a drama about 
World War II has been played on it.

Music is judged by how music appeals to the audience. Music is art.
Art is freedom from many limits. This is at least one way how I see it.

Linus Liu.
