Subject: undertones

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

The Trautonium is supposed to produce a complete undertone series.
Is this right?  I've also managed to get undertones on my TX81Z.
I don't have it here to check, but I think setting the modulator
to about a third above the carrier does the trick.  It sounds
Trautonium-like, but I don't know if there's a full undertone
series or not.

Are any of these software synthesizers about to go microtonal
capable of imitating a Trautonium?  Those I've seen so far are
either geared towards subtractive synthesis, or too complicated
for me to work out.  So, I'm sticking with my AWE64 and pitch
bends, waiting for a Sound Font retuning program.

As the Trautonium is a naturally microtonal instrument, with unique
harmonic possibilities, someone should really think of emulating
it on a PC.  I would do it myself, but I've got too much else to
get around to.
