''  An easy example to hear occurs when I practice singing the distinction

two intervals for five minutes or so, I find that the 6:5 starts having the
sensation I normally associate with 5:4.  "Sensation" in the sense that I'm
inclined to momentarily misidentify 6:5 as 5:4 - an auditory illusion in
essence.  And further, when I suddenly toss into the mix a 5:4, it startsseeming like a 4:3, and 3:2 seems like an octave. ''

I have heard similar stories from La Monte Young, for whom the 9:8 has come
to function as a boundary interval analogous to the 4:3 in classical
tetrachords, and from Morton Feldman, who claimed that his use of tightlypacked chromatic clusters had so changed his perception of intervals thatthe minor second was, for him, as perceptually wide as a minor third had
previously been.
