Subject: Re: Post from Brian McLaren

From: alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)

I would like to respond to some of Brian's good points about just
intervals, but before getting into specifics, I would like to talk about
the musical applicability of these studies. I would imagine that if you
asked subjects to state their "preference" between minor seconds and major
thirds, the thirds would be a near unanimous choice. Does this mean that
minor seconds should never be used in music?

Also, I don't think many people since the time of Helmholtz have claimed
that small-number ratios are the only criterion of consonance. Certainly I
have not. Consonance, in a musical sense as well as a strictly
psychoacoustic sense (if there is such a thing) is a very complex
phenomenon that depends on the ratio, on its relationship to the critical
bandwidth, on the relative timbres, the absolute frequencies, the loudness,
and, not least of all, the musical context.

Finally, as John Chalmers has pointed out, these studies are not without
their cultural biases. Though such biases difficult to test, given the
current ubiquity of twelve-tone equal temperament through radio and
television, I think that one is bound to show a "preference" for the
familiar. Some evidence for this comes from the article Brian quoted
earlier: Kessler, Hansen, and Shepard, "Tonal Schemata in the Perception of
Music in Bali and the West" (Music Perception, Winter 1984 V2/2, 131-165).

>[1] [Comparison of sqrt(3/2) to 45/32]

I personally find 45/32 much too high a ratio to be called "consonant," and
I don't really hear it as just. To take a fairer comparison, I do find 7/5
more consonant than a neutral third.

>[2] Tune up 11/9 and compare it to 9/8.  Which sounds more

This is true and illustrates my problem with a reliance on LCM analysis.
Because 9/8 is small and, depending on the absolute frequency, may lie
within the critical bandwidth, I find it relatively dissonant. I don't
think that the relative simplicity of the ratios are as much of an issue.

If one resolves the numbers here you have 4/3 and 5/3 in the first and 6/5
and 3/2 in the second. Based only on the ratios, I find 5/3 and 6/5
equivalent -- they are inversions of each other. That leaves 4/3 and 3/2.
Clearly 3/2 is the more stable because it lies lower in the harmonic
series.

>[4] Tune up the ratio 3:5:7 and then tune up the ratio 18:22:27.
>Which one sounds more consonant?

Here I have to disagree. While they both have distinctive sounds, I find
the 3/5 and 5/7 intervals more consonant than the 11/9 interval of the
second triad.

>This also sidesteps the dilemma of the just perfect fourth.

The dilemma of the perfect fourth is in part a historical artifact of
producing counterpoint by counting intervals relative to the lowest sound
voice (which for simplicity I'll call the bass). Thus the apparent
consonance of the perfect fourth and perfect fifth sounding together if one
only looks at them relative to the bass is taken care of by considering the
fourth dissonant. As is obvious to anyone looking at all the interval
combinations, the dissonance is not so much the fourth as the second
between the two upper voices.

The second reason for considering the fourth relative to the bass a
"dissonance" is to explain the need for the second inversion triad to
resolve. To me, this need for resolution is not so much because the 9:12:15
is "dissonant" as the simplest interval lies higher in the harmonic series
than either the octave or the perfect fifth. Therefore the chord sounds
less stable than one based on a 3/2. Also, some medieval musicians were not
bothered by this relative instability.

>Too, as Norman Cazden points out:

Using the stylistic conventions of one musical culture during one period of
history is a weak justification at best. The main reason behind the
prohibition of parallel perfect intervals was to maintain the independence
of the voices sought by European polyphonic composers of the 15th to 19th
centuries.

Parallel octaves causes the texture to suddenly thin because the octave
lies so low in the harmonic series -- which is why we tend to consider men
and women singing in parallel octaves virtually the same as monophony. Put
another way, the upper voices are doubling a harmonic already present in
the lower voices.

So, do we prohibit all parallel intervals, since they must be found in the
same harmonic series of some fundamental somewhere? Of course not. As we
move further up the harmonic series the impression of the two voices
operating "as a single unit" becomes less and less prominent. So where does
one draw the line? Perfect unison? Perfect octave? Perfect fifth? Perfect
fourth? Major third? Minor third? Well, composers of the 15th century chose
the draw the line between the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth.
Incidentally, it is interesting to note that 13th century motet composers
quite intentionally avoided parallel thirds, though parallel fifths and
fourths are often found.

I have nothing against composers who prefer the musical usefulness of equal
temperament or any other type of temperament. Nazir Jairazhboy, the Indian
music master quoted by Brian earlier, points out that he finds that
tempered intervals can give extra tension to a melody in need of
resolution. As Brian has pointed out as well, the Javanese find perfect 2/1
octaves rather lifeless and usually try to compress or expand them.

However, to say that there is some natural predilection for just,
equal-tempered, or any other kind of scale is, I think, to misunderstand
the relationship between nature and art. Certainly one would think Brian
would understand this, having composed in JI himself, according to John.
