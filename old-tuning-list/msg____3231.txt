Subject: Equal-beating chromatic scale
--
In vol. 29, No. 4 of the Journal of the
Acoustical Society of America, April
1957, A. L. Leigh Silver published an
interesting article called "Equal
Beating Chromatic Scale."
Silver appears to use a process of
successive substitution and iterated
fractions to generate a scale which he
claims produces equal beats for each
fifth. 
Silver notes that "A further disadvantage,
to which little attention has been paid,
is that when just and unjust intervals 
are mixed, the dissonances of the latter
are intensified by the comparison. If,
for example, an ET fifth is introduced
into a series of just fifths, it is 
recognized as an unjust interval more
quickly than when sounded alone."
[Silver, Al. L. L., "Equal Beating Chromatic
Scale," J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 29, No. 4,
April 1957, pg. 478]
Silver further points out that his EBS
is a circulating irregular temperament
but that "any deviations from ET are so
small that it may be argued that any 
advantage exists only in the imagination,
or in the realms of numerology. I am
of the opinion, however, that the numerous
small variations are accumulative and 
noticeable when combined in melody and
harmony." 
The Equal Beating Charomatic Scale has
the pitches:
A4 = 440 Hz
Ab4 = 415.16 Hz
G4 = 391.89 Hz
F#4 = 369.81 Hz
F4  = 349.13 Hz
E4 = 329.50 Hz
Eb4 = 311.12 Hz
D4  = 293.67 Hz
C#4 = 277.10 Hz
C4 = 261.59 Hz
B3 246.87 Hz
Bb3 = 233.09 Hz
A3  = 220.00 Hz
Silver further notes that "In my experience,
few tuner in this country (england) make a 
serious attempt to tune ET accurately and
any approximation that given twelve equally
usable keys is considered adequate."
