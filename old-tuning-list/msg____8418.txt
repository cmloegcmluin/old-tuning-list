Subject: Drew, the village idiot ! (XG tuning tables)

Damn, do I feel stupid.
In my defense, I'm new to the intricacies of MIDI, and I've
had the keyboard for less than a week.

Well, I'm the one that did the fudging: I didn't check !
It is Cents ! When I read all  that 1200/768 stuff, I assumed it meant
that Yamaha's tuning table divided the 1200 cent octave into 768 parts
of 64 steps each. Nyet ! Nein ! Non ! No ! 
The -64 to +63 are actual cents divisions, an octave divided into 1200
parts.
The PSR-530 only allows a maximum deviation of -63 to+64 cents,
with C#(-64) being equal to C(+36). I checked using

But, then I guess y'all knew this already. Sorry for the wasted
bandwidth.

Oh yeah, and I think I've figured out the Sysex for ALL the pitch
related 
XG parameters in the PSR-530. Either that or I wasted an hour playing
with
Bin,Hex,& Dec. no.s. I'll check today. Anyone who wants them, drop me
a line. 

Yeah, John L., you're right ( I just read your message).
