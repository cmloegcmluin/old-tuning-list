Subject: Music of Spheres -> Pi -> LucyTuning ?

From: Gary Morrison <MorriSonics@compuserve.com>

Something like a week ago or so, Charles Lucy said something that I've
been meaning to comment upon.  I apologize if, since I didn't save the
message, I am misquoting him, but he said something to the effect that,
"certainly if you're interested in a music of the spheres, pi is a natural
basis for the tuning of that music".  

   Charles, there's a term for that:  "Fuzzy thinking".  You're saying that
if music has something to do with spheres, spheres are related to the
number pi, then since LucyTuning has something to do with pi, clearly music
of the spheres implies the use of LucyTuning.

   That's conclusion is meaningless unless the relationship between pi and
spheres is the same as, or a clear consquence of, the relationship between
pi and LucyTuning.  If those two relationships bear no resemblance to one
another, then the mere fact that they both use the number pi is
uninteresting.  

   Are you equally prepared to suggest that LucyTuning must be rendered on
computers because LucyTuning's octaves bear power-of-two frequency
relationships to one another, and computers use a power-of-two place-value
(i.e., binary) number system?
