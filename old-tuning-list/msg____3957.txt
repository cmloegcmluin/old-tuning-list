Subject: Quartertone Piano

From: Jose Antonio Martin-Salin <101610.3043@CompuServe.COM>

Does any body know any information at all about quartertone pianos?

	I'm trying to get hold of a frame (to be possible for a ground one)
to build it. 

	Also, If I don't get hold of a frame, does anybody know where can I
cast a single one for a reasonable price?

	So far I haven't found anything at all in UK, maybe in Germany, USA,
or France???

	I have the support of the Music Technology department at the London
Guildhall University for this project, and the piano will be available for 
public performances in London. 

	The idea is to promote different alternative tunings, so it is more
likely to remain tuned to JI rather than 24ET

	Any suggestions wellcome!!!

Tony Salinas
