Folks:

Here at San Jose State Univ. the first thing we teach our freshmen  students in
 their theory courses are interval ratios. We need to build a monochord (obviou
sly!) I am the type who can't hammer a nail in the side of a barn - is there an
yplace I can go (on the net or elsewhere) to find a kit, model, plans, whatever
  My wife works in a violin shop so I can get pegs and bridges and such with n
o problem.  Thanks to anyone who can help.
