Subject: Scala bug fix release

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl

I have uploaded a new release of Scala which supercedes the
previous 1.4 version. It's at
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/pc/scala/scala14.zip
Note that the filename has changed from scala.zip to scala14.zip.
It's a release with only bug fixes and no new features.
The following problems are solved:

- PYTHAGOREAN/EQUALBEATS gives incorrect results if the octave is not 2/1.
- KEY makes the program end with an exception if the current scale is
empty.
- The EXAMPLE command has the following problems:
   1) When trying to use a different equal-command for each track,

0 track 1
0 equal 17
!!!
0 track 2
0 equal 19

     it says "invalid format : 0    track 1". Inserting a dummy
     equal-statement before the first track solves the problem.
   2) Empty lines in the input file can cause unpredictable results.
   3) Tempo statements with a time value of 0 (absolute or relative)
      make previous tempo statements with time 0 lost.
   4) Some enharmonic equivalent note names that are not in the same
      octave are not interpreted correctly, for example in 15-tET, B and C
      are equivalent, so B.0 = C.1 but instead B.0 is interpreted as C.0.
   5) Negative octaves with note names don't always work correctly for
      example: A.-2.
   6) A high amount of parameter statements can cause a program crash.
- EQUALTEMP/DATA can cause a program crash for divisions 0 till 4.

Scala supports it (but is not a MIDI patch/program editor), and the
EPS/EPS16/ASR10 tuning dump format. JIcalc supports them too.
