Subject: Re: Nonharmonic Overtone Structures

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I personally didn't get the impression that Paul E. contended that
nonharmonic overtone structures would not fuse into the effect of a single tone,
but Brian M. is definitely correct that they do.  

   If any of you who have heard Bill Sethares' tuning-optimized timbres can
clearly attest to that.  They're very interesting, by the way, and I encourage
you folks to explore them a bit if you haven't heard them yet.  But you
certainly don't have to go that far either.  Just listen to a bell or a marimba.


   Now Brian may be side-stepping one important point though:  Some of the more
wildly nonharmonic timbres can be difficult to nail down to a specific pitch.
Chimes and timpani seem at first to have a very clear pitch, but I find that
when I try to tune samples of those instruments to each other, I start having
problems.  Strangely, the more carefully I listen to them the less sure I am of
what exactly their pitch is.
