Subject: Meantone, Partch

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Re Meantone: "Linear" is an historical term (Ellis?) contrasting with
"cyclic" or closed. I agree that in general Meantone tone systems are 2-D,
but under the
common assumption of octave equivalence, the dimensionality may be reduced
to 1. In which case, both ET's and meantone tunings are generated by one
interval, the tempered fifth. Tempered systems are closed and have a finite
number N of
points on the line of fifths, while meantone are open and infinite. In this
sense they are "linear" and open as opposed to closed and cyclic.

BTW, Fokker used the idea of defining intervals in 2 and 3-D tones spaces
in a somewhat different way. He chose sets of "unison vectors," which he
set to 0, in 3x5 and 3x5x7 tone spaces to define temperaments as
"periodicity blocks" in the space. For example, the diesis and the syntonic
comma define a repeating block of 12 pitches as the area defined by the
absolute value of the cross product of the vectors describing these
intervals. (The box product is used for 3 intervals in 3-D space.) I
believe the concept can be extended to higher dimensions  by computing the
absolute values of the determinants of the square matrices whose row
vectors are the defining intervals. 
 
Paul Rapoport has also done much work in this area.

Wu"rschmidt, I believe, was the first to identify "defining intervals" for
tunings and to distinguish them from "constructing intervals," the
successive intervals of the JI scales corresponding to each of the ET's as
defined by this method (there are many possible sets of defining intervals
for any given ET and  there are many possible sets of 5 limit intervals
interpretable as 12-tet.)

Re Partch: HP's dual use of ratios to label scale degrees and to define
functions can be somewhat confusing at first as Marion has pointed out.
Partch assumed octave equivalence in deriving his theories, but did
recognize that inversions have different sounds and inn his music used a
variety of voicings.
Hence, sometimes 1/1 appears in the middle of a chord where the voicing
would indicate that the ratio should be 1/2, 2/1, 4/1 etc.

As for odd numbers (or factors) in the denominators, they determine the
roots of his otonal or harmonic series chords, though his term "numerary
nexus," has not caught on. They also indicate the harmonic distances from
the common tonic, the 1/1 (tempered G).  When HP writes 8/5 1/1 6/5, the
notation is a shorthand for  8/5 10/5 12/5  a major triad on the root 8/5,
a minor sixth above his 1/1 G. This notation makes the harmonic relations
clear, while somewhat obscuring the melodic movement and actual voicing.
Usually, he's clear enough as to the actual inversion and voicing.
Otherwise, he'd have to make the register explicit and increase the number
of symbols, e.g., 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, 8/3 etc. for
4/3 (roughly C) in various registers.. Such schematic spellings are not
unknown in conventional music theory.

For the subharmonic (utonal) chords, the odd factors in numerator serve the
same function. The Diamond diagram may clarify his meaning.

One really has to read Partch's theoretical sections as an introduction and
outline, not as a detailed composition manual.
