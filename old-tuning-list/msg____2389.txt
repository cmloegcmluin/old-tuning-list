Subject: A program for the optimization of 12 tone tunings

From: Jeff Welty <jwelty@wdni.com>

I hammered out a program this afternoon to optimize 12 tone tunings.

It is written entirely in C, and while it uses a routine from
numerical recipes (fortran edition), I believe it is not in violation
of any copyright laws to distribute the code.

What I have for input is a table of interval values desired (in terms
of frequency ratios), weights for those intervals, and also 12 note
weights.

The output is cents for each note, and a error table of intervals achieved
by the optimization minus the intervals desired.

If anyone is interested in this program I can mail the source code (365 lines).
and a sample input file.  It is still not user-friendly, so I'm really thinking
the best next step at this point is if someone would like to evaluate it
for potential use  and also just how good a job it does.

I'm still quite a newbie at this tuning stuff, so I'm sure I've missed something
somewhere on the internet, but it's at least been personally valuable for me up to now.
(actually only took 2 hours to throw the code together, already had the optimization
piece in another project).

Anyone interested?
