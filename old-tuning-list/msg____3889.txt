Subject: Re: Johnny's Lingua Franca Notation

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

How arbitrary are cents?  Surprisingly, not very.

Firstly, they are at the threshold of human hearing for pitch 
differentiation.

Secondly, allow total intellectualization of all pitch "points" on the 
line of frequency to be immediately apprehended.

History has done away with Savarts which are larger than cents
in favor a system which, thankfully, anchors on good old 12-tone ET (e.g. 
100 cents is a semitone, 200 cents is a whole tone, etc.)  Dare we admit 
that this is of value?

Amazingly, most musicians do not realize that the ear does not hear 
logarithmically.  It learns by rote.  For example, sing alound a 7/4 and 
then try to find the logarithmic midpoint that bisects the interval.  
Knowing this interval is made up of 969 cents, one can calculate a center.

If music is reduced to mathematics, why not cents?

Most important - players constantly reference new pitches to constants 
(like open strings, harmonics, etc.) in order to find exotics.  
Microtonal notations that represents moving relationships that lose their 
constants, make it difficult to come up with the necessary hand positions 
to produce the appropriate sounds.  It must relate.

No, Gary, you don't need to mix your tunings in a single piece.  But a 
player on an AFMM series will surely be alternating tunings from piece to 
piece on a single program.

Re: polymicrotonal compositions: perhaps just as their are conservatives 
and liberals, there will be those that want to stay safe and those that 
want to go outside.  I want to stay safe by composing intervals that I 
can "hear."  However a listener cares not what the laws of interaction 
are for the soup of pitches, only that they express something that 
transcends their experience.
