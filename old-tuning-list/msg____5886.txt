Which is my point: the composition articulates the material, not vice
versa.

In my first example, I gave chords and progressions without fifths, thus
the factor three was not represented and 9 was relatively prime to the
remaining tones.

This example was the single one where the composite reading of 9 was more=

likely to be understood than  and independent axis reading. Incidentally,=

one compositional alternative is to add a suspended ninth to the IV chord=

which is held through the V chord and then to voice the I without a fifth=

possibly suspending a ninth in the I as well. This is the best I can come=

up with as a way to articulate 'nineness' in such a fifth-oriented
environment. Perhaps someone else has a better idea... =
