Subject: Warning:  New 88CET Series Coming Up!

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

Well, seeing that the list is running a tad slow at the moment, I
decided that I probably ought to make good on my earlier threat to write a
short series of postings on the series of 88CET ear-training, notation, and
sight-singing practice CDs (CDRs actually) I made a while back.

   Why?  Well, so that you can recreate my 88CET ear-training CDs.  That
would obviously be a bit too narrow-minded a goal!  It's more to use those
CDs as an example to illustrate the sorts of considerations you folks
should ponder if you'd like to make ear-training CDs for whatever tunings
you're interested in.

   And it's also to promote the idea of that sort of CD, and to encourage
active ear-training practice, as a vital task in the study of unusual
tunings.

   I haven't written up the text of the postings yet, so it'll probably be
a couple days before I start getting going on them.  But it definitely
won't be too long.
