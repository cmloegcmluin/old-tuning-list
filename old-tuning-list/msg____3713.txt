I agree. Let me add my two cents. My experience with non-octave scales (and 
I'm still playing with them) is that although you can set up functional 
harmonic relationships and weird but beautiful melodies without octaves, 
once you "modulate" far enough to use an interval which is a near-octave, 
that won't sound like a distant harmonic relationship but like an 
out-of-tune version of the same note. The fact that we perceive pitch along 
a "helix" with the same notes repeating at every octave seems an unalterable 
property of our auditory system, and studies such as that of the "tritone 
paradox" demonstrate that cultural influences are built upon this framework, 
not vice versa. Anyhow, the acoustical octave, as Harry Partch pointed out, 
has a larger "sphere of influence" in the pitch continuum than any other 
interval (save the unison). Thus if a progression takes us to, say, 81/40, 
or even 63/32, the "gravitational pull" of the octave will be very strong 
and the implication hard to ignore. Randy Winchester's beautiful 
improvisations in the Pierce-Bohlen scale (13th root of 3) show how the 
near-octave can be used as a rough consonance, which however is not as 
stable as some of the purer-tuned consonances (like 7:1) and tends to 
resolve to them.
