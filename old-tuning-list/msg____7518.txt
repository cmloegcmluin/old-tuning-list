The only one I've seen (and the one I have) is published by Dover.
Based on the price you mentioned, I'd guess this is "it", and it
does have the additions by Ellis.

Helmholtz and Partch's "Genesis of a Music" were my main [and only]
references until very recently.  

I'm sure that there's tons of material out there, and those more
familiar with it will provide a bibliography, but based on what I
have, I'd suggest spending for a stack of Xenharmonicons [my personal
collection runs from #6 to the present].

As for "must haves", I'd definately recommend Doty's "The Just
Intonation Primer", available from the Just Intonation Network.
