Subject: Re: lap steel, bar slants and the surrogate kithara

I, too, have been a fan of pedal steel for a long time -- what a singing
instrument. Bob Lee has been very helpful to the list with his recent
postings, and it would be amazing to get more of the people here to take up
that beast also! A minor point regarding his last post:

"of sorts" is quite true: the instrument originally begat itself for the
sole purpose of performing some kithara parts that were too awkward to be
played on the outer courses of strings on the kithara itself -- hence,
"surrogate". The SK received perhaps some of the least acoustical attention
of any of the instruments, and ended up having parts written for it that
crossed the line between stringed (with the pitch-bending bars/rods) and
percussive (played with felted sticks).

No doubt with more resources the SK could have been more elegant; his
writing for what I would consider "lap guitar" is much more subtle and
reminiscent of pedal steel, and the "Eleven Intrusions" contain a good bit
of this. One other item is to note that Newband commissioned a newer SK to
be built (by an actual luthier, I believe) and though I haven't heard it in
person it could hardly be worse then the old one.

But Bob, answer me this: the SK was on a tripod stand with wheels, and when
you sat to play you could scurry all across the stage while executing the
part -- can this be done on any production model pedal steels?  :)

Best wishes to all for a happy solstice festivity of your choice!
Cheers,
Jon
