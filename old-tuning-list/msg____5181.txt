While I do agree that western Art musics have gone to extremes in this
direction, I think that there are plenty of examples of cultures where the
''unsingable'' is a constituent part of instrumental music, or more
precisely, where instrumental realizations of song become ''unsingable''.
The most virtuosic Mbira music is one example. Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese court musics often fall into this category with marked differences
between the sung and instrumental versions of a work; the legal limitations
on music making (e.g. forbidding melodies from exceeding a seventh) at
certain points in their histories certainly turned melodies into
''unsingable''. There are also instrumental traditions which are
constructed on relatively abstract bases (Balophone playing based on
patterns, the Balinese ritual 7-tone orchestras whose melodies are
extracted mechanically from the vowels of  texts).

The question of ''unplayable'' musics, on the other hand, is much more
complicated.  Perhaps from San Diego, John, you might be better able to
disambiguate what the Ferneyhoughites have in mind when notating a rhythm
that is impossible to perform accurately - do they want the failed
performance (a kind of improvisation on the composer's notation), or is
there an ideal performance which is to be eventually achieved? I suspect
that the general disinterest by the complexity folk in computer
realizations (a significant difference from Babbitt, by the way) indicates
that they are more interested in failure...

Could you perhaps be more specific about what you mean by ''unnatural
intervals''? (I assume that it requires mature and consenting pitches).
