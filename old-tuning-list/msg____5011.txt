And yet if you look at the derived fundamental frequency (defined below)
for the three bars I think that the "correct" interpretation is
undoubtedly F for the 1st and 3rd bars and C for the second.  This fits
quite naturally with the 7 ratios but not with your interpretation.
See http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-xmpl.htm for this Mozart
example and the Beethoven example mentioned below.

I certainly don't know enough about music history to argue on that score
and anyway accept that 16/9 is sometimes the correct value for that
note.  However I would argue on the basis of logic.  If you have a
dominant 7th chord and the other notes have frequency ratios of 4:5:6:8
why should the extra note be 64/9 in that ratio scheme when 63/9 would
cancel down nicely to 7 and make an elegant 4:5:6:7:8?   Whatever was
actually played historically I still feel that the intention or meaning
of such a chord is 4:5:6:7:8.

Oops, I really went to sleep on that one didn't I?  Two typos.
What I meant to say was that a minor 7th could be 7/4, 16/9 or 9/5.

I have to agree at the surprise, but believe that the results often tell
us more than we expected to find.

Have a look at my second example, Beethoven's "Romance".

The melody goes b c d g g g b g a b b g b c d but the fundamental
frequency       b c d g g g b c d g g g b c d is calculated.

(I define fundamental frequency as the frequency which has ratio 1 when
all the ratios are reduced to integers, so it divides all the played
frequencies).  To me it seems certain that the part with melody b g a
has been correctly interpreted because the fundamental frequency echoes
the other parts that go b c d.  Notice that the ratio 7 occurs in this
short passage several times and is necessary to give this beautiful
structure.

Actually I cheated a wee bit, because one of those b's is actually an
incidental b/a.

Thanks for the information about Csound.  I will access this.

I accessed all your pages and there was only one missing graphic.
Unfortunately when I went to gets its name I hit the wrong key and lost
it all.  You already saw above how butterfingered I was that night from
my typing :-)   If I find this again I will let you know.

Robert, thanks for the interesting comments, Ray.
