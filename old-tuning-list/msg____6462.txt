Subject: Carl's opinion on FPI tuning

From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com>

That's Free Pitched Instruments.  And, if you only had to read one thing
about my opinion on tuning them, Hstick says it best!

Bingo!  If we had the conservatories filled with Xenharmonic keyboards and
theory classes, then we have ensembles using Xenharmonics in a very
effective way (as opposed to doing it by accident, as they do now).

I don't know as much about clarinets, but I've played the trumpet for many
years.  And trumpet players are notorious "equipment freaks", so I am always
up on the latest stuff.  But when it comes down to it, trumpets are just
three natural horns in a small package.  Thus, playing the harmonic series
is easy as can be -> When you hear an arpegio, you can bet it's Just.

I've got two top-of-the-line professional Bb horns, a Bach Stradivarius with
72 bell and a Yamaha ML heavy-wall.  And I've played many different
configurations of the above.  I can personally say, and it is well known,
that the intonational characteristics vary widely from horn to horn of the
same make and config, let alone different makes and configurations.

As far as what intonational 'model' the builders shoot for, they must be
torn between good harmonic characteristics and 12equal approximations.  The
Yamaha tends to pull towards the 12 equal in the high register, but is just
plain out of tune in any system in the low range.  The Bach tends to be more
harmonic throughout, and the tone is plainly warmer to the most novice listener.

But either horn will intone however my conservatory-trained friend wants it
to, once he's had a few minutes to get to know the pet peeves of it.

The bottom line is: I'm all for new instrument design of any kind.  But I
can only see biasing free pitched instruments to equal temperaments as the
exception (say, for keyboard concertos) rather than the rule.

And the real bottom line is just what Hstick says.

Carl
