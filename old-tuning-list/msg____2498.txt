Abstract of the Project Paper

A Study of the Tonal Systems of Harry Partch, Ben Johnston, Josef Yasser,
and Easley Blackwood

by

Matthew Davis Puzan

        This study presents a compendium of data on four of the most viable
theories on microtonality available today. This includes detailed
descriptions of four proposals on how our current system of twelve note
equal temperament can be expanded to a greater number of notes per octave,
and on what sort of instruments music composed in such new tunings may be
performed. Further, this study demonstrates how these new intonations can
be accurately notated. None of these four theories is in itself complete or
foolproof. The reader must compare, edit, synthesize, and redefine these
ideas. The development of a personal thesis allows one to fill in a more
complete description of the process of composition with microtones. Thus,
the goal of this study is to provide the reader with the necessary
information which would allow the informed selection of those elements
needed to begin the development of a process of composing in an expanded
tonality.
        This paper is organized as follows: Part 1-Tuning Systems. Two
systems of extended just intonation and two systems of extended equal
temperament are described and evaluated; Part 2-Instruments. Many new
instruments have been constructed as well as modification or adaptation of
traditional instruments have taken place in order to accommodate various
extended tonalities. Four different approaches are examined; Part
3-Notation. Four proposed systems for notating a more discrete tonality
than 12-note equal are evaluated;  Part 4-Conclusions. These four major
sections are followed by a glossary of microtonal terms and a bibliography.
