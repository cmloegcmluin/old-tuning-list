Subject: SF Vacuum Tree Head performance.

From: ribarbe@garlic.com (Atlas Eclipticalis)

Vacuum Tree Head, a modern alternative to music ensemble, will be
performing in San Francisco.  These are pretty rare performances, and I
encourage you all to come up and see us play.  We use a variety of tunings,
from 12t to random noises pulled out of the cosmic hat.  For more intense
details, see the home page: http://garlic.com/~ribarbe/vth
