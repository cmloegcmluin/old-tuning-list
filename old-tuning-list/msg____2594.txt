Subject: Comments on XH 16

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

I finally received my copy of XH 16 a couple weeks ago and just finished
reading through it a few days ago -- good stuff!  Hopefully, I'll have more to
say on some specific articles in subsequent posts. But first, a few comments on
John C.'s Notes & Comments section, specifically regarding mention of my XH web
pages:

1) My e-mail address has changed to xen@tiac.net (as should be obvious from the
   return address to this posting).  Any mail sent to my old address
   (pusey@remqhi.enet.dec.com) will either be lost or rejected outright.

2) The XH web pages are still at the same URL
   (http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/xh.html). In addition to the Tables of
   Contents for all issues of XH, there is also an Author Index and a Title
   Index for all articles. I recently updated these pages to include all the
   articles in XH 16.

3) As John C. mentions, I will be adding errata sheets for XH as they are
   submitted. However, as of this posting, I have not received *any* errata
   submissions -- not even from John C. (hint, hint).

4) Finally, John C. alludes to a glossary of xenharmonic terminology that I am
   planning to include on my web site.  I've been working on this off and on
   for well over a year now, but it is definitely a back-burner project.
   However, with sufficient prodding I will eventually release it for public
   consumption.

John
