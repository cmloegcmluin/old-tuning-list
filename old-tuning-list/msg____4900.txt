Yes, this bears repeating because I really believe it is true:

Pieces in minor tended to end with a Picardy (major tonic) chord in the days 
when the minor triad was tuned 10:12:15. When the tuning became much closer 
to 16:19:24, it became ok to end on a minor triad. I claim, because I hear 
this (maybe it's just difference tones, maybe not) that this is due to that 
fact the the fundamental of 16:19:24 is octave-equivalent to the root, 
establishing a more stable sonority. The distinction between the two chords 
is enough to give them a different nature, both useful, while the 
distinction between a just and an equal-tempered major triad is merely that 
the former is smoother than the latter. So JI composers might have little 
use for two versions of the major triad (4:5:6 vs. 1/24:1/19:1/16), while 
relishing the distinctions between 10:12:15, 16:19:24, and also 6:7:9.

let me add "of melodies that exceed a perfect fourth in range" to the above. 
Also, I said important, I didn't mean necessary, I meant helpful.

In the West, these modes (which I love using and talking about; don't forget 
the harmonic major scale) arose in the era of triadic harmony. The melody 
has deferred to the harmony. I guess that just proves your point, doesn't 
it? Well, I still think there is room for an "unaccompanied melody" 
aesthetic in harmonic music. More on this later.

Modes like these and even more complex ones arose in the Middle East and 
India, though. However, the modes which do exhibit some tetrachordal 
similarity are considered more basic in these cultures. They use altered 
modes as a means of achieving the musical depth and variety for which the 
West relies on harmony. Sometimes I really prefer the purely melodic 
approach, and find classical modulatory contrivances boring. Other times 
there is nothing more breathtaking or subtlely beautiful that a 
well-conceived modulation.

A severe violation of Occam's razor!

Well, I don't see a single pitch that would have to be different, but if you 
meant I-V-I, yes, you're correct.

So you're saying that even if the melody really stands up on its own, 
different harmonizations may produce different pitch inflections in the 
melody. That may be so in slow tempi, but it must be recognized that if the 
melody is the basis of the composition, these inflections do not represent 
different pitch classes but just acoustically favorable dispositions of some 
pitch classes. The melody should have a description, in terms of slighlty 
mutable pitch classes, that reflects the fact that it is the same melody 
regardless of harmonization. If you treat the different JI dispositions of a 
given pitch class as different pitch classes, your analysis of thematic 
development in common-practice works would end up reaching ridiculous 
conclusions, since a downward drift is so common in JI realizations of the 
repertoire. The home key is the home key, not a key seven commas flat.

This is why I love meantone tuning. It is almost as pure as JI, and you 
don't have to worry about any of this! Unfortunately, dominant sevenths are 
rather ugly in meantone, so it's better for Monteverdi than for barbershop. 
Augmented sixth chords in meantone are great barbershop sevenths, though!

Recent data I have seen on barbershop singing points to major thirds of 
around 397 cents (string players average around 405 cents), but plenty of 
flattened minor sevenths. It appears musicians are unwilling to lessen the 
degree to which tendency tones "lean" to their target from the 
equal-tempered standard, but are quite willing to increase this leaning when 
the results are acoustically favorable. In any case, understanding the fact 
that the

Helmholtz, as Ellis attests, was more interested in proving his theories 
than making objective measurements. He was a genius of natural physics, but 
music is not a natural phenomenon.
