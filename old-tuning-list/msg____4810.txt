So far you have only followed this up with questions. I'm
waiting to see your better model. I hold that real strings 
have partials which are nearly but not exactly harmonic.
It's up to you to show that this is not so, and that the
proper model is built on the value pi, and that this 
justifies your tuning system for plucked and hammered 
string instruments, and that this justifies your tuning 
system for other instruments.
