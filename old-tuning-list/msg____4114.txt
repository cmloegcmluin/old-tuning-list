Subject: Partch letters

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

In case anyone finds this interesting, I have found a thread of
correspondence between Harry Partch and Virgil Thomson (and Otto Luening)
in the Thomson archive at Yale.  It is comprised of twelve letters, most of
which are attempts and thank-yous for meetings in New York and exchanges of
"the manuscript", which is most likely a pre-publication hand-typed
_Genesis_ (the letters date from 5 October 1942 to 21 October 1943, plus
two in September/October 1953 which thank Thomson for publishing a review
of Oedipus and sending a gift of "Plectra and Percussion Dances."  His copy
of the exposition was apparrently the only one, yet Partch lent it out with
little hesitation.)  The intent of these letters are to pave to way for
reccommendations for a Guggenheim fellowship, which Partch indeed attained
in March 1943.

If anyone is interested in these letters, please feel free to contact me
for more details.
