I spoke with one of the better tuners in Frankfurt today. It seems that
chamber music players can range from 435 to 442, western German orchestras
and new music groups are at 442/443 and eastern orchestras (include the
Berlin Phil) are up around 444/445.  Early music groups are all over the
place (although 415 and 440 have the largest following), but most pop and
commercial recording is done at 440 (if they wish to push the pitch they go
ahead and transpose). 

I hesitate to subscribe to Ray Tomes' extraction of pitches from naturally
occuring frequencies (which do vary - sometimes in regular patterns, but
often eccentrically - from the values he gives(most reference books give
rounded-off values, anyways)), but La Monte Young's pragmatic use of house
current frequencies does have something to recommend itself (even if he
does have to modulate when he crosses the ocean).

It is curious that Tomes claims a fixed pitch for Ni. Besides the fact that
singers and instrumentalists vary widely in their choice of Sa (I have
heard everything from (in terms of 440A) G to Eb with C# the most frequent
), Ni can have several levels and would seem, from a musical-functional
viewpoint, to be an odd choice for a pitch standard.
