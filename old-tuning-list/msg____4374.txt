Thanks Carter for describing a useful technique which at least wasn't
obvious for me.

The answer is yes. One can easily determine this with Scala. Do
   load partch_43
   show transpose
It shows how many notes are different for each transposition. Look at
the second amount which shows how many are different regardless of
degree order. If we take Brian's upper limit of 17 notes per channel
then we are looking for a transposition with about 43-17& notes
different. Candidates are 7 and 12 with 25 and 14 with 27. Let's take
7 (10/9). Then we do 
   copy 0 1
   key 7
   intersect 1
   show/line
and we get this scale
 81/80 21/20 16/15 11/10 9/8 6/5 9/7 4/3 27/20 7/5 3/2 8/5 18/11 27/16 12/7
 16/9 9/5 2/1
Midi channel 1 then gets a pitch bend of 10/9 182.4 cents.
With some more manipulation we determine which pitches still have to
be done: 
 33/32 12/11 8/7 14/11 21/16 11/8 16/11 32/21 11/7 7/4 11/6 64/33
That's only twelve, with one note per channel there would be enough
channels left. Some can be grouped together like the ones with 11 in
the numerator, another group with 11 in the denominator, etc. But how
to get a minimum amount of channels in general could indeed be 
somewhat tedious. If you settle for a smaller range than that of the
piano it can be less.
