Many thanks to Jonathan Wild for such a fine posting, which has brought 
the thread, I would imagine, near to a consensual close. I'll confess I 
was feeling a little guilty at having addressed only Paul Erlich's 
general statement about Greeks and irrationals, without moving on to 
their treatment of music, where, for the reasons Jonathan has given, 
irrationals were indeed shunned. I would still maintain, of course, that 
if the Greeks had broken their quadrivial constraints, and tried to 
reinterpret Aristoxenus in terms of irrational equal divisions, the 30th 
root of 4/3 would have been by far the most likely choice of a basic 
unit. The fact that when this break was eventually made, in the 16th 
century, Aristoxenus was taken to be the father of 12TET, reflects the 
needs of Renaissance theorists, and not those of Greek antiquity. 
Aristoxenus was needed as a precedent, to justify the abandonment of 
numerus sonorus dogma; without citing a precedent, these ideas could, in 
the intellectual environment of the times, have been summarily 
dismissed. Renaissance theorists were therefore primarily interested in 
the use that could be made of Aristoxenus to serve their purposes; the 
truth of their interpretation of Aristoxenus was only a secondary 
consideration.
