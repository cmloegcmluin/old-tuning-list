Subject: Chord periods

Not a lot of trouble, actually.  I used my excel 
spreadsheet and just typed =lcm( and then selected 
some cells with the mouse.  The spreadsheet did the 
rest.  It's quite convenient for doing JI music 
calculations.  It does gcd too.

I confess, I suspected something would cancel out, 
but I didn't have the time to go into it just then and 
simplify.  Thanks for saving me the trouble.

I do think this representation makes the concept 
clearer, but without more feedback I won't know.

I intend to write a chord sorting program based on 
this principle when I can find the time, and do some 
compositions, but free time is in mighty short supply 
for me just now.
