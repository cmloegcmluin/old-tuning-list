My definition is not overbroad, it is quite strict:

A tonic is established from

In the most familiar tonal repertoires, the fixed collection establishes
tonic/dominant relationships clearly so that common tones between such
chords will not be heard as puns. A pun will be heard when the ear requires
some reorientation, that is when the membership in the collection has been
altered in some way.

Think of it this way: the collection consists of those (usually) closely
related pitches accessable during a given time span in some music. A
temporal pun occurs when a single pitch from an initial collection is now
heard in terms of new collection. Expressed in of just intonation, _any_
such pun will envolve collections upon the same lattice, and puns can be
composed at _any_ distance on the lattice.

It is true that when the collection is ignored the function I describe is
identical for common tones in a tonic-dominant pair and for a more exotic
interval pair, the function alone is insufficient to make a pun. A pun must
be supported by some musical form of ''syntax'' that supports both
interpretations, or it will not be heard as a pun. For that reason, it has
to be framed in terms of distinct operative collections of pitches. I
assume that I needn't note that the effectiveness of an intonational pun
depends upon the identity of this function with that founds in familiar
modulations or chord changes; the difference is not strictly one of degree
- i.e. distance on the lattice - but of context.    

This might be positively contrasted with a pitch-saturated music like
Princetonian serialism, where 12 tone aggregates are the basic collections.
In such a music, the lack of content distinctiveness among collections
leads to a situation where all the puns fall flat. (Although intervallic
diversity may create very different lines - or lynes, as they would have it
- in the end all of them map onto the same set of pitches).
