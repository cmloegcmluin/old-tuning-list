Subject: Re: Stainless Steel Frets

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

The only stainless steel frets I have seen are SS rods in Chapman sticks 
and Busley matrices (stick like doubleneck on a stand). The Gittler 
guitar also used stainless steel rods. I suspect that the reason 
stainless steel fret stock is unavailable is that luthiers don't want to 
have to do fret mills with carbide bits.

BTW, visit this beautifully done microtonal site
