Subject: Microtonal concert in Toronto

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

During a recent visit to the music department at SUNY, Buffalo, I attended 
a concert of microtonal music in Toronto with Paul Rapoport, Gayle Young, 
(the editor of Musicworks), her husband Reiner (a sculptor), and John 
Cuciurean, a graduate student of John Clough's. The performance was by 
"Critical Band," a group lead by John Gzowski (pronounced Zosky) that 
plays homebuilt instruments in 19  and 31-tets as well as using the 
harmonic series and empirical pitches.   
 
John Gzowski's principal instrument was constructed as a longish and
rather wide fingerboard strung with 10 strings and fretted for 31-tet. 
It was electrified and rested on stand coupled to a space-frame with 
another 40 or so resonating sympathetic strings. John also played an 
19-tet electric guitar. He said that he had used fretting kits purchased 
from Mark Rankin to construct these instruments. 
 
Other novel instruments included a rotationally symmetrical Kalimba 
(Cylimba?) played by plucking or bowing metal tongues, and two instruments 
made from large dowels marked for the  harmonic series and strung with 
about a half-dozen metal strings. They might be described as electric 
tube zithers, though they were mostly bowed as I remember. 
 
There was also a self-excited, free-form soundboard (called the Clusterflux, 
which was strung with a large number of metal strings, studded with magnets 
and pickups, and electrified. The current flowing through the strings heats 
them, causing them to change pitch. After it had played by itself for a 
few minutes, Marc and a clarinetist joined in playing harmonic series on various fundamentals. 
 
Supplementing this armamentarium was a battery of found metal objects, 
large clay pots, and sound sculptures such as a pair of electrified hedge 
shears, which were played with great verve and concentration by another 
member of the ensemble. Another instrument appeared to be part of an
automobile exhaust system with attached wires.
 
The performers included the violinist Marc Sabat, a clarinetist, and
two other musicians. Unfortunately, I did not get their names or the
names of all of the instruments as there were no programs and I forgot
to take notes. Marc Sabat subscribes to this List, so perhaps he will
post more information and correct any errors I have made.
 
The music tended to be rather dense, sometimes obscuring the character 
of the non-12 tunings. This might suggest that timbre rather than pitch relations is Gzowski's primary interest at this time. A duet, however, 
by Marc and John for violin and 19-tet guitar was lovely. I would 
certainly like to hear more from Critical Band. It's a pity that Toronto 
is so far away from California, they'd be ideal for the Sonic Arts Gallery 
and similar West Coast venues.
