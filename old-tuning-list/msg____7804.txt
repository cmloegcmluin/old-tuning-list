Subject: tetrachords

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Here's a question which I was originally going to post privately to 
Chalmers, but thought I'd air it out here for maximum response; why are 
scales formed by tetrachords in the first place? I've read about them for 
many years, and all of a sudden I realized that I don't know the 
fundamental reason behind their origin. Any thoughts are surely 
appreciated....thanks...Hstick
