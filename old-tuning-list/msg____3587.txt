Difficult.  Certainly NOT a theoretician.  Hardly a musician;
something of a composer,

Including juvenalia yes, but all recent works are scored in a
computer, and they only total 11m 40s, and there is 4 mins of the
current work in progress written.  Total of 8mins performed in public.

Of the 8 mins, 7mins are in 100ET and the remaining 1m work is on a
single note (333Hz -- no idea what that means for scale!)
