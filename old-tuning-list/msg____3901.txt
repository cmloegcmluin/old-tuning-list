Bill Sethares, in the manuscript for his up-coming book, describes a detailed
study of levels of discord.  I think the study was conducted by Plomp and Levelt
(or something like that - I don't have the reference in front of me).  

   But anyway, two factors strike me as especially significant about Bill's
approach:
1.  It builds from experimental results that strike me as hard to believe, but
    I'm 90% confident are due to the fact that the experimenters used 
    sinewaves (their "dissonance" curve looked somewhat like the integral of
    a typical bell-curve if you can imagine that), and
2.  Bill uses this seemingly unrealistic set of experimental results with 
    sinewaves, to form what is almost certainly the most complete, accurate,
    and practical approach to the meaning of "consonance" and "dissonance" 
    (the latter more accurately being called "discord").  
Along the first lines - surprising conclusions of the indepth experimental study
- it concluded that minor ninths and major sevenths are about as consonant as
octaves.  I find that difficult to swallow even with sinewaves.  I have a
preconceived notion that major sevenths and minor ninths have to be
comparatively discordant in ANY timbre.  I have to confess that, based upon his
accompanying tape, it could well be that my preconceived notion in that regard
is at least partly false.  

   But anyway, I'm about 98% certain that what I'll find as I read further, is
that he'll attribute the discord of major sevenths and minor ninths absolutely
100% to a "rough" (fast) beat between the second harmonic of the lower tone with
the fundamental of the higher tone.  That suggests that half-wave symmetrical
tones (no even harmonics) will not produce discordant M7s and m9s, which again
strikes me as counterintuitive.  

   But the undeniable fact of the matter is that Bill's techniques and ideas
absolutely DO work.  That in turn seems to make it hard to deny that what I
described above is indeed a case of preconceived notions.
