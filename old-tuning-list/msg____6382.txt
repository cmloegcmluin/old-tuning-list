Subject: A re-introduction, and a sampler Q

From: Steven  Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov>

Hello again to everyone on the tuning list.

For those of you who remember me, I'm back, at least temporarily.

For those who don't, I'm a bass player (or at least trying to be :)
who also has an interest in alternate scales an tunings.  I've yet to
accomplish much, other than coming to some basic aural understanding
of some of the theoretical stuff, but I've done quite a few
experiments, (and learned quite a bit under the masterful instruction
of list members), and for the time being, I'm content exploring 22TET
using Paul E theories, and prodding around in 7 limit JI.  Musically,
I haven't evolved to the point of having a style yet; I pretty much
just mess around with grooves and rythmic harmony, unless I'm jammin'
the blues. ;-)

In addition to my basses, I also keep a couple of "economy" guitars
(22 TET) around, and have the requisite set of bongos, as well as
a hammered dulcimer and an Emu retunable synth.  Within a couple
of months, I expect to have added to my collection a sampler and
a Zendrum percussion controller, which brings me to a question for
you all:

I've just about narrowed down my choice of samplers to two, based on
budget (though it's still going to be a stretch), and features I think
I'd need to be able to set up [xen]tuned percussive instruments,
namely the Yamaha A3000 and the Emu ESI4000.  [I was looking at an
Akai MPC too, but just found out its tuning resolution is rather
atrocious]. If anyone has experience with either of them, or anything
for that matter, I'd love to hear it, positive or negative, especially
as it might relate to doing alternate tuning "work".  TIA for any
thoughts.

It's nice to be back, and I'm hoping that I'll find time to catch up
with some of the discussion that's been going on.

Steve
