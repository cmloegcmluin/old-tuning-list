Subject: Robert Erickson

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I am sorry to report that the composer and author Robert Erickson died 
Thursday, April 24 in Encinitas, CA after a very long illness that keep him 
bedridden for most of the last 15 years. Mr. Erickson  was sympathetic to
tuning experiments and wrote an insightful article on Archytas's tunings 
to which I referred in my book and which has recently been published. 
He used a variety of natural and instrumental sounds in his music,
including
new instruments based on  metal rods stroked to excite longitudinal rather 
than transverse vibrations. 

He was one of the founding members of the Music Department at UCSD. 
According to the obituary in the Saturday San Diego Union-Tribune, a 
memorial service is still in the planning stage. In lieu of flowers, 
donations to The Friends of Music are suggested. More information 
may be obtained by calling (619) 534-4830.
