I don't think we need to worry about that. The limit of what is allowed
is normally thought of as allowed. Limit is already very widespread in
the literature.

I agree, though, that many people automatically think of prime limit in
many cases where odd limit would be more appropriate. I was thinking
about putting together a (Web) document on this and one or two people
agreed with me but it went no further. Any interest, Kraig?
