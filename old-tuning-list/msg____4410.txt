RTQE 12/22/96 - SPECIAL: Beyond Equal Temperament I: Traditional Values

This evening's RTQE is a follow-up to November's broadcast of LaMonte
Young's "The Well Tuned Piano," in which we begin a series of occasional
programs of musics outside of 12-tone Equal Temperament. Tonight, we're
doing the "traditional values" thing by praising those hardy exemplars
who made interesting music and influenced a generation of interesting and
idiosyncratic contemporary composers (who you'll get to hear in the
*next* installment).
