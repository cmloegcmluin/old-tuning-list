Subject: Tibetan tunings, etc.

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

The Chinese year cycle named as "dog," "pig," "rabbit,"
etc. is neither more nor less rigid than our own American
convention inherited from the English.  Other Europeans
(e.g., Italian "trecento" for thirteen hundreds) are more
sensible, but the nineteen hundreds  _do_  comprise
the twentieth century after Jesus's teaching.

I am not a magical fundamental "Christian," but still it
seems true to me that Jesus's teachings are amongst the
best wisdom the West has produced, and I see no objection
to gauging a calendar from the approximate time that he taught.

It's all relative, and it's all arbitrary.

Buddha was perhaps more adroit with that particular
problem than Jesus was.

It might seem absurd to put a Tibetan scale on a Kurzweil,
because no one can play a Kurzweil the way one plays a bell,
and no one is expected to -- they are different instruments
generically.  Nevertheless, I think there is no harm
in adapting Tibetan ideas to a rather fixed instrument.

It's important to remember that we are producing a new music,
_not_  Tibetan music.
