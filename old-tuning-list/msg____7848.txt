Subject: Re: Just Intonation-Specific MailingList

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

I don't think it's generally a good idea to break up this list.  As
long as there's a huge body of standardised instruments and thought
patterns in 12-equal, we all face similar problems.  I don't see
why what would be interesting to just intonationists wouldn't also
be to other tuning fans.  Questions on what do to with the comma
also arise in 22 and 41 equal, and so on.

I would like a mailing list devoted to the links between music and
mathematics.  There are a lot of threads on this list that drift off
topic, and some people who don't like the maths.

Otherwise, if tuning is going to be segregated, I suggest it be
along these lines:

Historical Tunings -- meantone, well temperament, the Bach chestnut

Practicalities -- instrument building, synth tuning

Quintal Scales -- attempts to improve the tuning of triadic harmony

Higher Prime Scales -- just or otherwise, the same issues arise

Non-Harmonic Scales -- with no explicit link to integer ratios

Most threads would fit neatly under one of those topics.  However,
a lot of interesting topics wouldn't be possible if the just
intonationists were in one camp and the temperers in another.


There is a lot of stuff on JI on the Web, and a page indexing it
all would be welcome.

I don't think moving to the Usenet is a good idea.  This list works
extremely well -- no noisy flame wars or anything like that.  Don't
change a winning formula!
