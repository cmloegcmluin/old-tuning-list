   Thanks, Brian!

   Actually, I wouldn't mind Brian reviewing my (88CET) music in public.
Perhaps he's refering to the fact that I asked him not to duplicate the tape?  

   Anyway, both of those statements go for others of you who have received
copies of my 88CET demo.  You're welcome to review my 88CET demo on this forum,
and I also ask you not to copy it.  Stan Hoffman, Randy Winchester, Steve
Curtin, and several others have given me some very useful constructive criticism
along areas that I hadn't considered.  So thanks to all of you as well.  

   Here's something else I'd love to hear what you folks have to say about, if
anything:

   Perhaps the most important thing I've learned from their constructive
criticism is that attempting to simulate "very convincing orchestral wind and
percussion ensembles" (to use Brian's words), is a risky business.  Our ears are
VERY picky about classical music.  It's kind of like discussing which is the
better violinst between Guidon Kramer and Itzak Perlman:  Violinists can debate
that question for hours on end, but the undeniable truth of the matter is that
they're both excellent.  So when an electronically synthesized violin
performance comes along, it's just not even on tens-of-parts-per-million kind of
scale (puns intended of course) we normally use to evaluate classical
performances.  Not even CLOSE!  That even though, in the big picture, it could
be 95% of the way up the naturalness scale with Itzak Perlman at the top, and a
1968-vintage Moog at the bottom.  

   Or as I'm fond of putting it, when you move from analog and FM synthesis, to
physical modeling, sampling, or additive synthesis, you find that your
instrument simulations ... improve (?) ... from impressive imitations to what
sound like ungodly hideous real instruments!  

   Any thoughts, anybody?  

   And my reviewers have pointed out another very amusing risk in attempting the
simulate classical ensembles - one especially relavant to xenharmonic
realizations:  Traditional timbres carry a strong weight with them.  One
reviewer (perhaps I ought not mention names) pointed out that my "Night and Day"
(scored for flute quartet, trumpet, three horns, bass trombone, and percussion)
felt a lot like listening to Junior High School orchestra performance, because
it contained a lot of out-of-tune notes on orchestral instruments!  (Or at least
reasonably good simulations of them.)  If it were on abstract electronic timbres
instead that sort of image would never have come up.  Along similar lines,
another reviewer wasn't sure whether to take my short 88CET fife, drum, and
bugle corps piece, called A Different Drummer, for the cute little scherzo I
intended it to be, largely because it was rendered on serious-sounding
instrument simulations, in a militaristic style.  

   Any thoughts on that?
