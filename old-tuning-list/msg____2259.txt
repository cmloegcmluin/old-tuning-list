   Yeah, I tried that.  He complained that E-mail would consume too much of his
time - as if E-mail were any different from TV or time spent with friends in
that regard.  He doesn't seem to realize that E-mail is something that must, but
can, be balanced along with everything else in our lives.  

   He also thinks that answering machines (by which I mean leaving messages on
one) are "an instrument of the devil" (direct quote spoken fecetiously).  

   I personally would prefer that John and the rest of us refuse to post his
messages until he's ready to enter the modern world.  The attitude partly comes
from it being so difficult to collaborate with him on the Ivor Darreg Memorial
Fund's CD projects because of that.
