The funny thing is, I wasn't taking this at face value -- I found myself
assuming that if the Indians really liked the piano harmonies on their
music, they would have listened to it, rather thatn drumming so loudly
that the piano could not be heard. I assumed they were trying to cover
that awful sound up, and was amused at the missionary's pianocentric
misinterpretation. The thirteenth century people 'shuddering in the
doorways' of Notre Dame are open to the same kind of interpretation. Not
that I don't love harmony and polyphony...
