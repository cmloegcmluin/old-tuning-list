In response to Carter's post regarding addresses, at this time I do 
not have everyone's address...sorry. Those wanting to sell CD's should 
probably let it be known. Again, in case anyone missed it, please send 
about $27.00 for shipping costs, along with your address, and I'll get 
your CD's out at once...Hstick
