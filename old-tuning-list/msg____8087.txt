Subject: Pythagorean tuning site and FAQ

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Margo Schulter has just put up a WEB site devoted to
the tuning of early music. Her FAQ on Pythagorean tuning
and harmony is superb. It also describes meantone and 12-tet
from the point of view of medieval music.

See http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html.
