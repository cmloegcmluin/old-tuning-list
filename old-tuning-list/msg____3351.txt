   I can't vouch for having experienced this effect, except through the benefit
of Bill Sethares' 88CET-optimized timbres.  Other people experimenting with
88CET have found its off-octaves to be more usable musically than I have.  I
pretty much just plain avoid them, but I can imagine how somebody can find use
for them in a few cases.  But, except through Bill's mapped timbres, I haven't
heard of the octave-duplicating effect having survived the extremity of detuning
that 88CET imposes.  Any perspective from you 88CET experimenters (with
near-harmonic timbres)?  Warren, John P., Paul F.?

   My composition entitled "Night and Day" (which has received mixed reviews),
pitted very traditional harmony in 88CET against its more native nontraditional
resources.  The traditional harmony was exceptionally difficult to realize
because only a handful of the voicings that you'd expect to be freely available
through octave-displacement, were actually available.
