Dear Tuning,

Sorry! In case I confused anyone : of course I meant the Kingma
(Osten Brannen) flute, not a simulation of a flute using Kyma (the
digital platform).

I seem to have confused Johnny! ;-)

No! you mean there's a learning curve to learning an instrument!?
Well I'll be darned....  and you've got to memorise! well, I didn't
understand the relevance of that before!;-)

Agreed - up to a point....but.... Last night there was a performance
of Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe on BBC Radio.  And I thought to myself:
there's no way that something of this nature could be brought off
with conventional existing instruments, if it was composed in, say
32-ET (which can give, for example, a glorious mix of Western and
Eastern harmony...).  No way.  The thing would be completely fudged,
even if it were a whole orchestra of superstars... Ok, maybe you
could do it after 5 years of rehearsals...

But perhaps I 'harp' on....

All best,

Patrick Ozzard-Low
