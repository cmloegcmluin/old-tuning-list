Subject: Ya gotta have halls

From: A440A@aol.com

Greetings all, 

     I have been asked by the architects at the school to help in the design
of the new  concert hall.  I am woefully unequipped to do this, so have
offered instead to perhaps locate a hall of similar size that is held in good
regard.  

     Where are the really good 500-600 seat recital halls in this country?
 It is important that the hall be suitable for a music school, i.e.,  all
kinds of instruments and voice, plus piano.   

     I would appreciate any suggestions.  They may send me to look at some of
these,  so I would like to start with recommendations from those possessed of
the critical listening (thus the addresses on this mini-spam). The tuning
list can delve into such small increments of musical scale, surely that is a
group of people that really listen.  Likewise the piano tech crowd,  where do
all you professional ears think the really good sounding halls are?

Thanks,
