   If you were painting that painting, with only three-colors let's say, would
you not agree that that would force you to be more creative than if you had the
entire rainbow to work with?  That sort of limitation often stimulates new ideas
and perspectives that they would never have had in an infinite environment.  

   If you were working in a completely arbitrary-pitch environment, would you
not still build music on patterns, and probably repeated ones (over time and
pitch)?  

   Now bear in mind that a tuning system need not necessarily mean a fixed set
of pitches.  That in the sense that, for example, full-blown JI or meantone is a
system of an indefinite number of pitches.  

   Living within a walled room lets you can hang pictures on the walls!
