Subject: ready made orc&sco...where?

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.ne.jp>

Hi!
Now I'm learning Csound.
I usually use SoundEdit to produce exact Hzs of sine-wave that I want.
Since I can't find a way from what I should stick into about 
csound...I'd rather choose a way to seek the ready made orc&scos...
At this stage I just want to know how to write microtuned tune with many 
voices.
The more simple the instrument is the better for me right now but the 
song itself should be complicated so that I can guess how to control the 
length and velocities.
At first I'd like to just edit the Hz data and enjoy the variations.
Can somebody give me a sample...or tell me where I can find this sort of 
just my type kind of examples?
Thanx

PS.

I like looping  several mov-files using QT-movie-player.
If we can share the Key-Hz and create orc&sco things .... exchanging 
open-platform-co-minimal-sound-fragments might be more small-file 
oriented?
Somebody doing this already?
