Subject: Microstock 4

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

I can't believe we're on our 4th concert, but I am very grateful. This 
year, our special guest is Mayumi, playing her original compositions for 
microtonal synth; Haverstick will be playing Music From Other Worlds, 
space music for electronic 19 and 34 tone guitars; and a local gamelan 
ensemble, Tunas Mekar, completes the bill. The concert is September 19th, 
at Cameron Church, 1600 S. Pearl, in Denver...any questions, post me, or 
call 303-477-3268. Also, if anyone from out of town wants to come, let me 
know, and we'll try to dig up some place to stay...hope some of you can 
make it...Hstick
