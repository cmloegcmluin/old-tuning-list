Subject: 12 et only

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
	The current practice of teaching only 12 tet music in schools, 
colleges and universities is akin to teaching only the mathematics of 
whole numbers and claiming to be teaching mathematics. I could teach a 
mathematics course like this and justify it by claiming "Well, the only 
mathematics the general public likes and understands is recreational 
number theory. All the great theorems of mathematics are number 
theoretic, and we don't have time to teach analysis, algebraic topology 
or complex variable theory anyway."
	But I would be wrong.
John Starrett
