Subject: Cents without Logs

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

Most cheap hand calculators have only the four functions, 
+, -, *, and /, though a few have a square root (SQR) key as well. 
I've often wondered what the point of having this last key is as I would 
expect that  most people sufficiently sophisticated mathematically to 
need a SQR key would probably need a log key too. After all, how often 
do most people have to calculate geometric means, Std Dev's., diagonals 
of rectanges, radii of circular areas, or RMS values? And if they did 
these operations often, wouldn't they occasionally want other functions 
like the sin, cos, tan, log, exp, etc. as well? 
	Anyway, I began to think how one might compute cents without a 
log key and looked up Ellis's algorithm for integer cents in Helmholtz's 
"On the Sensations of Tone " in appendix XX, section C. This algorithm is 
really very simple: reduce the ratio to a single octave (remembering how 
many octaves there were), reduce it to again if necessary so that it is 
less than a 4/3 or 3/2 by multiplying by 3/4 or 2/3. Now take the 
difference betweeen the Numerator and Denominator of the reduced ratio 
and divide it by the sum of the N and D. Multiply this quantity times 
the "Bimodulus" 3477 and add 1200 cents for each octave by which the ratio 
was reduced and  498 or 702 if the octave reduced ratio was larger than a Fourth or Fifth. The final result should be accurate to a cent (there is 
an minor 1 cent correction for reduced ratios between 450 and 498 cents). 
In practice, it is simple and fast as the reductions may be largely done 
by inspection.
	Why does it work and why 3477?  Well, there is an old and well-
known approximation to the natural log of (x+e)/(x-e), 2e/x, where e is 
a small number. Let the reduced ratio be N/D (N>D), let x = N+D (the Sum 
of N and D) and let e = N-D (the difference) and substitute into both
expressions. Then (x+e)/ (x-e) becomes (N+D+N-D) or 2N over (N+D-N+D) or 
2D and Ln (2N/2D) = ln(N/D).  This ln is approximated by 2*(N-D)/(N+D).
	The cents value of N/E is defined as ln(N/D)*1200/ln(2) or
approximately 2*(N-D)/(N+D) *1200/Ln(2). The factor 1200/ln(2) is 
1731.234+ and twice it would be 3462.5. Hence one would think that 
formula for the approximate integer cents of small intervals would be (N-D)/(N+D)*3462. Ellis discovered empirically that 3477 works better, 
giving nearly exact results for 5/4 and only slightly deviating ones for 
larger and smaller intervals. 3462 is less convenient as it requires 
small corrections. Reversing the procedure yields a close approximation to 
the decimal form of the ratio if one is given an interval in cents.
	While this technique is not a fundamental breakthrough, it is 
an interesting reminder of just how clever the 19th century scholars 
and scientists really  were. The upshot is that if, alas, one is ever 
stuck with only a four function calculator, one can still do tuning 
theory.
