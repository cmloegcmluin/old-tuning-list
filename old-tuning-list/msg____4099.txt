Ok, Brian, why would the upper note decrease in pitch that much more than 
the lower note? Must be because God so loves neutral thirds. And presumably, 
for minor sixths, the lower note would decrease in pitch much more than the 
upper note. So what would happen to an inverted augmented triad? Can God 
create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? I think I'll go on counting 
the angels on the head of a pin, thank you very much.
