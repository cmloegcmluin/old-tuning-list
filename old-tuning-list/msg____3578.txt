Subject: Four remarks on Smith 's topic

From: Franck Jedrzejewski <franck@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr>

Four remarks on the Ronald Bruce Smith 's topic :

1. The book of Allen Forte had have an important influence in France
impulsed by the IRCAM people. It has completely masked the works
of a French musicologue Edmond Costere who had published a
theory very closed to pitch set theory. 
E. Costere : Lois et styles des harmonies musicales, Paris, Paris, 1954.
E. Costere : Mort ou transfiguration de l'harmonie, Paris, PUF, 1962.

2. Ronald Bruce Smith said that Magnus Lindberg is the only IRCAM
composer that had a knowledge of Forte's theory. Many others composers
(Tristan Murail, Hugues Dufourt, Jean-Yves Bosseur etc....)
perfectly know the Forte's theory, but they don't used in their 
own compositions. Magnus has said (I can't remember where but I have read it)
that he used the pitch set theory in his compositions. Perhaps the book
had been introduce in France by IRCAM. I remember, I had bought it in
the St-Paul-Meanneapolis Fine Arts Museum Book store and have not
seen it before in France.

3. The "objet sonore" is a concept of Pierre Schaeffer and electro-acoustic
music, born in the GRM (Groupe de Recherches Musicales), not really a "friend"
of the IRCAM because they have to deal with the same pie... Messiaen, Dutilleux
and Boulez don't refer to the "objet sonore".

4. If IRCAM had opened "les nouveaux espaces", "a rather large and impressive 
extension to their building in Beaubourg" said Smith, IRCAM has also always been
in crisis. Many people think that IRCAM has imposed his esthetics in the french
developpement of the music, had marginalized many other musical institutions
and eat to much money for what they do. Pierre Boulez had published an interview in 
"Telerama" (a TV program paper) last week on the musical french life.
In reading this paper, you could understand what kind of people is Pierre Boulez 
and understand how IRCAM had been what it is today.
