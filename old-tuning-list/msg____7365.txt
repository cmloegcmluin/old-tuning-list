Subject: Linus Liu Intonation awarded top rating

From: Linus Liu <linusliu@HK.Super.NET>

For a change, a very popular rock piece "California Hotel" got full ten
points after I put in the correct pitch of the vocal parts with the Pitchwheel

command.

The original, otherwise identical midi file, had a rating of seven. Now both
files
are there on Midi Farm web site.

"Linus Liu Intonation" explains how music are composed so it may be played in
tune; how and why music becomes attractive, and how and what to compose
in music.

QUOTE

Sorry for the slow response and thanks for the song!  It has been added to
our search engine (search.midifarm.com) and should be added to our general
directory after midnight tonite.

The songs sounds outstanding!  (I gave it a ten out of ten in our ratings)

Thanks again,

Curt
