Well just happen to have it in my home directory...

Here is the code I use to generate multiples for ET scales, e.g.,
a.out 31 to generate multiples for 31 tone scale.  Then I put in
a gen 2 (I think) statement for Csound and do table lookup in instrument.

Really is pretty simple.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

main(int argc, char **argv){
int i,n; 
float x;
n = atoi(argv[1]);
/*printf("%d\n",n);*/
for (i = 0; i < n+1; i++) {
	x = pow (2.0, (float)i/n);
	printf("%f ",x);
}
printf ("\n");
}
