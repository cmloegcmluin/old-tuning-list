Daniel,

The notion of psychoacousitc "stability" that I eluded to is clearly only a 
part of what constitutes "stability" in a musical context. I'd be happy to 
use a different word if you could suggest a better one -- "rootedness?" 
Nevertheless, it has some explanatory power, as I have shown.

The masking will of course be far worse in the subharmonic case, where the 
combination tones will tend to fill up all of frequency space, while in the 
harmonic case, the combination tones will be restricted to integer multiples 
of the fundamental. For root-position triads in the same register, the 
combination tones will be spaced 2.5 times more widely for major than for 
minor; as the harmonic limit increases past 5, this number grows very 
rapidly. If I misunderstood you here, could you give a concrete example of 
what you were talking about?

What if you're dealing with string lengths instead of frequencies? Certainly 
string lengths are a more "intuitive" quantity than unobservably fast 
frequencies! (This is intended to be a reductio ad absurdum).

Actually, looking at string lengths would lead you to believe that 
subharmonic relationships are even simpler that harmonic ones. An a priori 
numerological analysis will not favor harmonics or subharmonics in any way, 
despite your claim that there are differences. It is only by looking at the 
psychophysical phenomena that the inequivalency manifests itself.

Please explain this in as technical terms as you like. I have a degree in 
physics.

Taking your stamements at face value, why does this "mathematical boundary 
problem" affect frequencies and not string lengths, oscillatory periods, or 
wavelengths? If you were correct, then these three quantities would be 
happier producing subharmonic series (in which these quantities march 
unimpeded up to infinity) than harmonic series (in which they plummet down 
to the depths of the infinitesimal). Again, note that I am being facetious 
and my intent is to demonstrate the absurdity of your arguments.
