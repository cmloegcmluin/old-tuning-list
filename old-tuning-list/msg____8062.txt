Excellent. Thanks.

Also, I'm basically in agreement with all your responses to my 
comments on the wishlist.  Of course, as you'lI understand, I treat
the list as a place to spark ideas rather a place to define what goes
out to anyone off-list.

Yes.  At the same time its worth saying (here) what you really *do*
want - in case someone here thinks of a way of simplifying it and
making it more likely to happen.

Pass.  Is Bill (Sethares) on the list these days? any feelings on
this?  Neither is something I use at all, currently, but the option 
would be hugely advantageous, and I'm sure I would were it 
convenient.  Two major problems are (a) defining the logic (b) 
making that logic configurable. One thought: personally, I think I 
would be more or less content if this could be implemented as a 
convenient 'post-production' technique.  But people who are 
interested in using these machines for live performance would 
presumably want more than this?

Personally, I'm perfectly happy with cents only.  The idea of having a
unit that tunes in terms of ratios is, I think, rather interesting.

Yes indeed: my example was meant to be just a suggestion to bounce
around.

As an ex database programmer I guess I thought the interface I 
described very simple.  Maybe not for a synth/sampler?  But yes, I
agree.

That might be acheieved by aiming a wish-list at a particular 
forthcoming model from a particular manufacturer - choosing one 
option only (from your three) and saying what you think is both 
realistic and as near to ideal as will not be considered crazy for
that particular model.  I guess the thing may be carved in stone by
the time one hears of new models (?) but it seems worth a try.  No?   

I have drafted a letters to Roland/Akai but not happy with it yet.  
By the way, how would you feel if I referred to your wishlist URL 
in it?
