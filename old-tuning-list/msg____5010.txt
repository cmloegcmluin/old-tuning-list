Subject: Paul's experiment, MicroFest West

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I was finallyable to run Paul Erlich's experiment using JiCalc and
old Mac internal sound and I must say the differences between the 400 
cent and  the 372 cent third in a triad with a 720 cent fifth are 
dramatic. In fact, the 0 372 720 cent triad sounded initially almost 
like jump to a minor triad if it came immediately after the 0 400 
720 one. 

The 5/4 third sounds pretty poor with the sharp fifth, however.

The 395 cent third I derived sounds about quite a bit like the 400 
cent one, but a 408 cent Pythagorean third (with 720 cents) is 
noticeably harsher.

The 0 348 720 cent minor triad sounds rather neutral to me.

Of all the triads I tried, I liked the 395 and 400 cent thirds
the best with the 720 cent fifth. Needless to say the 1/1 5/4 3/2 
was the most consonant.

As for your more complex psychoacoustic model, what meantone-like
tuning(s) does it generate? The resulting equations, with and without
the Major Sixth/minor third term, are messier than I have time to
deal with tonight even with an equation solving program.

As for "expressive unisons," they can be very poignant. I believe
Wyschnegradsky made considerable use of them.



To change the subject, those of us in the LA area should not forget 
MicroFest West Saturday night at Pierce College. I'm planning on 
coming up from San Diego to meet Erv Wilson, Marcus Hobbs, Stephen 
James Taylor, Bill Alves etc. In addition to Neil Haverstick and Rod 
Poole, John Schneider told me Kraig Grady will perform. The LA TImes 
reviewer wrote in last Sunday's paper that some of Lou Harrison's music 
will be played. 

Don't miss this one...
