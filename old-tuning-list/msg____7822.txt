Subject: Electronic Musican article on tuning

From: Xou Oxno <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

In the new Electronic Musican - June '98 - there's 
an article on the Buzz Feiten tuning. Includes a
section on the history of tuning.

Gosh. This article idea sounds so familiar. Where did I hear 
about an article like this in the past few weeks?  ;)
