   I think that that's an appropriate observation.  Harmonic fusion can
make melody lines harder to hear, and slight detuning can make notes easier
to pick out from the crowd.

   That is another example of one of Ivor Darreg's favorite points, that
melody and harmony are often at odds with each other.  What sounds smooth
and even melodically (e.g., an equal temperament) often sounds rough
harmonically.  And the reverse:  What sounds smooth and even harmonically,
(e.g., two different sizes of whole-step) can often sound rough
melodically.
