 I am looking for a theremin player! <brazen snip>
Anyone you can recommend in the LA/San Diego area that can read and play?

   I bet Robert Moog, at Big Briar can tell you who is playing where.  He has
been traveling all over the country  with his theremins.  ( I got one,  it is
the ultimate "air" machine). 
   And for the possible "thereminists-to-be-maybe-if-I-find-one-more-reason-
to-get-one" out there,  when it comes time for the amp, I strongly recommend
that you get one with not only reverb, but also chorus effect.   The really
clean, dry, theremin sound is strong, but extremely difficult to do without a
lot of woodsheddin'.  It is surprising how fast things get rusty when your
chops are waving.    
    The instrument really comes alive with some phase activity going on.  I
suppose this effect may share some psycho-affective territory within which
tempering operates.  Speaking of tempering...........
    The historical temperament crusade added another head (University piano
department) to the converted.  After a weekend of Young, Beethoven, and
Steinway, Dr. Reed, at Lipscomb University, called me late Sunday, saying he
was a changed man!   This was his first exposure to Well Tempering, and two
days later, he played his Sabbatical recital( a biggie),  on a temperament he
didn't know existed a week before.   
      Someone tell McClaren that another pebble has fallen off the "ET
monolith".
