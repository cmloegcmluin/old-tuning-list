John, the type of CD your talking about is called a "mixed mode" CD or
"CD-ROM/XA". Putting graphic files, text and even MPEG-1 video is easily
done. Any current CD authoring software and burner should be able to
accomplish this task. The big deal about the XA format is that it writes
the data track after the audio tracks, otherwise you would put the CD in
an audio CD player and the first track would be computer noise that can
damage audio equipment..

I mastered CD's for 10 years at a large duplication house. Though I don't
master CD's anymore, I still work for a duplication house and could get
your CD's done for cost, or at least I will try, I have been discussing
this with Neil off the tuning list.

Also, keep in mind that a 74 min. CD can hold approx. 650 megs of data.
It is my personal experience that a CD that is filled to the outer rim
can have some playback problems on some drives.
