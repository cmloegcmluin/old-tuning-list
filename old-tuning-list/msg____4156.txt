Subject: i lurk

From: "Marcus Hobbs" <marcus@fa.disney.com>

hello,

i'm a tuning list lurker.  i am a computer animator at disney feature animation
by day (and night), and a musician by night (and morning).  i have a bachelors
in math, for all it's worth, and professionally code software as part of my job
duties.  too much, in fact.  i am now fighting carpal tunnel syndrome, hence
the non-capped typing.  i am tired of 12TET.  sick to death of it.  my first
knowlege of alternate tunings was gained here on this list, found by way of the
just intonation network web page.  since then, i have been composing soundtrack
type music, techno/dance music, and algorithmic composition using an ensoniq mr
rack, and a kyma, in 19TET, and recently, 31 TET.  haven't made it to just
tunings just yet.  my greatest desire is to hear other microtonal music, but
alas, i know not where to find it (certainly not at tower records, i think).  i
just met stephen james taylor at a kyma user group meeting, and for the first
time, heard his wonderful stuff.  he knows many other microtonal compsers, so
i'm hoping from here to continue to be exposed to new tunings.

i really enjoy this list.  i'm on many, and believe me, this is by far the most
polite, professional, and substantial list.  yeah, i'm a mclaren fan too.

i wish there were an easy way to hear others' music on a daily basis.  you'd
think that we would have figured out a way to make that happen by now.

with the advent of the kyma (tuning resolution: less than 0.0026 hz!  or is it
0.026 hz?  i forget), it's possible to think in terms of the entire
audio spectrum as a canvas of sound, although midi persists to be the limiting
factor in controlling it, and all things audio.  as the kyma continues to
develop, i hope to eventually not think in terms of "tuning", but in terms of
painting sound images.  sigh, someday.

marcus
