Subject: Guitar intonation fixers :Novax fanned frets

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Don't know if you've discussed this before seeing that it's kind of old 
news.

While Buz Feiten's system is the latest in bettering the guitar's 
intonation,there is (at least I hope there still is) another older and 
much more blatant and obvious system.
A luthier,Ralph Novak, invented a system with a fanned  fret layout where 
the spacing between frets is wider on the lower (6th) string side and  
narrower on the higher (1st) string side.

Guitar Player reported that it did indeed work very well (though they did 
not mention any real technical details ) .The jazz guitarist Charlie 
Hunter plays (still ?) a seven string Novax guitar built by Novak.Novax 
(the company name) also offered replacement necks.I've always wanted 
one.....

Cheers,
Drew
