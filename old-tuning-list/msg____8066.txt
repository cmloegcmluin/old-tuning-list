Subject: Kyma price, Yamaha retuning

From: wauchope@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil

> Who Knows how much Kyma costs?

I talked to Symbolic Sound a month ago and the base system price with
two DSP cards is $4400, expansion cards (up to 6 additional) are $595
each.

Individual notes of a programmable tuning table can be retuned on the
fly via SYSEX, but that will affect all voices using that table, not
just one channel.  (Also notes currently sounding aren't affected, just
new ones.)

The sample playback side of the Yamaha does include a bunch of
synthetic waveforms, but Gary was more interested in the FM synthesis
side, which uses oscillators (sine wave and variants) as raw material
for cooking up much more complex sounds.
