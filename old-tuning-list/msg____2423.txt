I have the names from an Italian book:
Pietro Righini: Lessico di acustica e tecnica musicale, terminologia
e commento musicologico. Edizioni G. Zanibon, Padova 1987.
My Italian is not so good, but I think it says there was a substantial
amount of influence by other cultures in Thailand, mainly Indian
and Chinese. So it may not be unlikely that the scales were imported
from Malaysia or Indonesia and adapted to the Thai 7-tET scale.
