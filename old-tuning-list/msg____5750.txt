He most certainly did use the relative in-out-of-tuneness in his music,
and he was not alone!  In ANY of the frequently used well-tempered
systems, F major is the most in-tune key with C and G close seconds.  The
less used keys are much more out-of-tune, yet, as required by the
well-tempered philosophy, usable.

For a revealing exercise, look at cadences on F# major.  They nearly
always occur at some point where their very weakness has structural import
to the piece.  For example:

Prelude and Fugue in D, BWV532
The opening section is all in D major - fast scales - very light and
showy.
The second section of the prelude is somewhat whimsical and uses dotted
rhythms over a pedal F#.  It is usually played on a secondary manual (even
on equal-tempered performances) with a lighter registration.  This section
cadences on F# major.  Note that, because F# major is prettymuch on the
out-ofne side of the spectrum, the F# major chord is short - only an
eighth note long, and followed by a grand pause.  The section basically
'falls apart' on such a weak cadence.
The grand pause is followed by a two octave scale leading up to a HUGE
(usually full organ) chord on D Major - an incredibly bright key.  This is
followed by one of the most glorious Alla Breves in music - full of joy
and light.  Further analysis would show how very carefully Bach related
the keys of sections to the tension necessary.
 
You could also look at the Toccata and Fugue in F - the one that begins
with a long canon between the hands overa sustained pedal note.  In the
Fugue, there are a number of deceptive cadences that bear analysis.  They
all proceed from very tame dominant chords (Ex. C Major) to outlandish,
very much more out-of-tune chords (such as Db third inversion).  This
makes the deception even more shocking.  

Bach used that same technique in many other pieces.  I remember two young
daughters (under age 10) listening to a performance of the G major "Piece
d'Orgue" which also has a glorious All Breve section which concludes with
a shocking deceptive cadence to o vii o7 of V.  Even though they had been
listening complacently, they both gasped audibly (to the performer's
delight and amusement)

Look at the Prelude in C major from Book One of WTC.  Listen to the chords
in any standard well-tempered system, and you will hear a rise in tension
over a long arc, then a release, than a larger rise which gives way to
final release.  (It was this piece that made a believer out of me.)

Bach was not alone in his use of the relative dissonance/consonance of
chords.  In the Burkhart anthology, look at the Scarlatti Sonata in E
Major.  It, too, has an internal cadence on F# major which is marked as a
short note followed by a grand pause.  he then proceeds to fanfares on
open fifths on F# (where we discover that it was the A# third that was
causing the out-of-tune F# triads - the fifths are VERY in-tune.)
