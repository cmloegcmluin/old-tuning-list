Subject: Re: Johnston's notation defended (again)

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Please understand this as a salve to understanding.  1200 points on a 
line representing an octave is a continuum.  Would 1300 or 2000 points 
make a discernable difference?  I think 1200 is just past the threshold 
of pitch accuity for human beings.

In essence this is the digital equivalent to CDs and DATs.  So much pitch 
information is available as to appear infinite.  Nice proportion, I think.

Ben Johnson once wrote a piece for me for bassoon and tuba.  We spent so 
much time deciphering the notation into cents that valuable rehearsal 
time was lost.  The piece was performed beautifully in tune, but perhaps 
at a third too slow, or more.

I do not speak of "conflicts" in the notation, but "conflicting 
directions" of mathematical calculations.  For a player to have to think 
up and then down, and maybe up again puts the music in a laboratory 
setting for analysis.  Finding fingerings take time, rewriting the part 
takes time, and playing with new fingerings takes time, over and above a 
conventional 12ET piece.  In AFMM concerts we do it all the time.  The 
above story is a special case.

If players can't feel the new intervals there is something much more 
seriously wrong than the notation used.  Gardner Read has fully 
catalogued the plethora of pitch alterations in use.  (20th Century 
Microtonal Notation, Greenwood Press 1990.)

To Gary M.,

What if I asked you to paint with only certain colors in any one 
particular painted work.  Isn't knowledgeable choice the ultimate path of 
music making.  Isn't a system a control placed upon one's perspective, 
one's final fronteir, one's potential.  Lou Harrison once told me that 
when he taught at Mills which was all-female he would never use the words 
"tuning system" in the title of a class: no one would show up.  And yet, 
by all means compose using material that you are comfortable with, 
whether it be 88ET or Extended Just Intonation.  

Notation that is less a personalized mythology of meanings of 
relationships, and more a comparative of all that is available will 
further the cause of microtonal music significantly.
