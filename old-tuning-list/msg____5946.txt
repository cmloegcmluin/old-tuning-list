It seems nobody has picked up on this, so I'll offer
some comments.  Most of this is pretty involved, so you have
my permission to skip to the end of this post.

The Fourier series is a way of turning a periodic signal into a
sum of sinusoidal waves of integer frequency multiples.  I've
never heard of this stated as a theorem, but it is.

This would be true for autonomous systems -- that is, where the
state of the system depends entirely upon its previous state,
and not explicitly on time.  The wave equation is a 2-D
autonomous equation -- it depends upon amplitude and its
derivative with respect to time.  An autonomous system with 2
continuous variables can have a stable periodic motion, but
cannot have prolonged aperiodic motion.  With 3 variables, chaos
can arise, and a system with 1 degree of freedom can have a 3
dimensional equation of motion.  I can explain more of this
off-list.

I'm not at all sure what this means.  To clarify, though:

A one dimensional continous autonomous system cannot have
periodic behaviour: that would mean moving in different
directions from the same state.

A perfect, infinitely thin string with perfectly clamped
endpoints _can_ have non-integer overtones.  This will always
be the case where the speed of sound in the string depends
upon its frequency.

I'm sure two coupled oscillators can produce chaotic motion.


As regards this FAQ, can we have some kind of historical and
geographical coverage of standard tuning practice?  When was
meantone / well / equal temperament in use  is a question that
seems to come up fairly frequently.
