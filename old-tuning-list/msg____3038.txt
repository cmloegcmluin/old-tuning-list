I sat in on a music theory class on Friday, they were going through
Messiaen's Quatour pour la Fin du Temps.  When they got to discussing his
choice of mode and the melodic motif of descending tritone, the teacher
explained that the interval of singing the eleventh harmonic, then the
eigth (11:8) results in a resolution, as opposed to the traditional
tonic-augmentedfourth-fifth.  He sang these intervals to demonstrate.  He
even built the mode by tritones by singing.  I might have raised the point
that the intervals he is singing don't happen on the piano.  This teacher
is, too, almost doing something right.  But he retreats.
