Subject: TUNING digest 1434: Just Harpsichord

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Fallen Leaf Press (2419 Oregon St., Berkeley, CA 94705) publishes Douglas=

Leedy's _Harpsichord Book 1_ in just intonation, including a very
interesting UTREMIFASOLA and striking melodic use of the syntonic comma. =


The harpsichord is perfectly suitable for just intonation work. A good
instrument is a delight to tune by ear through eliminating beats. In
planning how your tuning is mapped to the keyboard, try to assign pitches=

that are the same as or lower than the instrument is usually tuned in ord=
er
to avoid breaking wires. If you need to tune higher than usual, it may be=

wise to use a lighter gauge.  =
