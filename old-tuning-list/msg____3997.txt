Subject: The hideous truth about web searches
for info on the word "microtonality" - post 2 of 2

(COMMENT: Predictably, a small vocal minority
will contradict with a great deal of misinformation
every statement made in the last post. Here,
as cold hard proof that no useful info is 
yet available to the microtonal beginner on the 
WWW, is an actual transcript of a typical web
search session:)

(COMMENT: Again, this has nothing to do with microtonality,
and we've seen it before.)

(COMMENT: And b-dat b-dat b-dat b-dat's all, folks!
What an incredible list of non sequitur junk info, eh?
Out of ALL of these references, only 4 had anything
to do with microtonality: [1] Manuel's and my list of
microtonal music on CD, [2] The EMF catalog containing
a couple of microtonal CDs, [3] the Elliott Sharp website,
[4] Elaine Walker's ZIA website.
*Notice that the most useful starting point on microtonality
anywhere on the web--the microtonal bibliography at mills--
was NOT found.*
Good work!
So the search engine turned up VAST amounts of irrelevant
*crap,* but COULDN'T FIND the single most useful source
of info on microtonality on the web. 
Hey...that sounds about right.
Web pages on algorithmic composition and industrial music...
a bibliography of books on synthesizers...a "special 
exhibition of science stuff" at a museum...
You know, as long as the Lycos search engine was 
finding irrelevant trivia in its search for "microtonality"
on the web and *ignoring* the single most useful
source of info *about* microtonality on the web, 
why not just go all the way?
I mean, why do things by halves?
Why didn't LYCOS just spit up a list of URLs at random?
The Sudan Web Site...Sex life of frogs web page...
the Chrysler web page...these non sequitur websites
have exactly as much to do with microtonality as
the actual sites puked up by the LYCOS search engine.
Worst of all, this is TYPICAL of the results
for ALL search engines.
Naturally a few of you will vociferously claim
that all these statements are untrue, etc., etc.
Alas, there seem to be a handful of forum
subscribers dedicated to purveying misinformation
and canards whenever and wherever possible. The
brutal fact is that the only way to weed out all
the junk info and bad hits containing websites
irrelevant to microtonality is to refine your
search for the word "microtonality" in such
a sophisticated way that you'd have to already
know what you're looking for.  In short, all the
search engines on the web generate useful info
on microtonality *ONLY* if the searcher *already
knows* exactly what s/he's looking for.  
But this is *never* going to be the case for
a microtonal beginner.  Thus, newcomers to
microtonality are left high and dry--left to
wander for themselves in a blizzard of junkthink,
guitar ads, industrial music reviews and 
web pages touting MIDI software which has
*nothing* whatsoever to do with microtonality.
Ladies and gentlemen, you'd have better luck
examining tea leaves in your quest for useful
information about microtonality than in searching
the world wide web.
