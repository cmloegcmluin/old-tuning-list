It is my understanding that General MIDI starts at C-1 being labeled MIDI Note number 0, extending to G9
being labeled MIDI Note number 127 (Note: the 88-key range of a piano keyboard, by these criteria,
extends from A0{an octave and a sixth above C-1} to C8, with C4 corresponding to Middle C). MIDI Note
numbers may be extended higher than 127, but I have not encountered examples of them being extended on
the low end. Any observations from more experienced readers?
