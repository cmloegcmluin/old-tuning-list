Maybe your music criticism could be more constructive?

This would be hard to detect in your previous posts.

and then you write:

I wasn't guessing.

That's David to you, Neil.

Sounds like flame bait to me! I'm not going to search the
archives and pull Neil's previous posts to support my claims.
That would be a waste of bandwidth and my time. Or
maybe I should whip up a web page with Neil's rambling
rantings and contradictions.

I should point out that I was VERY disapointed with his
CD when I bought it at AFMM a few years ago. Not that
I didn't give it a chance: once a year I pull it out to see if I
like it yet. No luck so far.

Whatever.....I'll have some of my music on line (in the form
of Real Audio) in the weeks to come....gotta get rid of AOL
and find a new ISP first.
