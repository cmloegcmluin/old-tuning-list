A brief cautionary note concerning Ben Johnston's notation:

I feel I must reluctantly take issue with this appraisal of John Fonville's 
Perspectives article; while Fonville deserves praise and encouragement in 
his efforts to bring Ben Johnston's music before a wider (academic) public, 
I have been disturbed by some misunderstandings which threaten to confuse 
anyone new to Johnston's (and indeed Partch's) theorising. I can't recall 
everything that worried me, and I don't have the article to hand at this 
moment, but I do clearly remember the most important matter, which is as 
follows: Fonville employs the terms "otonal" and "utonal" in a manner which 
contradicts their original usage in Partch -- a usage which Johnston has 
preserved. In Partch, strictly speaking, only a sequence of intervals can 
have the property of otonality or utonality; in Fonville, on the contrary, 
a single interval considered in isolation will have these properties. For 
Fonville, "otonal" means that the highest prime appears in the numerator, 
and "utonal" that the highest prime appears in the denominator. Fonville 
was at liberty to devise new terms for the purpose, but he chose, rather 
perversely, not to do so; this new and conflicting usage threatens to 
undermine the important and much more elusive distinction that Partch and 
Johnston draw by means of these two terms.

As for the supposed limited usefulness of Johnston's notation, I would 
again tentatively beg to differ, since I have myself been generalising this 
notation for the purpose of representing meantone temperaments, and for 
analysing Renaissance polyphony in JI terms. Readers may see for themselves 
whether they approve of the results at:

http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/issues/mto.96.2.6/mto.96.2.6.walker.html

and in recent exchanges on mto-talk, the e-mail list accompanying mto 
(Music Theory Online).

If my comments on Fonville are not clear enough for some readers, I'd be 
prepared to expand a little. The same volume of Perspectives (1991) 
contains Steven Elster's analysis of Johnston's String Quartet No.6, and of 
course he explains "otonality" and "utonality" in a clear and orthodox 
fashion (he could hardly have analysed this quartet otherwise!).
