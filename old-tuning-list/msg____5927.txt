Subject: Just Intonation dictionary entry

From: kollos@cavehill.dnet.co.uk (Jonathan Walker)

I invite anyone who might be interested in the contents of the new Just
Intonation entry in the next edition of Grove to mention what they think
ought to be included (since I've just been commissioned to write it).
I'm thinking of bibliographical information more than the substance of
the article, but feel welcome to offer suggestions on the latter. While
the larger part of the article will deal with theory and music from the
late 14th to the late 16th centuries, I intend to include a fairly brief
final section on modern developments in extended just intonation. The
proposed word-count for the entire article is 1500 (to be agreed), but I
might ask for another 500; still, this is brief, so I can't mention
everything I'd like to (Partch, Tenney and Johnston will receive a
mention).

The deadline for the completed article is 15 November this year. I'm
making this request only so that no-one need complain afterwards that
I've left out something they think is of great importance. I can also
send an advance copy (whenever it's ready -- probably September) to
anyone who would like to make further suggestions.

Perhaps more important than this, I'd ask those of you who regularly use
Grove to take a look at any articles of relevance to the concerns of
this list: if you think any of them urgently need revising or replacing
please offer your suggestions. Grove is the first resort for so many
people, both within and outside academia, and for tuning topics, they
may well never look further. If you want to recommend yourself, or
someone else as author/reviser of an entry, I could make initial
enquiries by telephone with one of the editors (which is cheaper for me
than for those of you in the States). Remember that 15 November 1997 is
the general deadline, so it's not worth embarking on this process if you
don't think completion of anything authoratative is possible at such
short notice.

This message is purely a list matter -- I don't represent Grove, nor did
they suggest any of this. If you want to contact them directly about
revising or writing an entry, you needn't mention this message, because
they won't know anything about it.
