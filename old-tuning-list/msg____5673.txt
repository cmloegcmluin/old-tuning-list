There will be no counterexamples because Paul's guess is correct.  In
general, it is only possible to construct such chords for composite
limits (such as, in the snipped example, 9).  7 being prime, it is not
possible.  I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this
bandwidth is unfortunately too narrow to contain . . .

(Actually, it's not particularly marvelous; I just haven't figured out
how to translate it from my muttering and making henscratches to myself
to something a sentient being would understand.  If anyone wishes to
challenge me on it, though, I'll give it a go.)
