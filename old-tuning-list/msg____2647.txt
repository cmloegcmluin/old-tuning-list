Thanks to all who gave suggestions to my 7:4 related delusion. Especially to
 Kami for your formula. Quite difficult for a guy like me but will try hard to
 get the image. Thanks also to Manuel for MAX info. I'm wondering why that sof
tware doesn't have a function that let the user directly get the Hz he wants. 
I hear that the program has a lot to do with IRCAM....then why? To buy MAC-MAX
 system to start some kind of self-composing-alternative-tuning-music or not..
..that is a problem for me right now.

   Ammm...one more selfish question. I'm using QUADERNO33 and it only has 4MB 
MEMand a strange dsp for PCM recording. Playing .wav is the only way to make t
his machine act musically. Any suggestion to make this TOY play a alternative-
tuning things......well, mission impossible....maybe souldn't have asked. Actu
ally I downloaded SCALA and......you know how it resulted...ha ha(half crying)

    A little bit away from this list's theme but .....how come could you get i
nformed of Japanese Quiz program? Are those things popular? Talking about the 
TARZAN thing Johnny had mentioned. Microtonal?
