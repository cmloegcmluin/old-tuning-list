   I'm glad to hear you're using 88CET!  :-)

   No, seriously now, what matters most to me is just that we explore great
new musical possibilities in whatever new tuning.

   But I did want to ask something kinda embarrassing:  I can't for the
life of me seem to remember what "AWE64" refers to!  It seems like I used
to know that, but I can't place it.  Is that a PC sound card perhaps?
(Maybe I'm just zarked after a long day!)
