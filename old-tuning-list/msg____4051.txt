   Notice that I said that a diatonic half-step very small compared to the whole
step struck me as sounding "strange", not "ugly".  Presumably it's a case of
sociological conditioning.  

   One of Ivor Darreg's observations about 17TET is that it reverses one of the
usual premises of harmony.  In particular, the major third is such a dreadful
dissonance that it must be resolved outward to fourths.  That then makes it a
good candidate for quartal and quintal harmony (Ivor didn't say that
specifically though).  So it's not necessarily a case of putting any kind of
harmony behind a 17TET melody sounding "YUCK!", but triadic harmony in
particular.

   Is that the topic of your up-coming Xenharmonikon paper?  It sounds
interesting, since that's one of two ways that come to mind immediately as the
basis for the construction of the traditional major scale.  The other of course
is tetrachord.  Since there are big dissimilarities between the scales
constructed by those means, and since the scale itself came about before triadic
harmony, I can imagine that there is fertile ground for a paper there.
