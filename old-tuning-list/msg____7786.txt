I'm not swithcing examples. You said you could hear the 3-ness of 81/64.
I'm just asking you, if you sweep through interval sizes, where the
3-ness drops in and out.

>Lastly, I wonder if you'd care try this example using odd limits.

Sure. All intervals in that range have an odd limit 19 or above. 19 is
generally too high for me. Therefore, I don't hear anything.
