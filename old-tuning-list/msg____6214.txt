Subject: E-mu Morpheus microtonal suitability

From: "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca>

Everyone,
I used to have an E-mu Proteus/1.  When re-tuning, the samples of the note
numbers are used rather that the samples that would work with the pitch
setting.  31TET sounded very bad because high end and low end samples would
be used inappropriately.  At the web page of the Electronic Music Foundation
they ( http://www.emf.org/index.html ) are offering a Morpheus for $629 if
you join their organization ($100).  This is less than half the retail
price!  The Morpheus is a descendant of the Proteus line and as such accepts
the same SysEx messages.  Does anyone know if the corrected the problem of
sample shifting has been corrected?  Can anyone point me to an expert who
would know?  Thanks in advance.
---Fred
