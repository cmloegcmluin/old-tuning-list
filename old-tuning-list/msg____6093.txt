I will jump in here to stand up for a couple of people who *do* write
microtonal pop music, especially Jon Catler and Neil Haverstick.  Neil
contributes to this list often, and plays blues/rock on guitar and bass in
a myriad of tunings.  Jon plays all sorts of music, from experiemntal
improv to more rock and blues-based tunes.  Denny Genovese's band plays
poppy stuff with a world-music orientation, although it might sometimes
cross over the "art" world.

Anyway, I find that most folk music with open guitar or banjo tunings in in
pretty good intonation, often with an inventive quality as far as tuning is
concerned.

There's nothing wrong with "experimental high level" music, though.  It
usually seems that someone willing to get involved with the microtonal
theory is usually bent towards the experimental aesthetic.
