Subject: Teaching and classifying tunings

From: Jose Antonio Martin-Salin <101610.3043@compuserve.com>

First of all I would like to apologize for starting a discussion
abouth "teaching tunings" a few weeks ago and not responding, since I got
disconected from the internet for a few weeks with my removal.

	I would also like to say thank you to Neil, Johnny and Paul for
responding to the subject which I consider very important.

	I finally got to understand limits, utonality and otonality in
1/2 an hour of explanation from Brian Lee, who I would also like to thank.
I had "Genesis of a New Music" at home  for two years and I never got to 
totally understand it. Is anybody on the list using U-tonality (equal 
space fretting) for composition. I would be interested on hear something
more about it.

	Johnny said:
"Also, a list of listening materials that 
correspond to each and every lesson might be adviseable.
Most important is the real time singing of intervals, perhaps a new 
interval each and every lesson"

	I'm finding through Carnatic music that the only way to 
distinguish the difference of the pitches (and ornamentation around 
the tone) on the similar ragas, is to actually sing a traditional catchy 
tune. Putting everything into numnbers made it really confussing. 
So I agree with your point and would also like to ask you what vocal 
(or choral) material can be use for beginners for the different groups 
of tunings already classified by Paul through his 15 week tuning course 
proposal:

>1. Introduce the octave as an acoustical phenomenon
>2. Introduce the 3-limit consonances and Pythagorean tunings
>3. Pythagorean tunings as applied to pentatonic scales: Chinese Music
>4. 7-ET representations of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom: 
>Thai music
>5. Pythagorean tunings as applied to the heptatonic scale: Organum
>6. Discuss the pythagorean comma; introduce 12-ET representations of the 
>heptatonic scale
>7. Non-just non-equal-tempered scales: African and much other music
>9. Schismatic tuning of late middle ages and medieval Arabic tuning as 
>Pythagorean approximations to the 5-limit
>10. Just intonation: Indian music (I've heard some santoor music where the 
>intonation is very clearly just 5-limit).
>11. Discuss the syntonic comma; introduce meantone temperament: Renaissance 
>music
>12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone -- 31, 19, is 12 good enough?
>13. Circulating temperaments/well temperament: Bach and "key colors"
>14. 12-TET becomes standard :( , Arabic music measured and played in 
>"quarter-tones"
>15. Equal tempered versions of just intonation: 53, 34, maybe compare 
>22-equal with 22 sruti of Indian music to show how JI structures are 
>preserved
>16. Atonality, set theory, Balzano and 20-TET and other numerological 
>constructs.
>17. Introduce the 7-limit consonances
>18. Augmented sixth chords as meantone approximations to the 7-limit
>19. Introduce the 9- and 11-limit consonances in JI: Partch, Johnston, etc.
>20. Equal-tempered representations of higher consonances: Huygens, Fokker, 
>and 31; Herf, Sims and 72, proposals of 41-tone and 171-tone equal 
>temperaments
>21. Inharmonic timbres, tunings to go with them: Gamelan music, modern 
>explorations
>22. Non-octave scales in history and modern non-octave tunings such as 
>Pierce's 13 per 3:1
>23-30. Creative ensemble projects
 
This is also for anybody else who could suggest any other vocal works connected
to
any tuning different than the 12 Tet !!!!!

	I have translated into english the index of a book which is used 
by the Spanish Conservatoir as reference for the subject of acoustics :
"Afinacion y temperamento en la musica Occidental". This is also a good
classification of tunings (Only western I'm afraid):
