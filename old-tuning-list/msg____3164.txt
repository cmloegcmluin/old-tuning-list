There are several pieces by Ben Johnston that you might like.  His music is
sparsely recorded but a good music library should have some old LP's, and
there's a more recent (1993?) CD from the "Music Amici" called "Ponder
Nothing: Chamber Music of Ben Johnston".

I'm not sure which of these are available...

"Sonnets of Desolation" (chorus)
"Mass" (chorus, trombones, percussion)
"Ci-Git Satie" (chorus, bass, drums)
"Three Chinese Lyrics" (soprano & 2 vlns)

There's also Harry Partch's music - maybe you would like "Delusion of the Fury"
