Subject: MAKING AN YELLO NOIZE

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <CXL03253@niftyserve.or.jp>

I asked GARY to inform me of his 88CET-system. After reading the things he s
ent to me....I began to feel like asking more about it. But, instead of sendin
g an extra duty to him....If it could be a suitable subject over here...I want
 to try sending maybe FAQ kind of Question to this m-list. My question goes as
 follows...
  
  So the 88CET music would be a multi-tonal system? If I'm not making mistake,
 it sounds like as if each half-tones becoming 88cents. If so...can it be said
 that each note can become a root just by the choice of it's attendants? Ah! T
hat was what the 100cents for each half-tone was trying to make possible...but
 couldn't really do. 88CET can make it more natural, right?
  I came up to this kind of idea...what about it? If the 7:4 means a lot to ma
ke the hole things sound natural in it's vicnity, can't it also become a struc
tural backbone for the scale the music use for it's melody? What happens if we
 picked up the NEXT note just by choosing the one that has 7:4 frequency...I m
ean instead of choosing the fifth. Can we meet the fifth somewhere? I'm really
 just asking because I don't have the answer. Why I'm making this kind of irre
sponsible noise is because that I thought t
he whole thing sounds something similar to the fractal-graphics....outlook str
ucture having a similarity to the inner structure....if that could be the othe
r aspect of 88CET...to me...I seems more interesting than the natural harmony 
it actually can make....
  Well, JUST A NOIZE from my strange dream.
