Most likely.  Six people contributed to original spec.  A preliminary
version was published in Computer Music Journal with a request for
comments.  One comment was received.

But the spec says that the full keyboard "non-real-time" dump isn't
intended for performance.  Instead, there's an additional 12-byte
"real-time" message for retuning any individual note on the fly.

I don't know exactly what Justonic is doing, but I can't imagine why it
would need more than these 12 bytes per note-on.  The synthesizer
doesn't need to know the entire tuning table, it just needs to get
up-to-date frequency data for sounding notes from its host.

To quote from the spec:

"There is some question as to whether instantaneous response to
real-time tuning changes is desirable in every circumstance. In some
performance situations it makes more sense if a tuning change affect
only those notes which occur subsequent to the change, and not affect
sounding notes. But there are also situations in which tuning changes
should take place instantaneously, as specified in the standard, and
should affect sounding notes without disrupting their continuity.

"If the instrument responds well in the latter situation, some
workaround is possible for the former. The reverse is not true.
Therefore the standard requires that tuning changes immediately affect
sounding notes. Manufacturers might, however, consider implementing a
switchable instantaneous/next-note-on option within an instrument."

I still think this is sound.  An example of when immediate response by
sounding notes might be desired: glissando of a tone to keep a fixed
tonic during certain modulations.
