It turned to crap a long time ago.The Indian film industry has nothing to 
do with art.It may be statistically the biggest,but has been making the 
same movie for 50 years or so.

Even the recent 'innovations' in Indian pop music were concocted by 
'Indians' from other countries,mostly Britain,some Austrailian,and a 
former San Francisco cabbie  .

The prevailing socio-cultural-educational atmosphere has no room for 
*art* or anything  innovative.
And,the British have nothing to do with any of it.It's all home grown.
