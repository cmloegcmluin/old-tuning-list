   From my work with 88CET tuning, I have found that nonoctave tunings are
interesting (partly) BECAUSE OF the universal perception of octave-equivalence,
rather than IN SPITE OF it.  Warren Burt, Paul Fly, and others immediately
latched on to this as well, when they played with 88CET.  (Let me put in another
quick plug for Paul Fly's 88CET "sketches";  they're really neat stuff.)

   Paul E indirectly mentioned in his post why octave-equivalence makes
nonoctave tunings valuable:  In an octave-based tuning, each octave's span
provides octave-equivalents of the same basic harmonies, whereas in a nonoctave
tuning, each octave's span gives you an all new set of harmonies.  

   So the almost universal perception and agreement on the idea of octave
equivalence bodes well for nonoctave tunings, because it ensures that they
provide more harmonic variety than octave-based tunings (for a given scale-step
size).  

   Then again, if you don't buy the idea of octave equivalence, and feel that,
for example, a 5:2 M10 sounds fundamentally different from a 5:4 M3, then you'd
conclude that octave-based tunings as well nonoctave tunings provide all new
harmonies in each octave's span.
