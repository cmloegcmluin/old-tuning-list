Unequal tunings waste the melodic substance no less surely than equal
temperaments whose tuning degrees are either much narrower or much wider
than 60 cents or so. A 19-tone unequal tuning would result in
appreciably more intervallic confusion, given the fact that the 19-tone
equal tuning degree is close to the limen. Modulation would also be made
more difficult, and certain  consonances would be too deteriorated for
use.

Thanks very much for your correction regarding the method of finding
numbers of 12-tone versus 19-tone modes. You are quite right that the
tonic must be omitted from the calculation. The corrected numbers would
be nCr (n=11, r=6) = 462 and nCr (n=18, r=6) = 18564 (not 12376, you
must have used n=17), or a factor of about 40 to 1. Since I am concerned
here with modes, not keys, the transpositions I neglect.

I have enumerated all the possible diatonic and chromatic modes in
12-tone equal and 19-tone equal, using tree diagrams. I can assure you
that many chromatic modes distinct in 19-tone equal are merged into a
much smaller number of such modes in the 12-tone equal. The exact number
of these modes depends on what criteria one uses, e.g. numbers and
character of consonances, number of consonant chords, inclusion of
septimals, etc. I will post these modes in due course - meaning when I
have a solid day or two free for the purpose.
