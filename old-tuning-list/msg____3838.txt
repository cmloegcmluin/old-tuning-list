Yes - my choice of the word 'bother' my have sounded dismissive of live
performers. I apologise. Be assured that it was not my intention to
denigrate anyone's musical practice. 

It happens that for one reason or another, playing live can fail,
temporarily or otherwise, to be an option. Then the resort to non-realtime
at least has the compensation of being potentially without the encumbrance
of notation. I suspect that quite a few readers of this list may be in
that position - which would explain why not many could respond when asked
what method of notation they used. 

The appeal of software can be compelling for all sorts of reasons. But
perhaps this is not the place to discuss the socialogical aspects of live-
versus canned music. Or is it?
