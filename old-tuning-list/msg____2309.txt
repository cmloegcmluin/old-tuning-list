Subject: Re: Just Tuning - definition

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Well John, it's pretty hopeless to ask a couple hundred tuning-heads to avoid
editorializing when somebody as authoritative as the Harvard guys say something
as ... "distasteful" I suppose ... as that!  

   Yeah, I've heard that Harvard definition of JI before ("any tuning that
incorporates five or more acoustically pure types of intervals within the
octave").  I personally doubt if it's refering to what it sounds like it's
refering, and it's certainly vague whatever it's refering to.  

   First of all, it never defined "acoustically pure".  "Equal to an untempered
small whole number frequency ratio" would be a reasonable guess, but of course
then they'd have to define "small".  

   Second, it doesn't define "types" of intervals.  Are the fifths from scale
steps 1-5 and 2-6 (regardless of their tuning) different "type"s, or is this
sort of typing independent of position in the scale?  If it's independent of
position in the scale, is the fifth from 7-11(4) - a diminished fifth - of the
same "type" as the other fifths?  Are all perfect consonances one type, major
another, and minor another?  

   Third, it doesn't clarify whether "within an octave" includes an octave or
not.  That sounds nit-picky I know, but if you've got four other than the
octave, you've got to know the answer.  

   Here's how I suspect that definition came about:  They got the number five
from the number of exact 3:2 perfect fifths in the circle forming the historical
Ptolemaic tuning.  In that tuning, the fifths between scale-degrees 4-8(1), 1-5,
5-9(2), 6-10(3), and 3-7 are exact 3:2 fifths.  7-11(4) is not perfect, and 2-6
is where the circle breaks by inserting a comma-flat fifth.  At that point, I
suspect they took that number 5 and, without thoroughly understanding the
question, wrapped what turned out to be deeply ambiguous words around it.  I'm
speculating here of course.  

   But let me make one very important point:  I suspect that it's difficult to
support the idea that the definition of just intonation has been invariant over
the centuries, and over the various schools of Western music.  JI enthusiasts,
and most others knowledgible of tuning ideas, take it to mean - essentially -
the opposite of temperament.  But one can probably argue fairly successfully
that the definition was far more narrow in earlier times.  I doubt if Ptolemy's
followers would have viewed Monophony as just intonation.  Considering that
(according to Dave Hill) Rameau rejected 7:4 as a basic harmonic building block,
I suspect that they probably would have viewed Monophony instead as more like
cacophony!  Fortunately for Partch fans like me, the realm of musical
possibilities is far more experimental nowadays.  

   (I'm sorry John;  I accidentally deleted your message before I got a chance
to answer - to you directly - the two specific questions you asked.  If you'd
like me to answer them specifically, please resend them to me personally.)
