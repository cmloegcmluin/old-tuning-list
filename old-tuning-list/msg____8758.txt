From: Neil Haverstick <stick@uswest.net>

be shipped...they said they would go out tomorrow or Thursday, and
should arrive next week. I hope everyone gets their discs with no
problem...the # for One Off is 303-770-6600 if anyone has
questions...still need to hear from Sethares and Genovese...see
you...Hstick
