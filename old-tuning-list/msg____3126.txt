the MR rack lists for more like $1600 and it's in a rack, not a keyboard
unfortunately.  Try looking for a used EPS-16, they tend to go for
$7500-$1000. In fact if you're interested I know someone who's selling one.
They don't support MTS but are supported by JICalc for downloading tunings.
Likewise some inexpensive keyboards have scaling of keyboard-pitch
modulation- you can change this to get N equal tones per octave. 

That Kawai probably does support temperaments- these assume an
octave-repeating tuning with a +-50 cents variation per note.  Most
'tunable' samplers, even expensive ones, use this system.  Ensoniq's
EPS/ASR, VFX/TS, KT and MR let you tune any key to any other MIDI note with
an offset.

In terms of MTS the MR series is the only game in town.  We're shipping the
keyboard with sequencer version and it should be in stores soon if anyone
want to check it out.
