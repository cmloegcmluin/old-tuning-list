I know nothing about Indian music and so may quite wrong.

However, I think that saying that each note is "a bit of an area" rather
than a fixed pitch may be a little misleading.  Rather, I think it is a
set of locations in an area.  They are very definite and not just
random.  My source for this information is an excellent little book,
"An Introduction to the Study of Indian Music" by E Clements (1912).
There is a diagram at http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif
which shows the relationships between the notes in indian music with the
ratios of 2, 3, 5 and 7 shown.  The frequencies and names are according
to Clements and the layout according to an idea I got from elsewhere.

Some notes like ma have 7 different frequencies (although 2 are old
values), namely 315, 337, 320, 341+1/3, 324, (333+1/3, 316+4/81)
and are the flat7, natural, flat\, t and flat respectively.

I acknowledge that practitioners do know what to do.  However I suspect
that you automatically go to the correct one of the above depending on
the context.
