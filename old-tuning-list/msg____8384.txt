Subject: Fripp

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

In the January 1986 issue of Guitar Player mag, there is an in depth 
interview with Fripp, and he is asked point blank if he uses other 
tunings (such as 31); the answer was no, but he did seem quite 
intelligent on the subject of tunings, etc. I've always thought Fripp and 
company were likely candidates for other systems...maybe someday...Hstick
