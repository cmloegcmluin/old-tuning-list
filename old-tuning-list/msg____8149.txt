In reference to you posting to Tuning Digest #1450:

>With tuning to exact 7/4s, intervals between adjacent notes will be 8/7,
except for one that is 44 cents sharper.  Tempering would be to make it
more like 5-equal.  Analysing one of the .au files, this seems to be the
case.  I make the scale this:

                        1  8  64     7  2
                        -  -  --  x  -  -
                        1  7  49     4  1

>(They should look like fractions if you're in monospaced mode.)

>The note x is tempered midway between the two adjacent notes.  So, those
intervals are 22 cents sharp of 8/7.  I measured this accurately enough
that it can't be 5-equal.

According to "Chance and Choice: a compendium of ancient and modern wisdom
revealing the meaning and significance of the Myth of Science" by Arnold
Keyserling and Ralph Losey, [1993] 1994, ISBN 1-883185-52-1, page 76:

The Primatonic Scale (9 octaves x 5 notes = 45 audible notes) can be
represented by the following chart:

: A      E       I       O       U       A
: |------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
: |      |       |       |       |       |
:1.0    1.14    1.31    1.49    1.75    2.0

Which by my calulations relate to the ratios: E (8/7), I (21/16), O (73/49? or
perhaps [pure speculation <g>] 7 * Log of [7 to the base 2] reduced by "1"
octave, i.e. to 1.49345) and U (7/4). All of which convert to, in cents,
respectively: E (231.174), I (470.781), O (694.379), and U (968.826).

And on page 77 says "Note that the vowel scale designation is arbitrary, was
made before the discoveries of Tomatis, and does not correspond with Tomatis
vowel/chakra alignments."

There is now a book on "PrimaSounds.: The Discovery of Chakra Music" by Arnold
Keyserling and Ralph Losey available at
<http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSoundsBook.html>. It appears to contain
material in part from their CD booklets and their book "Choice and Chance".

This scale (page 75) "opens hearing to the inner Universe and in most ancient
civilations this music was held sacred. the music is fractal, based on zero,
the fourth dimension and the Strange attractor. It has no melodies, rhythms or
other forms or order found in other music. It sounds almost completely chaotic,
unpredictable, yet there is a fractal link to your own being which makes the
sounds soothing and leaves you serene. Being attuned to the primal energies of
the soul it has the power to throw you into the zero dimension, to open you to
the healing influences of the Strange attractor."

The book fully discusses the subjects of Music in pages 69-74 and PrimaSounds
in pages 75-86.

In "Laws of Wisdom: An Introduction to the Natural Laws of Human Potential" by
Ralph Losey, Esq, essentially the other book is quoted as a small extract
concerning PrimaSounds.

Three CDs (which I also have) are available (via the website) which well
demonstrate the use a PrimaSounds:

"Life Tuning with Prima Sounds: The Discovery of Chakra Music" by Arnold
Keyserling and Ralph Losey (1993)

"Primasounds" by Ralph Losey (1994)

"Gate Keeper with PrimaSounds" by Ralph Losey and the School of Wisdom (1998)
