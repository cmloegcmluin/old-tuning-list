Subject: RE: Help!; theories (FAQ)

Pat,
There are actually two versions each of TD 1131-1133 (at least). I will
e-mail you all you need if you still need them by the time you read
this.

>I suppose if a really good definitive FAQ were compiled, 95% of the

I completely disagree. People tend to be too lazy to wade through vast
quantities of information to find what they're looking for, so they ask
the list specific questions. However, I am 100% in favor of creating a
Tuning FAQ, and volunteer to co-create it. I will only have this e-mail
account for two more months, so I can't make a long-term commitment.
Many of the TD's are on the Web (when will more be added to this
archive?) so some sort of FAQ might be culled from there.

If anyone wants to suggest a starting point for creating the FAQ, let me
know. Otherwise, maybe I'll come into the office late one night and try
to put something together.
