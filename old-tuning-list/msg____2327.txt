Subject: definition of JI - response summary

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

Re the Harvard Dictionary of Music definition quoted on 
EARLYM-L: Just Tuning is "any tuning that incorporates five or 
more acoustically pure types of intervals within the octave." 
I got the responses I expected from this list - very polite 
but very clear! Assuming that "acoustically pure" means 
"intervals that can be represented by rational numbers" 
(otherwise I'm sure the responses would be even more tart!):
<
If HDM's definition of JI flies, then so does Reagan's assertion 
that ketchup is a vegetable.

I wouldn't consider a scale with 5 pure types of intervals and 3 
or so impure types to be just intonation.

I haven't heard anyone before consider something a just tuning 
with ANY number of ratios that are irrational relative to all 
other pitches in the system.

I find that a little silly.

Just Intonation is any tuning in which ALL of the intervals can 
be expressed as integer ratios, with a strongly implied 
preference for the smallest numbers that are compatible with a 
given aesthetic purpose. (Partch)

It's pretty hopeless to ask a couple hundred tuning-heads to 
avoid editorializing when somebody as authoritative as the 
Harvard guys say something as ... "distasteful" I suppose ... 
as that!

A few responses noted that if the emphasis in the HDM definition 
was on the "more", it was barely acceptable. It was also noted 
that the meaning of JI has changed with time - it had to have 
meant something different when keyboards were limited to 13 or 
14 notes per octave (D# , and sometimes Ab, split).

Thank you for your responses. Now, does anyone have an email 
address of the HDM publisher?!
