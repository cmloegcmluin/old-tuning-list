Subject: microsingers (very small singers?)

From: Adam Silverman <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

I'm interested in finding out who some good microtonal singers are; could
someone please send along the names of anybody you know who has good 
experience in this area?  I already know Toby Twining and his group, plus 
there's Stephen Kalm and Dora Ohrenstein.  Anyone else?  I'm basically 
thinking about soloists.

Come to think of it, I'd be interested to find out about what kind of 
microtonal vocal music is out there; there is a conspicuous absence of 
songs on the JI Network tapes, and perhaps one or two on the PITCH 
cassette, if I remember correctly.
