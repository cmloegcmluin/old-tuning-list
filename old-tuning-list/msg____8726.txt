Obviously Neil doesn't know that the famous psychic Murphy has
predicted that everything east of the San Andreas Fault is about
to fall into the Atlantic.

Perhaps we should think about narrowing the focus to the western
oriented folks for this conference.  Not that I want to exclude those in 
parts East, but there does seem to be more expressed interest in doing 
something in San Diego. Dever is definitely nice in the summer,
though there is not much skiing going on.

Joe Monzo, are you and your friends there ready and willing to set
something up?  Or are we better off working toward L.A. area?

I would offer to try to set something up here in the Sonoran Desert,
but summer temps get up to 122 lately.  That's why Phoenix has
such great summer rates.
