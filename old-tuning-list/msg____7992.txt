HI John:

Very much enjoyed the comments on octave/keyboard.
I forget there are composers who like to modulate.

Both your comments are an enhancement.  You also seem 
to know a lot about synths.  Tell, me: how does one
find how many (and over what time period) of a certain
synth were made?  Like - the Yam TG33 : nice unit, but
I've never seen one other that the one we put in up at 
SUNY.

Cheers, 
Rick S.
