Subject: MIDI file convertor

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

A program I wrote several months ago is now available from
Charles Lucy's site at ilhawaii.net/~lucy.  It makes various
alterations to MIDI files that may be useful to those working
with alternative tunings.  It's written for DOS, but I've
included the C++ source code, and it should compile for any
platform.

The features are:

Retuning a file using pitch bends.  This is an afterthought,
and probably not as slick as Scala, but it doesn't touch the
file type which someone wanted recently.

Taking a piece in a non octave scale, and splitting it into a
number of different octave scales on different channels.  This
is something Brian McLaren specifically asked for, and seems
to be useful for some sample based synths.

Converting a piece in an equal temperament into a number of
smaller ETs on different tracks.

More general channel/note mappings.
