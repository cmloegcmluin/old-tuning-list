Thank you; I accept your apology.

Gee--maybe it was someone else pretending to be him? :-)

Well, I have to admit I'm impressed by the amount of time and effort
you've spent on the subject.  Nevertheless, I assert that a subjective
impression based on vast experience is still a subjective impression.
Surely, drawing upon all that knowledge, you can point to some piece of
objective evidence that would convince a skeptic?

If I may remind anyone who may still be reading this seemingly
interminable thread, this all came up because Mr. Frosztega asserted
that Kirnberger failed to rebut Marpurg's assertions because he knew
Marpurg was right.  Whether Kirnberger or Tempelhof wrote the essay in
question, while an interesting question, is not particularly germane;
the fact is, Kirnberger took vigorous action to defend his position.

(BTW, I'm an atheist.  I don't plan to wait around for an afterlife I
don't believe in to ask Kirnberger to resolve the issue. :-)

I'm probably going to have to concede this one, because my German,
sadly, is much worse that Mr. Frosztega's English, and I don't know when
I'd be able to spend the time to work through that much of it.

Perhaps, but it seems no greater a stretch than some that Rasch makes in
his article.

If it has nothing to do with temperament, then it really isn't going to
help with the question at hand, is it?

Okay, let me see where we stand here:

 1.  You admit you accidentally misrepresented the evidence Rasch
     offered in his article.

 2.  You admit Marpurg made an error (however uncharacteristic) in the
     passage Rasch quotes.

 3.  You assert that your great familiarity with the relevant literature
     qualifies you to speculate about the matter in question, but you
     have so far presented no concrete evidence to back up that
     speculation.

 4.  You then go off on several tangents, which as far as I can see
     (with one possible exception) have very little to do with what
     temperament Bach used.

Well, gosh, I'm convinced!  Can't understand why I didn't see it
before--of COURSE Bach used equal temperament!

(Sarcasm aside, really, Mr. Frosztega: if the evidence is really that
overwhelming, can't you present us with some of it?  What little you've
given us so far I find unimpressively weak.  Bach surely had input on
the construction of some organs; if any surviving ones are in ET and are
known to have been that way since Bach's time, that would be a good
sign.  Tuning instructions reliably attributed to him would also do.)
