I agree that its a cool program and does the 
pitch bend thing about as well as possible.
There are problems with porting it, however.

First, it is written in BASIC (please don't laugh)
which means it ought to be fairly easy, but

(a) it need to be compiled - on the ST the interpreted
version is not fast enough to use real time, while the
compiled version is (just barely) fast enough. I suspect the
Mac will be similar.

(b) the BASIC needs to have some kind of MIDI 
input/output commands.

I haven't looked extensively, but I don't know of any
BASIC's with both these features.

Alternatively, if someone is enterprising, I would be happy
to supply the source code for translation into some other
language.

Finally, if anyone with an ST wants a copy of Microtun,
let me know. It's distributed as "songware".
You can have a copy for free, but agree to send me copies
of any interesing things you record with it.
