Thanks.  I spend a lot of time on my postings.

I'm being delayed by two factors -- car legalities
and work on my book (which I *really* want to
have done before I go).  I expect to leave by the
end of this week.

The rough itinerary is Albuquerque, San Diego,
LA, San Francisco, (Seattle?,) Denver, Albuquerque,
Philadelphia.

I'd like to meet face to face with as many of you
western microtonalists as possible.  If you're
interested, email me your phone #.  The whole trip
will take roughly a month.
