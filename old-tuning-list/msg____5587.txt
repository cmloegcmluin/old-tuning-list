Subject: 22-tone guitar (Paul E)

My 22-tone 7-string guitar is finally up and running. For now, I have settled 
on a tuning of 9-9-8-9-9-9 (these are the intervals between the strings, low 
to high). This allows me to play the 7-limit tetrads as barre chords in root 
position with the root on the 5th or 6th string (I consider the utonal chord 
to be in root position when it sounds like a minor sixth chord). After about 
a week, my fingers have adjusted to the narrower spaces between the frets, 
and I'm getting pretty quick at knowing which size "whole step" or "minor 
third" to play at a particular time. I must say that Indian-type melodies 
work a lot better than Western ones in diatonic scales with two 
different-sized whole steps, and as long as the Indian influences are 
creeping in I'm gravitating toward modes like 4-2-5-2-2-5-2, which, as 
2-1-3-1-1-3-1 in 12-equal, I pretty much avoided until now . . .
