Subject: Brian descends from Sinai. Film at 11 (other stuff, too)....

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

It would appear that my hopes for a bit of newfound
self-reflection (you know, the sort that might occur
to the rest of us when we arrive late to an ad-hoc
technological construct already in progress) on Brian's
part are dashed again.

Did the regular mantra "you people" remind anyone else
of H. Ross Perot seated at a table with a bunch of charts
and tables? :-).

So - who will volunteer to let Brian know that there isn't
a Design Police we can call and that *we* didn't write the
search engines? And while we're at it, perhaps we could get
the boy to telecommute to our day jobs so that we've got time
to implement his directives. I'm getting the impression that
this sprawly PoMo stuff annoys him because it doesn't offer
a sufficiently robust vehicle for replacing the orthodoxies
he fulminates against with orthodoxies of his own (that
old seductive Rortian "Final Vocabulary"). Plus ca change....

On a less tiresome note, this past weekend found me down in
Chicago for the second "Table of the Elements" festival. It was,
in ways I might not have predicted, a real monument to some
particularly visceral examples of Plomp and Levelt and the
Japanese brothers K in action; we got two doses of Tony Conrad
(once with Gastr del Sol, once in a trio [2 violins, 1 'cello]),
some high amplitude studies in "roughness" and consonance at
very low frequencies from Bernard Guenther, and Keiji Heino's
high amplitude timbral engine along with Fushitsusha. I did my
stealth recruitment thing by patiently trying to explain to the
folks sitting with me what it was they were hearing. I tried as
hard as I could to stick to layman's language, and it seemed to
work pretty well - they bought me drinks for several evenings.

Returning home, we actually *did* broadcast LaMonte Young's
"The Well-Tuned Piano" all the way through from 9:00-2:00 AM.
One youthful caller rang up to whine for "something that doesn't
suck" [Hardfloor, I think he meant], but the rest of the calls
were overwhelmingly curious and positive conversations of the
"I thought at first that this was outta tune, but what are those
little high noises I keep hearing?" or "How does he get the sound
of the piano to 'slide' like that?"

This is an indirect reminder that I'm still soliciting work from
any of you who're interested in being included in the playlist of
the upcoming all-non12TET RTQE special. LaMonte was the plow
that broke the soil. Join your pals messrs. Polansky and Sethares
Scholz and Haverstick. If you're interested, drop me a line.

With regards,
Gregory

paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
