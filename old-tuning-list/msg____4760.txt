G'Night John Boy-
	Neil Haverstick stated that the harmonic series is a natural 
phenomenon, and that deviation from it is deviation from the "pure" 
in some way. I disagree, and I agree. In nature, there are no physical 
objects that vibrate with a pure harmonic series of partials above the 
fundamental. The harmonic series is a construct of our mathematical 
minds, modeling a phenomenon first observed with our nonlinear hearing 
mechanism, and later with lab instruments. The harmonic series is an 
idea, just as is the beatlessness of simultaneously sounding simple 
tones.
	Making a scale from a pitch set of harmonic partials divided down 
into the octave is no more natural than making a scale from a pitch set 
whose elements are related by small number ratios. They are both 
constructs of the mind, and in my view perfectly natural things (we are 
not in the world, we are the world). 	
	We may have, hardwired into the structure of our brains, an innate 
musical understanding of the harmonic series, but we may be hardwired 
for understanding small number ratios as well. For that matter, we may 
be hardwired for mathematical understanding of all that we can understand 
mathematically, and that may spill over into musical understanding, even 
of tempered and non-octave scales. 
	In short, I don't think we are in any position to say what is 
natural to our musical understanding and what is not. Further 
psychoacoustic research may shed some light on what musical 
structures are more primal, but I haven't seen anything convincing 
yet. I'll bet Brian Mclaren has an opinion on this.
