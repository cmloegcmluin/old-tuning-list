I personally think that you're on the right track, Matt.



> Paul's comments seem to be focused on an idea of mode rather than mood.

   The devil (that is "I") made him do it!  No, just kidding.  His concern there
stemmed from my distractingly oversimplified example of a composition consisting
of mostly neutral triads.  My point was that although no one triad lasted long
enough to be clearly discerned as neutral, the overall ambiguous sensation of
neutral thirds came through loud and clear.  

   But Matthew's right that moods are a cumulative effect not specific to any
one mode.
