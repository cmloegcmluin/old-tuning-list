I see what Paul means here, but I misinterpreted him to the extent 
that I thought he himself subscribed to the view that Aristoxenus 
implicitly described 12TET. However my misinterpretation ends there, 
and there was much more to my reply. I'll explain why I'm not 
satisfied with the above:

First, as Dan Wolf was quick to point out, the Greeks, from Pythagoras 
onwards certainly did not despise/ignore/try to remain in ignorance of 
irrational numbers. Prior to Pythagoras's theorem, they did indeed 
hold to a theory of proportion which required, for example, that the 
three sides of a right-angled triangle must always be rationally 
related. Pythagoras showed that this was not a necessary truth, by 
proving that the square root of 2 was irrational; since, for example, 
if take each of the other two sides of an isoceles right-angled 
triangle to be one unit in length, then by the theorem, then 2^(1/2) 
is the length of the hypoteneuse, the proof that the latter bore no 
rational relation to the other sides demolished the older Greek theory 
of proportions. Here is the proof traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras 
(I'll flesh it out considerably):

If 2^(1/2) is rational then we can express it in the form a/b, where a 
and b are relatively prime integers (i.e. they have no common 
denominator higher than 1). Every ratio of two integers can be reduced 
to this canonical lowest form, so if 2^(1/2) is rational, it must also 
be expressible in such a form. Thus since a/b 2^(1/2)

                         a (2^(1/2) * b

Squaring each side, we obtain

                          a^2 2(b^2)

If 2^(1/2) is indeed rational, then this equation must be soluble for 
relatively prime integers a and b.

Now from the equation we see that since a^2 equals a multiple of 2, 
a^2 must be even, and therefore a is itself even, i.e. there is a c 
such that a 2c. Hence

                      4(c^2) 2(b^2).

Dividing both sides by two we obtain

                      2(c^2) b^2

But then b is also even, and so a and b are both divisible by 2. But 
this is a contradiction, since a and b are relatively prime, and thus 
have no common divisor higher than 1. Since there are no solutions to 
the equation a^2 2(b^2) for any relatively prime integers a and b, 
2^(1/2) cannot be expressed as such a ratio, a/b, and therefore 
2^(1/2) is an irrational number.

This, of course, was only the beginning of the Greek exploration of 
irrational numbers, and Dan has listed the most important instances of 
later Greek mathematicians employing them. But it certainly marked the 
end of the older Greek theory of proportions. Now if this proof of the 
irrationality was provided by Pythagoras, or even if it originated 
from among his followers, its provenance is considerably earlier than 
Aristoxenus, and centuries earlier than Ptolemy.

It would seem, therefore that Paul cannot credibly call upon any 
supposed Greek repugnance for irrational numbers in order to explain 
why Greek mathematicians failed to interpret Aristoxenus in terms of 
an equal division of the octave. If any such repugnance had existed, 
it had been swept away before Aristoxenus, and ironically, by the very 
Pythagorean school to which Paul would ascribe much of the blame.

Secondly, even given that the Greeks, post-Pythagoras, were perfectly 
well able to conduct their mathematics in areas requiring irrational 
numbers (I trust Paul is by now convinced of this), I would still 
contend, contra Paul, that 2^(1/12) is not the irrational number that 
would have suggested itself in any Greek attempt to revise 
Aristoxenus. As I said yesterday, Aristoxenus's tunings are presented 
as divisions specifically of the tetrachord, and not of the octave. If 
Greek mathematicians or music theorists had wished to find an 
equal-tempered re-interpretation of Aristoxenus, they would surely 
have attempted to work out a division of the fourth, and not of the 
octave. It was only because of the special status that Ptolemy 
accorded the 2/1, five centuries after Aristoxenus, and his 
characteristic presentation of Aristoxenus's divisions in the form of 
an octave spanning the diezeugmenon and meson tetrachords, that we, 
and Renaissance theorists before us, have forgotten the earlier 
emphasis (in addition, of course, to our own notions of the primacy of 
the octave). What any Greek revision of Aristoxenus would require then 
is something like the model Cleonides derived (uncontroversially) from 
Aristoxenus, of a fourth divided into 30 parts; our Greek 
mathematician would then have to extract the 30th root of 4/3, which 
would mean (for them) the cubic root of the fifth root of 2, divided 
by the fifth root of the cubic root of the square root of 3, and then 
try to measure this out for a monochord. Not a very attractive 
proposition, especially when you have no method for extracting a fifth 
root!
