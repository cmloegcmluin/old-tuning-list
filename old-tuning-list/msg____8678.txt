Subject: Re: Indian tuning on my website

From: monz@juno.com

Hey folks, hope you found that ramble about
Indian tuning interesting.  I got inspired
and stayed up way past the Standard Time
changeover to put it up on my website:

http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/indian.htm

It includes a few interesting links on the subject,
particularly the Batish Institute's "Sitar Lesson
#5".
