His EP "Alien Love Secrets" from 1995 is free of effects -- just
distortion and some samples of his baby son "talking". Have you heard
it? I haven't heard the follow-up, "Fire Garden".

To get back on the subject of this list, Vai did a piece with microtonal
clusters, which is included on the CD "Flex-able". I believe he just
overdubbed the same part 8 times, transposed one degree higher (in
96-tone equal temperament) each time.
