From: Brent_LeVasseur/InTouch_Center@itc.tais.com

Remember, Li and Yorke's "Period Three Implies Chaos".....

Call me ignorant, but I have no idea what you guys are talking about.   But
I would like to learn.  Any suggestions on a good information source?

I would also like to thank who ever keeps bringing Steve Vai into the
discussion on micro tonal guitar tunings.  He has really been an influence
on my playing
and he has done some pretty innovative work with the guitar.

Thanks
