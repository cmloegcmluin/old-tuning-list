Subject: forum CD liner notes

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Hey forum CD folks...I am ready to type the liner notes, but can't 
seem to find any info from Sethares or Loffink...there are 2 
possibilities: 1. I blew it, and can't find them,or 2: you guys didn't 
send them...I think I kept everything pretty well together, so perhaps I 
never got any...could you let me know? I am indeed ready to put this 
together...if you do need to send notes, alas, I cannot download...please 
send them to Starrett at  jstarret@math.cu.denver.edu  or, maybe you 
could send them to me on computer disc...looking forward to the home 
stretch...Hstick
