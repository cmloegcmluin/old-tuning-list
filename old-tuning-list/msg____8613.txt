This book is a reprint with the language updated from the 1940's.  The title
was something to do with 'Scales'.  Sorry I can't remember the earlier
title.  Anyhow the book deals with Danielou's ideas on what 'affect' various
intervals (ratios) have on consciousness.  He deals with similar things in
his book "North Indian Ragas" in the earlier chapters and gives a list of
each ratio (3 and 5 limit ratios) and the 'affect' he believes it gives.

The same charts can be found in the web page to do with the 'Semantic'.
