Subject: Part 2 of McLaren's Biblio Post

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Paul Rapoport's grossly deficient bibliographies,
 part 2 of 2
--
The last post exposed in detail the deceptive nature
of Paul Rapoport's inadequate bibliographies.  Bear
in mind that Paul is no exception here--YOU are also
to blame.  Virtually *all* microtonal music theory
articles suffer from outrageously incomplete bibliographies,
and the net result is that when doctoral students try to
write theses about microtonality, they wind up parrotting
out-of-date sources like Yasser's "Theory of Evolving
Tonality."
This is a MAJOR problem for the progress of microtonality,
people.
Wake up!
If the information on the characteristics of various tunings
IS NOT AVAILABLE, then *every microtonalist will have to
re-invent the wheel.*
That's *insane.*
It's crazy!
It's as though, if you wanted to compose in 12, the only
references available were Tinctoris and Boethius and
Aristoxenos.  
--
Here, once again, is Paul Rapoport's bibliography from the
article "The  Structural Relationships of Fifths and Thirds 
in Equal Temperaments," Journal of Music Theory, 1994, 
pp. 351- 389:
"Blackwood, Easley. 1982. Twelve MIcrotonal Etudes for
Electronic Music Media, op. 28 [sore] New York: G. Schirmer."
"---- 1985. The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic 
Tunings. Princeton: Princeton University Press."
"Brun, Viggo. 1961. Muikk og Euklidske algoitmer. Nordisk
matematisk tidskrift 9: 29-36"
"Fokker, Adriaan. 1987. Selected Musical Compostiions. Ed.
Rudolf Rasch. Utrecht: Diapason Press."
"Mandelbaum, Joel. 1961. Multiple Divisions of the Octave
and the Tonal Resources of 19-Tone Equal Temperament. 
Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, no. 6104461."
"Rapoport, Paul. 1989. "Some Temperaments are More Equal
than Others...and Decidely More Temperamental. MusicWorks
43: 8-12."

--
We saw last post that Paul Rapoport's bibliography was
grossly deceptive--now it's time to demonstrate
that it is also atrociously incomplete.
Consider, for a start, Easley Blackwood.  He was Paul Rapoport's
teacher, and if anyone should be familiar with Blackwood's
articles and texts, you'd think Paul would be.
But not so.  Paul Rapoport incomprehensibly leaves out 
*the most important* of Blackwood's articles on 
equal temperaments:
[1] Blackwood, Easley. "Modes and Chord Progressions in
Equal Tunings," Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 29,
No. 2, 1992, pp. 167-200.
[2] Blackwood, Easley. Research Notes: NEH Grant R0-29376
-78-0642. Privately circulated handwritten xerox. 1981.
[3]  Blackwood, Easley. "Discovering the Microtonal Resources
of the Synthesizer," Keyboard, May 1982, pp. 26-38
[4] Blackwood, Easley. Liner notes for the LP "Twelve 
Microtonal Etudes" 1980.
[5] Genovese, Denny. "Easley Blackwood--An  Interview
by Denny Genovese, Part I," Interval, Vol. 3, No. 1, Spring
1981, pp. 16-21
[6] Genovese, Denny. "Easley Blackwood--An  Interview
by Denny Genovese, Part II," Interval, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer
1981, pp. 18-20
[7] "A Trailblazer tunes in to a musical discovery," John
von Rhein, Chicago Tribune Arts & Fun section, July 20, 
1980.
--
So let's see now...Paul Rapoport, who was taught by Easley
Blackwood, cites a grand total of 2 of Blackwood's texts.
Rapoport didn't bother to cite the *other* 7 sources.
2 sources out of 7.
Is this a reasonable percentage for the person who *taught*
Rapoport and stands as *the* major source on Paul's
attitude toward microtonality?
Paul leaves out the NEH Grant report, by *far* the most 
important of all of Blackwood's texts--in fact Blackwood's
1992 PNM article represents a tiny condensation of a mere
4 of the 11 chapters of this giant work.
Anyone who reads Paul's bibliography will come away with
the impression that the book "Structure of Recognizable
Diatonic Tunings" is Blackwood's most important work
on notating ETs, and the only text available.  This is so
obviously the *opposite* of the truth that it beggars
description.
To continue:
Paul Rapoport cites Viggo Brun's 1961 article, presumably
because Brun defines the properties of various classes
of equal temperaments using continued fractions.  But Rapoport
*fails* to cite Brun's *english-language* article on the same
subject: 
[1] Brun, Viggo,. "Euclidean Algorithms and music theory," 
L'esnseignement Mathematique Revue Internationale, 
tome X, fasc. 1-2, 1964, pp. 125-137.
And because Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite this vital
article, he *also* neglects to cite the *other* important
articles which characterize equal temperaments using
continued fraction methods, all cited in the bibliography of
Brun's english-language 1964 article:
[2] Brun, Viggo. Mehrdimensionale Algorithmen, welche die 
Eulersche Kettenbruchentwicklung der Zahle verallgemeinern,"
Leonard Euler zum 250. Geburtstag, 1959, Akademie-Verlag,
Berlin."
[3] Brun, Viggo. "Algorithmes euclidiens pour trois et quatre nombres,"
XIII Congr. Math. Scan. tenu a Helsinki, aout 1957
[4] brun, Viggo. "En Generalisation av kjedebro/ken I-II," Norske Vid.
Selk. Skr., 1919-20, Olso (avec des resumes en francais)
[5] Brun, Viggo. "Music and Ternary Continued Fractions," Nordisk
Matem. Tijdskrift, B.9, Oslo 1961
[6] Fokker, A. D. "Multiple Antanairesis," Koninkl. Nederl.
Akademie van Weteschappen, Amsterdam, Proc. Ser. A, 66, 
communicated October 27, 1962
[7] van der Waerden. "Die Harmonielehre der Ptyahgoreer,"
Hermes, Vol. 78, pp. 163-199
And since Rapoport cites one of Brun's continued fraction
articles,  why doesn't  he cite James Murray Barbour's 
article "Music and Ternary  Continued Fractions," American 
Mathematical Monthly, LV, 1948, pg. 545?  
Brun himself cites the Barbour article in the biblio of his
(Brun's) 1964 article. 
Barbour's article covers nearly exactly the same ground as 
Brun's--and if Brun's article is necessary, why is not Barbour's
article also necessary?
On the subject of continued fractions, the article "Musical Scale
Construction: the Continued Fraction Compromise," Utilitas
Mathematica, Vol. 42, pp. 97-113, 1992, is an even more
important source.  Yet Paul Rapoport blatantly ignores it.
Why?  
Is there some good reason for doing so?
Moritz Drobisch's book "Uber Musikalische Tonbestimmung und
Temperatur," Leipzig, Widmannsche Buchhandlung, 1852,
covers much the same ground.  Yet Paul Rapoport *also* fails
to cite this work.
Jacques Dudon's "La gamme doree: Un temperament inegal
issue du nombre d'or," in the collection "Nombre d'or
et Musique," 1987, pp. 147-157,  uses similar continued
fraction methods of sieving scales to obtain results similar
to Douthett, Drobisch, Blackwood, Barbour, Fokker, Hall,
Kronerup, et al.  Yet Paul Rapoport *fails* to cite *this* 
important source as well.
Speaking of Kornerup--
Thorwald Kornerup used exactly the same methods as
Barbour, Brun and Douthett to classify tuning systems
in 4 different articles: "Acoustic Valuation of Intervals,"
Thorwald Kornerup, Translated by Jean Ferguson, Copenhagen,
Aschehoug Forlag, 1934; "Von der Urform 5-Toniger Skalen zu
den Golden Tonen Elekstrischer Instrumente," Kopenhagen,
1931; "Kornerup, Throwald, "Die Hochteilung der Oktave,"
Kopenhagen, 1930; "Die Vorlaufer der gleichschwebende 
Temperaturen mit 19 oder 31 Tonen in der Oktave," Translated
from Danish to German by P. Friedrich Paulsen, Copenhagen,
J. Joergensen, 1930.
Why did Paul Rapoport fail to cite *these* equally important
sources on classifying equal temperaments?
Scanning Paul's bibliography, we find yet another GROSS
oversight--Donald Hall's name does not appear.  Yet Hall
has written four *important* articles on the classification of
equal temperaments: 
[1] Hall, Donald. "Acoustical Numerology and Lucky Equal 
Temperaments," American Journal of Physics,  Vol. 56, 1985
[2] Hall, Donald. "Quantitative Evaluation of Musical Scale Tuning," 
American Journal of Physics, Vol. 42, 1974. pp. 543-552
[3] Hall, Donald. "The Objective Measurement of Goodness-of-
Fit for Tunings and Temperaments," Journal of Music Theory,
Vol. 17, pp. 274-290, 1973
[4] Hall, Donald. "A Systematic Evaluation of Equal Tempermaents 
Through N=612," Interface, Vol. 14, 1985, pp. 61-73
 --
This is a *criminal* oversight, since it leads the unwary
reader to believe that Don Hall has nothing to say about
equal temperaments--when he in fact has a great deal
to say about 'em.
--
Since Paul Rapoport's article deals specifically with the notation
of equal temperaments, you'd expect that he'd cite other
basic texts on xenharmonic notation.  For example, Ivor Darreg's
Xenharmonic Bulletin No. 6, 1975, devoted *entirely* to
non-12 notation. 
Or "Notation for Non-Twelve," Ivor Darreg, Interval, 
Spring-Summer 1980, Vol. 1, pg. 12 "Notation For 
Non-Twelve - part 2," Ivor Darreg, Interval,
Fall 1980, pg. 7
At the very least, you'd expect Rapoport to cite Xenharmonic
Bulletin 5, 1975, by Ivor Darreg (the crucial bulletin in
which Ivor first wrote about the "moods" or "sounds" or
"sonic fingerprints" of each of the equal temperaments),
or Xenharmonic Bulletin 10, 1988, in which Ivor wrote
an exhaustive commentary on the advantages & disadvantages
of most of the tunings between 5t and 53 tones per octave.
--
And Paul Rapoport cites *not one single reference* by
Ivor Darreg.  This is beyond belief.  It's like writing an
article about visual art without mentioning painting.
It's incomprehensible.
And guess what?
It gets *worse*.
--
The veritable library of xenharmonic source
materials Paul Rapoport *should* have
cited and *didn't* include:

the very subject of Paul's article!--Equal temperaments
characterized by the "web of thirds and fifths.")

Intervals and Temperament," London, 1876 (this is
the origin of the "positive" and "negative" terminology

musical examples of chords which produce this effect)

"The Microtonal Notation Mess," Unpublished manscuript,

So let's count up the total number of sources cited in
Paul Rapoport's so-called "bibliography:" the grand total
is 9.
Yes, count 'em...9.
Now let's count up the total number that *weren't* cited
but *should have been.*
THAT total comes to 67.
Let me repeat that: Paul Rapoport should have cited sixty-seven
more references than he did.
Predictably, Paul Rapoport will claim that "he didn't have time"
to do a full biblio.  This is obviously false, since many of us
would have rapidly and efficently supplied the references to
him if he'd sent us a pre-print of the article.  
Again, predictably, Paul Rapoport will claim that the Journal
of Music Theory doesn't allow extensive bibliographies.  This
is provably incorrect, since many articles (viz., Lindley,
"Mersenne on Keyboard Tunings," 1980, etc.) cite lists of
bibliographic sources many pages in length.
Moreover, no journal ever turned down a music theory article
because the biblio was too long.  That's nonsense.  It just
doesn't happen.  And even if did (which is preposterous), Paul
could simply stand by his guns and publish the article in a
journal will *does* allow extensive bibliographies--and 
there are plenty of those.
No...the excuses don't wash. The only question now is whether
Paul Rapoport's bibliographies are so grossly inadequate because
(A) he just don't care, or (B) Paul deliberately wants to give
a false, inaccurate and slanted picture of microtonality to
his readers.
--
To call Paul's bibliography "incomplete" is like calling
what happened to the Titanic "a boating accident."  And to
call Paul's virtually nonexistent list of sources "adequate,"
as Paul presumably does, requires a capacity for fabulation
so hallucinatory as to make Terence McKenna balk.
---
Why does all this matter...?
It's well to remember the importance of bibliographies.
Bright-eyed students receive their first impetus & much of
their sense of direction for future study from a bibliography. 
Control the biblio & to a large extent you control the students'
education. A bibliography is the message in a bottle which
a wise music theory author sends out to readers not yet
born: a good bibliography can start an entire career, revolutionize
an entire field of study.  Just think of Partch--turned on to 
Helmholtz by a note in a bibliography.  Just think of the many 
composers and theorists turned on to Partch's "Genesis Of A 
Music" because of a mention in a bibliography.
Here's why this issue matters, ladies and gentlemen:
A crassly inadequate bibliography is tantamount to censorship.
It gouges out the eyes of the prospective student and punches
icepicks into hi/r ears.  An incomplete bibliography is a crime
against the future, a *savage chainsaw abortion* of nascent
microtonal composers while they're still in the womb.
Paul, don't you realize that people like Kami Rousseau and
Matthew Puzan read your bibliographies and search out the
references you cite?  By refusing to cite sources of basic
importance, you prevent these up-and-coming microtonalists
from discovering their heritage. You drive them into the arms
of the  likes of Paul Griffiths--who stated "If polytonality and
microtones offered limited extensions to musical possibility,
atonality opened vast new realms." [Griffiths, Paul, "A Concise
History of Avant Garde Music: from Debussy to Boulez," 
New York & Toronto, Oxford University Press, 1978, pg. 40]
Ye gods!
Since post-Webern atonality is now dead as a 
steamrollered cockroach, and microtonality is
continuing to gather steam as a world-wide trend...
wow!  Is it possible get any more  foolishly WRONG than 
good old Paul  Griffiths???
And THIS guy (who, in a 1994 review, called  the superb composer
Ivan Vyshnegradsky "almost insane") is STILL the "new music 
reviewer" for the New Yorker!!!
