Subject: In search of TD 1 through TD 80

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

Now that we've reached beyond TD 1000, I have a request for the
"old-timers" on this list (meaning those folks who have been on the list
since before TD 99 or so).  I've been on the Tuning List since TD 81 and
have maintained a personal archive of every digest issued since then.
As many of you may know, the tuning archive at Mills only has digests
from about TD 237.  Prior to that the archives are in huge monthly
chunks of messages.  What I'm looking for is someone who has tuning
digests prior to TD 81 (and is willing to send them to me) so that I can
complete my collection.  Crazy?  Perhaps, but I hope someone will
indulge my obsessive-compulsive quest and contact me directly with the
missing digests.  If folks wish, I'd be happy to supply the Mills
archive with individual digests prior to TD 237.

Thanks,
John
