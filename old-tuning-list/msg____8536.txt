   "Clueless in Phoenix":  Cute!

   The way it worked is that ten people contributed about $200 (I forgot
the exact amount) and 6-7 minutes of music, and Neil Haverstick put them
all together into a real 1000-run CD.  The goal then is that each of the
ten contributors gets about 100 of them that they may distribute as they
see fit.  So presumably you'll see contributors advertising them soon.

   Most likely we'll be selling them for something on the order of $10.
