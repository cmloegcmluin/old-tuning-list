Subject: which tuning is best/tuning in 34 eq

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Once again, Finnamore's comments are very interesting, but to me, 
the point is NOT which tuning resonates best with humanity (I am 
paraphrasing his comments). Sure, that is an issue, but once we have a 
tuning we like, can we COMPOSE something in it that is meaningful and 
profound? For example, and I hope I do not insult anyone here, I have an 
album by a pianist named Michael Harrison...he plays a piano tuned 
purely, and has 24 notes to the octave. In the liner notes, he talks very 
profoundly about the effects of pure tuning, and about his studies with 
various people in the field of pure tunings, etc. Only problem for me is 
this: on a musical, technical, compositional level, the album is 
incredibly boring because of the lack of interesting compositions and 
playing. The album seems to be composed of a few simple chordal motifs, 
with song structures that sound, to me, like ideas a beginning guitarist 
would come up with as he/she is discovering the harmonized major scale. 
And again, I am only trying to be honest here...I do not want to insult a 
fellow musician out of spite, or whatever...if I write something less 
than inspiring, I would expect someone to say so as well.
    OK...so the tuning is marvelous, in tune, and all that...now, write 
some music that is challenging, profound, and interesting on deep levels. 
I, at this stage of my career, am not impressed by basic chordal 
structures that sound like a beginning musician. The craft of composition 
is deep and challenging, and is a subject that many folks have not done a 
whole lot with. Simplicity is fine, but simple music does not necessarily 
mean cliched or unimaginative. Again, that is my main complaint about a 
lot of "just" music...it sounds like the composer is more fascinated with 
the purity of the tuning, rather than the final result of the 
composition.
    As far as tuning my 34 tone guitar...I approach this stuff fairly 
intuitively, so here's what I do. I tune it like a regular 12 tone 
instrument (as I do all of my guitars, 19 and 31 as well). This means the 
following: the B string is in tune with the  two E strings, and is the 
5th of said strings. When I play a G chord, the open B string is one 
increment sharp (comma) to the G, so I have to flat this B by one fret to 
be in tune on the G chord. Because of my background in blues (32 years), 
many of the things I like to do involve riffs/patterns that are based off 
of the "standard" 12 tone tuning...I don't want to mess with changing 
that phenomenon at this stage of my career, so I work within that 
framework...on 34, this is really tricky because of said comma, but it is 
a personal choice, and works well for me...others may have better luck 
with alternative ways of tuning...and what DOES Catler do, by the 
way, when he tunes his axe?...Hstick
