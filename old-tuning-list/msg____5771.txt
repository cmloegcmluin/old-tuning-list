Although this is the most familar scheme (Riemann, Tanaka, Johnston,
Tenney), it is often useful not to lock in the identity of a given
dimension with a given generating element. For example, I might - like LaMonte Young - want to use sevens but no fives. Why should I have to speakin terms of four dimensions when I am only using three? Or, in the other
direction, I might choose to treat nine as a separate dimension from three,
in which case, Partch's diamond is viewed as six-dimensional rather than
the five yielded by counting  primes. Let's reserve ''dimension'' for thenumber of dimensions on the graph independent of the particular intervalsto which they are assigned.
