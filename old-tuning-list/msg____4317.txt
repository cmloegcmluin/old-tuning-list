Subject: There was no pudding.

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Thanks, Jonathan (S), for reviewing the Southern California Microtonal
Group's latest concert.  

   I must confess that, regretably, I have to agree (from tapes Brian has
sent me) with your impression of the Southern California Microtonal Group's
improvs.  And this isn't unique to them either.  I think Neil is right that
many of us tend to ramble in our improvs.  Much of it has little drama. 
When each improv ends I have little understanding of why it should have
ended there rather than a few minutes earlier, or later.  That's much of
the reason why I stick to planned composition.  My own improvs aren't any
better.  

   I've been trying to interpret these sorts of works in a different light
though.  An ambient-music kind of light.  Perhaps it works better that way,
but I'll be honest with you:  Few of those improvs compel me to give them
more than one listening to let me find that ethic.  And I suppose it's
pretty obvious that the idea of an ambient-music concert is, by definition,
meaningless.  

   That line is a hard one to draw though.  A few months ago, I picked up a
copy of Cultrane's "Interstellar Regions".  Without a doubt I need to
develop a new music-listening ethic to understand it.  Most of the
individual parts in each title of that CD don't seem to have a lot to do
with each other either.  I'm certainly willing (when I have the time) to
give it several more good hard listens to try to find that required
music-listening ethic.  Perhaps I ought to give the SCMG's improvs more
time too.  

   But I believe there a silver lining to the SCMG's works though.  

   I get the strong sense that the Group's members tend to cancel each
other out.  Brian McLaren's and Jeff Stayton's own PRECOMPOSED music, I
think anyway, is pretty good stuff.  Jonathan's work with vocal harmonics
is very entertaining, and he certainly got the audience boogying in El Paso
recently!  And without a doubt, Bill Wesley has some really fantastic
instrument-building ideas.  And even when they work together, I have heard
interesting timbres and textures in the tapes Brian has sent me, and I
think I can learn from them.  But I sadly regret to say that I find the
high points in their improvs far too rare.  

   I personally think that the improvisors among us would be well served to
predesignate some more structure to their works.  There's value for
improvisationalists to start each improv with:
1.  A series of preintended and prepracticed underlying melodies and chord 
    progressions.  
2.  A predesignated overall impression of what feeling we're trying for
(fun, 
    lost in space, renaissancish sound, romantic, sad, frightening, or 
    whatever).  
3.  A high-level outline of how the music is to procede - where the high 
    points in the drama will be, and with what melodic and chordal
resources 
    they'll achieve that, where the loud and soft points will be, and so 
    forth.
