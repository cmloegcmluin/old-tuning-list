Subject: Crying "wolf".

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Jonathan Walker has got his history right, but terminology often has a life
of its own, and now, following my Webster's Collegiate, the _wolf_ for
tuning is **a dissonance in some chords on organs, pianos, or other
instruments with fixed tones tuned by unequal temperament**, or **an
instance of such dissonance** (there is also a definition for the faulty
tones in certain stringed instruments, and the usual stuff about _canus
lupus_). I think we should accept the broader definition of _wolf_that
describes an effect or category of effects, rather than specific intervals,
and when we intend a specific interval it would be best just to give the
ratio itself. 

This is tangential to another subject that has often concerned me: In
general, I am not a fan of invented terminology, and I think that an
informal neologism ban treaty within the tuning community would be of great
benefit to the public profile of our enterprise. The existing musical,
mathematical, and physical vocabulary is surely adequate and precise enough
for our modest needs!
