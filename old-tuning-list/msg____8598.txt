Subject: Re: forum CD

From: csz@wco.com (Carter Scholz)

Gary Morrison made a good suggestion about distributing the forum CD;
he proposed that if you order one, you order it from the person you
know best, or the person closest to you geographically.  Since each
of the contributors will have 80-100 CDs to distribute, I think this
is a fair way to ensure that each of us has a chance to sell some
without getting into price wars, repeated postings, etc.

My address is:  Carter Scholz/ 2665 Virginia St/ Berkeley CA 94709.
And I will echo Gary's suggested price of $10 including postage.

May I also suggest that we post a complete list of contributors'
addresses?  Perhaps Neil has such a list and would be willing to post
it here.
