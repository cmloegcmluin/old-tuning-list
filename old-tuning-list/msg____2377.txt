Subject: FFT Analysis Software

From: wabi@server.net4you.co.at (Helmut Wabnig)

There is a PC Program " Spectra Plus 3.0 "
by Pioneer Hill Software.
It analyzes .WAV files in several ways, has filtering,
windowing, averaging, waterfall, etc. etc.
Pointing with the mouse is not quite perfect, I have
to zoom out a part of the record, copy it into the
clipboard and load it back from there. Or I let the=20
recording pass by in slow motion and stop it at the point
of interest. This is a minor drawback.
The program works with sound cards and WAV files.
I can measure FFT frequencies about 0.02 Hz accurate.
I use it to check the tunings of CD recorded music.
Price is about $ 400 and a demo disk is about $ 20.

There are several high-level instrumentation systems,
i.e. electronic control and measuring software which
require expensive A/D cards eg. LABVIEW, DASYLAB, all in=20
the price range >3000 =A7. They are very professional
but difficult to handle.
