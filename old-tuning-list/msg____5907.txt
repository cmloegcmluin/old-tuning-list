The idea of "expressive intonation" arises from the use of strict
microtonalism which often becomes so specific that the performer has no
room for interpretation by means of pitch shifting, vibrato, portamento,
etc.  When the composer specifies exactly which pitch s/he wants from a
gamut of 31 or 1200 or more steps-per-octave, musicality often gets thrown
out of the window.  Expressive intonation is not a system, but just an
issue that may be addressed by a vague-ness in the notation, a program
note, or other ways that best suit your music.  I assume that most
people who work with equal temperaments will want to limit this as much
as possible, (which still allows for expressiveness in articulation,
rhythm, dynamics, etc.).  In my music, I have been working on finding good
ways to use Extended Just Intonation as a goal, while giving the performer
a chance to show their musicality.  This is much the same as standard
tonal music performance-practice, except that it accepts higher
overtone-relationships as consonances.
