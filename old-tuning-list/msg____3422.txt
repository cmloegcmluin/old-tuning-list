Subject: Chomsky's famous sentence

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Greg Taylor is probably referring to "Colorless green ideas sleep
furiously." (There's at least one piece of music with this title--I don't
recall by whom.) Whether or not it's Chomsky's I can't recall--my days in
linguistics pretty much ended a few years after "Aspects of a Theory of
Syntax," which means nearly 30 years ago (unfortunately). 

The ongoing conversation between Paul Erlich and me on this list may
continue--here or elsewhere--I've been out of town and very busy. I thank
him again for his insights... 

The basic diagrams on Erv Wilson's CPSs may be found in Xenharmonikon 12. 
Erv's article is short on explanation, however. His use of 1/1 may be 
found at odds with Brian McLaren's, but there is nothing wrong with 
fiddling with the ratios in a number of ways, as Brian points out.

My article on Erv's system in MusicWorks 60 is fairly rudimentary and 
specific to one particular tuning. There's much it omits and much I 
still don't know about the CPSs. Thanks to Brian for mentioning the article.
