My offer to look into the possibility of a conference here was inspired not
so much by a preference for this geographical location as opposed to San
Diego or San Francisco, both lovely cities, but for the possibility of
institutional support: meeting rooms, lecture halls with computers and a/v
equipment, concert halls, a secretary to do mailings and other conference
business, brochures, publicity, even (should we want to go that route) a
special dinner or something of that sort.

Some people may have well-grounded suspicions of the drawbacks of academia,
but these are some of the pros that a college site can provide. Of course
there are alternatives to this model, and I'm open to other people's
preferences. But if a conference of this sort in the LA area is still of
interest to enough people, I will be happy to continue pursuing the
possibility.

(By the way, my college is not actually in LA, but in Claremont, about 25
miles east of downtown.)
