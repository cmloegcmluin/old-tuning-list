Subject: Xenharmonic melodic theory vs. harmonic theory
--
In Tuning Digest 715 James McCartney suggested:

This is one opinion.
Another opinion is that western music theory is already overburdened
with theories of harmonic progression and voice leading.  After
a thousand years of obsessing over harmony to the utter exclusion
of melodic theory, it seems to me long past time to concern ourselves
with horizontal structures.
Clearly, James McCartney has another opinion--and quite a lot of 
justification for it. Harmony has traditionally be considered a
more fundamental subject for music theory than melody.
The question is whether this notion is valid. 
There is at least one musical culture which elevated melodic theory
far above harmonic theory: classical Greece.
As best we  can ascertain, the Greek thought melodic theory infinitely 
more fundamental to music than the theory of vertical intervals.
Were the Greeks right or wrong?
No way to tell.  The question may not even be meaningful, given the
iridescence and multidimensionality of the act of composing music.
In the meantime, I shall continue in my posts to emphasize
melody over harmony, the better to  redress the long-standing 
theoretical imbalance twixt the two.

Also in Tuning Digest 715 McCartney posted:

McCartney may not have seem 'em, but many *many* such posts exist.
About a year ago I posted a long series of compositional ideas and
compositional techniques for non-12 tunings.  Warren Burt has also
posted many such ideas, as have other forum subscribers.  Gary Morrison
has posted quite a few discussions on xenharmonic composition.
It might be advisable for newer subscribers to read over past digests
before they post.  People who've been on this forum for some time
would probably not appreciate it if I (or others) were to continually
re-post old messages for the benefit of the newer subscribers.
If James can't find those older posts on compositional ideas &
techniques in non-12 tunings, I can easily re-post them, however.
If there's sufficient interest, I can also post articles by Ivor Darreg
on compositional techniques in various non-12 intonations.  Ivor
was a vertibale fountain of new ideas for xenharmonic composition,
and his articles on the subject are a "must-read" for budding
xenharmonists.

Also in TD 715, Greg Scheimer asked for Csound compositions
in non-12 intonations.  I have a few of 'em, but they're long--
in excess of 100 kilobytes of ASCII.  Thus it seemed inadvisable
to post them on the Mills ftp site, since Dave Madole is already
fighting the Attack Of The Files That Ate My Disk.
Another issue supervenes, however: 
Many of the subscribers to this forum have done non-12 Csound
compositions, but they're reluctant to give out scores for
copyright reasons.  I myself requested a number of subscribers
to post Csound scores of their microtonal computer music
compositions.
Every single composer demurred, citing copyright concerns.
