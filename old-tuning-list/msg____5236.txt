On the contrary, I feel that there are aspects of metaphysics that have
great bearing on music in general and tuning specifically.  In David
Tame's book, The Secret Power of Music, Destiny Books, Rochester, VT,
1984, there is much evidence that 1) music has a profound impact upon the
physical, emotional amd mental, and "spiritual" nature of men and women
and 2) that the nature of the music dictates the nature of the effect.

"There is scarcely a single function of the body which cannot be affected
by musical tones."(p 136)

"So real and open to practical usage are music's psychological influences
that the art has been applied throughout the ages in order to bring about
emotional and mental effects."(p. 145)

I believe it is very important to explore this aspect of our
experimentation with tuning--the early experimenters with radioactive
materials were ignorant of its effects and suffered the consequences of
their ignorance.

Because there is limited scientific research in this area should not
preclude our exploring what is known and thoughtful speculation about such
effects--though I agree that unbridled speculation can waste alot of time.
I believe there is alot of evidence over the centuries that points towards
far reaching and subtle effects of music and its influence over men.
