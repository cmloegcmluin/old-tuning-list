Subject: Microtones in the news

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Both Rod Poole and I received reviews of our CD's in the new issue of 
Dirty Linen magazine (June/July 98); you will find them on p.70. It's 
obvious the reviewer knows little about the subject, but did his best. 
I've always felt if the press doesn't kill you or make you look stupid, 
you've "escaped." I am grateful to have escaped again...Hstick

    Also...the forum CD inches towards it's destiny. Starrett just 
completed his tracks today, and I'm awaiting Alves' dat; I also have a 
solo to overdub on Ernie Crews' piece, and it's off to the presses...
