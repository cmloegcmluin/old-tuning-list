   Hopefully Lucy will respond himself, but I suspect his response will be
that you're deluding yourself, and that the cyclic relationships of his
"pi-based" meantone are what our ears really understand.  As with you Neil,
I too find that very difficult to buy, but apparently at least one person
in this world disagrees...

   I think he'd prefer you to buy his book!
