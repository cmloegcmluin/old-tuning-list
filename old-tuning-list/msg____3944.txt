Subject: Pitch Bend Tuning

From: asouter@scf.usc.edu (Andrew Souter)

Friends,

        Doesn't anyone know the details about pitch bend tuning on a K2000?
Can someone just tell me the details about using pitch bend to tune in
general?  I assume that in order to do so, one must know the kind of
details which I asked about in my last post.  Gary Morison, seems to agree
in his response to a different question which contained the following:

"2.  As far as I can tell from the MIDI spec, there is no standard amount of
    pitch deflection that a give amount of change in pitch-wheel value should
    produce.  I would not be surprised if there is a defacto standard, perhaps
    whatever the DX-7 does or something to that effect.  Similarly, I know of
    no guarantee that all instruments will bend pitch consistently with each
    other.  By that I mean that, best I can tell from the MIDI spec alone at
    least, some instruments could bend pitch in proportion to frequency, some
    in proportion to log frequency, and some in proportion to period, if they
    so desire.  Again, there may be a defacto standard that will save you.

   Perhaps somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.  "

        Has anyone successfully found out these sort of details for any
specific synths.  I know on the K2000 at least, the response to pitch bend
messages is scalable from 1 cent to 7200 cents for full MIDI value of 8192.
But does that mean that if it is set to 1 cent that the Kurzweil has a
hardware tuning resolution of 1/1892 cents?  It seems highly unlikely.  So
how does one find out how specific instruments respond to pitch bend, and
how their hardware tuning is implemented?   Could someone please address my
previous post, and at least tell me that no one knows if that is the case
so that I may then track down the engineers?

        Any information form anyone with even the slightest relevance would
be greatly appreciated.  We need to figure these details out.

        Oh, and in honor of good old Pandora, does anyone know what the
current status of ZIPI is?
        And has anyone used the tonality functions in Peter Stone's
Symbolic Composer?

Safe Journey...
