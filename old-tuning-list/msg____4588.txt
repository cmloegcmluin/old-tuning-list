   Sorry for, in my last reply, launching into one of my lectures about the
much more general topic of limits and systematization from this statement
by Paul E.  I probably sidetracked the topic a bit, and may have (or may
not have) put some words into Paul's mouth.

   But I think that Paul is certainly correct about this:  Although at
first glance imposing an organization upon tuning would seem to limit your
freedom, limits of this sort can actually stimulate creativity.  

   But such a systematization, on my opinion anyway, doesn't necessarily
have to imply a fixed set of pitches, although it certainly could.  As with
meantone or JI, it could equally well imply a certain size of major third
or fifth used consistently with an indefinite number of pitches per octave.
 

   I'd probably better hush up before I start sounding like a fanatic!
