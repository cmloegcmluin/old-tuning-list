Subject: when truncated

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.or.jp>

Hi! & Thanx for reply,

Can I ask a bit more?
Maybe this is just like asking how bits work in computer but.. 
actually..I don't know how it goes..

>QuickTime 2.5 (built-in Macintosh software synthesizer) uses 9 bits

Oh my Buddah!
Then...

You mean I have to recalculate by myself?
Or does QT automatically take me to the nearest value?
In other word ... does higher bit does the 'more' fine tunings?...I mean 
when 5 bits truncated ... the remaining 9 is not "not correct" but just 
robust?...hope so...

Thanx in advance...again
