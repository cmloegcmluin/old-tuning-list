Wait a minute, Daniel, how can your average deviation be negative? I want to 
know the average ABSOLUTE deviation, or the root mean square deviation if 
you prefer. If you throw enough darts at a dartboard, the "average" position 
is the bullseye, but that doesn't mean you ever came close to the bullseye. 
If your average position with the red darts was closer to the bullseye than 
with the blue darts, you could have still been much closer to the bullseye 
on the average throw of a blue dart than on the average throw of a red dart.
