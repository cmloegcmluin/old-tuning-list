The evidence for a universal human preference for stretched intervals is
so overwhelming that it appears throughout the length and breadth
o`e psychoacoustic literature, both with Western and non-Western
musicians:
"Dowland has reported that measurements of Western and non-Western fixed 
pitch instruments suppprt Ward's conclusion that the perceptual octave is 
some 15 cents larger than the  physical or mathematical octave.  Western 
musical practice supports these conlusions (play sharp in higher octave). 
Balinese gamelan tunings take advantage of this apparently widespready 
characteristic of pitch perception to create a multi-octave beating ocmplex 
in their fixed pitch instruments."  [Erickson, Robert, "Timbre and the Tuning 
of the Balinese Gamelan," Soundings, pg. 100, 1984]
Particularly revealing is "The 1215-Cent Octave: Convergence of Western and Non-Western  Data on Pitch Scaling,"  W. J. Dowling, Abstract QQ5, 84th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, Friday, December 1, 1972, p. 101 of program.
Yet more evidence for a universal preference for stretched octaves comes
from Sundberg, who found that the octave was as a rule played 
significantly sharp by performing musicians, and was also preferred sharp 
of the 2:1 in adjustment tests:
"Evidently the octave intervals in such stretched scales will exceed a 2:1 
frequency ratio slightly. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
*physical octave * (PO) which is defined as a 2:1 frequency ratio, and the 
*subjective (musical) octave * (MO) that is perceived as pure.  (...) As a rule, 
the perceptual octave corresponds to a fundamental frequency ratio 
exceeding 2:1." [Sundberg, J. and Lindqvist, J., "Musical Octaves and Pitch," 
JASA, 54(4), 1973, pp. 973-929]
Among the many implausible arguments which attempt to explain away this 
mountain of experimental evidence for a preference for an octave interval 
larger than the purportedly "pure" 2:1, most prevalent is the claim that 
these "laboratory experiments do not represent real musical practice."  
If this objection is correct, why does computer analysis of the frequencies 
of pitches played during actual performances which show a uniform stretch 
of the octave also show the same results as the laboratory psychoacoustic 
experiments?  And why do psychoacoustic measurements and experiments 
stretching back over 150 years uniformly produce the same results?
"This disparity between the physical and subjective octaves is not a new 
discovery.  Stumpf and Meyer, using the method of constant stimuli, had 18 
subjects judge pairs of successive tones as greater than, less than, or equal 
to an octave.  They lower tone was 300 cps and the upper tone was varied 
around 600 cps.  They found that 602 cps (the higher upper tone used) 
received 52 percent "less," 43 precent "equal," and 5 percent "greater" 
responses from the group, indicating that the mean subjective octave of 300 
cps was somewhere above 602 cps (the present Fig. 4 gives about 605 cps). 
Later von Maltzew, in an investigation on the identification of intervals in 
the upper frequency range, found that a physical octave was more often 
called a major seventh or below than a minor ninth or above. See C. Stumpf 
and M. Meyer, Beit. Akust. Musikw., Vol. 2 ppg. 84-167, 1898. C. v. Malzew, Z. 
Psychol. Vol. 64, pp. 16-257, 1913. [Ward., W.D., "Subjective Musical Pitch," 
Journ. Acoust. Soc. Am. , Vol. 26, No. 3, May 1954, pg. 374]
"The average standard deviation of repeated adjustments of sequential or 
simultaneous octaves composed of sinusoids is on the order of 10 cents 
(Ward, 1953, 1954; Terhardt, 1969; Sundberg & Lindquist, 1973).  A range of 
average deviations from 4 to 22 cents for adjustments of the other 
intervals of the chromatic scale (simultaneous presentation) has been 
reported by Moran and Pratt (1926). Rakowski (1976) reports variability--in 
interquartile ranges--of 20 to 40 cents for both ascending and descending 
melodic versions of the 12  chromatic intervals. Other general trends 
evident from the results of adjustment experiments are...a tendency to 
'compress' smaller intervals (adjust narrower than equal-tempered 
intervals) and "stretch" wider intervals (adjust wider)."  [Burns, E. M., and 
Ward, W.D., "Intervals, Scales and Tuning," in The Psychology of Music, ed. 
Diana Deutsch, 1982, pg. 250.]
"A number of measurements have been made of the intonation of musicians 
playing variable-tuning instruments under actual performance conditions 
(e.g., Greene, 1937; Nickerson, 1948; Mason, 1960; Shackford, 1961, 1962, a, 
b). The results of these measurements have been summarized by Ward 
(1970). They show a fairly large variability for the tuning of a given 
interval in a given performance--ranged of up to 78 cents, interquartile 
values of up to 38 cents. The mean values of interval tunings, in general, 
show no consistent tendency to either just intonation or Pythagorean 
intonation in either melodic or harmonic situations.  The general tenedency  
seems to be to contract the semitone and slightly expand all other intervals 
relative to equal temperament.  There is also some evidence of context-
dependent effecst (e.g., to play F# sharper than Gb (Shackford, 1962 a,b)]. 
Those results mirror, to a certain extent, the results of the adjustment and 
identification experiments using isolated intervals (discussed in Sections 
III A and III B) which showed a tendency to compress the scale for small 
intervals and stretch the scale for large intervals, in both ascending and 
descending modes of  presentation. 
"The above measurements were obtained for Western classical music, but 
the same general tendencies are evident in intonation form a military band 
(Stauffer, 1954),  Swedish folk musicians (Fransson, Sundberg & Tjernland, 
1970), and jazz daxophonists (Owes, 1974). Measurements of intonation 
inperformance for Indian (Hindustani) classical music (jairazbhoy & Stone, 
1963; Callow and Shepard, 1972) show similar variability." [Burns, E. M., and 
Ward, W.D., "Intervals, Scales and Tuning," in The Psychology of Music, ed., 
Diana Deutsch, 1982, pg. 258.]
"Even the ubiquitous 5th itself is played, on the average, sharper than the 
702 cents predicted; indeed, in Shackford's study, it is played sharpest in a 
harmonic context, where the minimization-of-beat forces would be 
expected to be the most active." (...) Thus evidence indicates strongly that in 
musical performances the target pitch for frequencies actually produced in 
response to a given notation is one that is just a shade sharper than that 
called for by Et.  In the 500 and 1000 Hz regions, even the subjective octave 
(sacrosanct 2:1 in all theoretical systems) is about 1210 cents for pure 
tones (Ward, 1954). In his studies, Shackford (1962 a,b) measured harmonic 
10th, 11th and 12th and found that they were sharped to about the same 
extent as 3rd, 4tha nd 5th.
"Boomsliter and Creel (1963) too have provided striking confirmation of this 
theory. (...) ...it is clear from the sample dat they present aththe preferred 
scale almost always is composed of tones consistently higher in frequency 
than those of ET. For example, in three classical numbers (the Marseillaise, 
a Bartok dance, and Mozart's Serenta Notturna), all notes above "do" are 
preferred 4 to 23 cents sharp." [Ward, W.D., "Musical Perception," in 
"Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory," ed. J.V. Tobias, Vol. 1,  pp. 420-
421]

The next post will examine data bearing on the third theory of hearing--
a model of the ear so far not dealt with as extensively as the other two.
