From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%0005695065@MCIMAIL.COM>

Paul R,

I would like to see your acquaintance's work on srutis. I have recently 
scoured the entire Harvard music library for every speculation and shred of 
evidence on their tuning, for my paper on 22-tone temperament. I was pleased 
to find some of my original speculations, such as the tempered tuning of the 
sruti representing kakali-ni in sa-grama and antara-ga in ma-grama, to be 
repeated by several authors and evidenced in the construction of ancient 
instruments. I would be pleased to offer comments on your acquaintance's 
paper. I did not respond originally because I figured someone would be more 
of an expert in this area than I.

Now for the other issue:

NO, IT'S NOT OBVIOUS AT ALL! In any ET, we would agree that the perfect 
fifth is the closest approximation to the 3:2. We would also agree that the 
syntonic comma is NOT necessarily the closest approximation to the 81:80 -- 
for example, in 22-tET the closest step size to an 81:80 is 0 steps, and yet 
we would both call 1 step the syntonic comma. Why? Because the syntonic 
comma is defined as interval obtained by tuning several successive CONSONANT 
intervals. The two important definitions are as follows:

(1) Tune up three perfect fourths, down an octave, and down a minor third. 
You are now a syntonic comma lower than where you began. In 22-tET, this is 
1 step.

(2) Tune up four perfect fifths, down two octaves, and down a major third. 
You are now a syntonic comma higher than where you began. In 22-tET, this is 
1 step.

So the syntonic comma is 1 step in 22-tET, even though 0 steps would be 
closer in size to the JI syntonic comma. This situation would never occur 
for a basic consonace like the perfect fifth. Thus the "pseudo" terminology 
is warranted.

Now there are tunings where (1) and (2) give different answers! For example, 
in 21-tET, definition (1) gives a syntonic comma of 0 steps, while 
definition (2) gives an syntonic comma of -1 (that's minus 1) steps. Another 
example is 20-tET, where definition (1) gives a syntonic comma of 1 step, 
while definition (2) gives a syntonic comma of 2 steps. So I would argue 
that if an ET is not consistent within the 5-limit, the syntonic comma is 
undefined in that tuning.
