No, a key is a set of 7 pitches in a (at least nominal) series consecutive
of fifths, octave equivalence assumed, and auxillary accidentals allowed.This contributes the pitch height component of the identification of a mode
of a piece. Our terminology for this is not so transparent, in that
traditionally the tonic is named verbally and the set of pitches identified
by the key signature. Thus the key with two flats gives Bb Major, g minor(with or without auxillaries - a look at Baroque minor key signatures is
instructive), c dorian, d phrygian etc..

Major and minor tonalities have distinctive harmonic possibilities from
harmonized church modes, and these are manifest in particular harmonic
sequences. For example, a phrygian harmonization will have a different
treatment of the second degree from that found in major or minor. (A V ofV
- V - I sequence is very different in these modes and that is exactly thefeature that Schumann or Berlioz or Sibelius grabs onto!).

Since I have had to do some church organ playing of late in a church
(Altkatholische) where Lutheran chorales are used, I have been struck by
the variety of harmonizations. Most settings are modal (i.e. retaining the
dominant/tonic functions of the melodic mode), but some - particularly
those of Bach - put the melody into a Major/minor tonality with elaboratecross relations and usually are slowed down considerably to accommodate the
rapid increase in harmonic rhythm. Indeed, although the congregation onlysings the melody, the ''tonal'' harmonizations make the melody harder to
sing at the more familiar tempo.     Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
