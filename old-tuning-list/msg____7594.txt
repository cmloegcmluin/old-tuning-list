Paul Hahn's completeness and diameter concepts are excellent
characterizations of consistent equal temperaments. Congratulations
Paul!

I know my piece on the Tuning Digest Tape/CD, which utilizes long
microchromatic passages in 22TET, is only possible because 22 is
complete at the 7-limit and has a small diameter.
