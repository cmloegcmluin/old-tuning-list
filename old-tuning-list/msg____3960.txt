Subject: Re: News 7ET Citings

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I just came across an incredible book - Bagpipes and Tunings - by Theodor 
H. Podnos (Detroit 1974).  Since tuning Larry Cole's Spanish bagpipe, I 
have become introduced to some new perspectives on the role of the 
bagpipe in the world.  Podnos states that the immense variety of bagpipe 
tunings indicate ancient pitch arrangements worldwide that are no longer 
in practice among other instruments.  This is due in part because the 
exactitude of pipe tunings (since their is no embochure to alter an 
objective pitch description) rarely in in interplay with other instruments.

Regarding new evidence of 7ET (in addtion to the Thai, 'Are'are, Puna, 
and central African peoples - especially in Cameroun), there is the 
following by Podnos:

"During the fifteenth century, Italian bagpipes were probably tuned in 
accordance with equi-distant heptatonc scale formations.  These 
intervallic measurements have also been used up to the present by bagpipe 
players of Miranda do Douro in northeastern Portugal.  Such exotic 
tunings have been regarded by musicologists as remnants of ancient or 
medieval music."

I have included 7ET in my music several times, often in combination with 
5ET, in Cosmic Rays, Alternity for double bass, and Millennium (in the 
finale for tenor sax, violin, and bassoon).
