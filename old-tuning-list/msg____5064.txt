John C.,
	    Perhaps you didn't see what I was trying to do with the optimal 
positive temperaments I proposed. The idea is that we are optimizing the 
_diatonic_ dominant seventh chord with respect to a tuning of 4:5:6:7 by 
minimizing the weighted or unweighted mean of the squared errors of all six 
intervals in that chord. No schismatic thirds, augmented sixths, etc. are 
used.
	    There is a discussion currently about whether the 4:5:6:7 is the 
classical dominant seventh chord and whether it is too consonant. In most 
cases I would say that 4:5:6:7 should not be used for the dominant seventh 
and therefore a negative tuning such as meantone is best, as only the triads 
should be rendered as consonant as possible. But there are other styles for 
which diatonic dominant sevenths or minor 6th (that means minor with an 
added major 6th) chords are tonics, and should be tuned accordingly. My 
results indicate that mildly positive tunings are better for such styles. 
12-tET is a compromise that leans slightly toward the latter; in fact I 
think it unlikely that mixolydian and dorian would have achieved their 
current popularity had a negative system become standard in Western music.
