Subject: Re: Systematizing Tuning Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

As sometimes occurs, definitions (or lack of them in this case) can get
in the way of understanding.  Sorry if I didn't explain my premises well
enough.

   Unlike Lucy's scenario, I'm not refering to a single system of tuning
for every possible musical expression.  Certainly each system has its own
strengths and weaknesses for each sort of expression.  

   I'm refering to systems in the sense of choosing pitches for a
composition based on a clearly-recognizable (more or less consciously) set
of pitch relationships.  That could, for example, take the form of an
equal-temperament paradigm.  That as opposed to some essentially arbitrary
spacing, or each appearance of what is essentially the same pitch-class
taking on a somewhat different pitch with no apparent reasoning behind it. 


   Of course I suppose that could be useful on occasion.  Those occasions
would - best I can tell - mostly be cases where you want the results to be
confusing or hard to follow.  It would perhaps be kind of like walking
blindfolded on rocky terrain:  You never know exactly the height of your
next step!  That could perhaps have an interesting musical effect.  

   But looking up to the bigger question, I personally find value in
composing music with the approach of creating a musical environment
including pitch, instrumentation, and style, and then working in that
environment.  Many of the more exciting musical devices composer's disposal
come from devising brilliant ways of "stretching the limits".  Some of
Stravinsky's orchestral colors are examples of that, they show insightful
ways of using familiar resources to produce surprising results.  That makes
audiences say "wow!".  

   Well its obviously very difficult to cleverly stretch the limits if you
afford yourself no limits to start with!  If your resources are infinite,
then the effect is somewhat more of, "well, so what if you achieved that
effect; who couldn't, given infinite resources?"  Systematizing tunings can
provide just such a limit to stretch, if you use it correctly.  

   I guess people don't want to take too many axioms for granted;  people
seem to be more interested in clever combinations of a small number of
accepted resources, than in "inventing a new particle" - justifying a new
idea by just saying that it's axiomatically valid.
