Subject: Sonics Arts Gallery concert

On Friday, 5 November, Your Humble E-Mail
Correspondent gave a concert along with Jonathan
Glasier at the Sonic Arts Gallery in San Diego.
The program consisted of:
[1] Dual pianos tuned to different 12-pitch subsets
of 34/oct.  With J. Glasier on one piano and myself
on another, we explored 34-tone equal temperament
in a piece which sounded as though one person was
playing, albeit with superhuman facility.  By judiciously
switching MIDI channels during the piece to obtain the
third 12-tone set of 34-equal, the entire 34/oct scale
was covered.
[2] The second piece also featured Glasier and YHC on
dual MIDI keyboards--this time using a 5 and a 7-pitch
subset of 34-TET with gamelan-like timbres.  The
general effect was that of a digital trip to Bali.
[3] The third piece used harmonic series 1-60 for
an old favorite, also played at last year's sonic arts
gallery concert series.  A staple concert piece, extremely
xenharmonic.
[4] The fourth piece used a TX802 harmonium timbre 
and a cello to explore Harry Partch's 43-tone just array
[5] In the fifth piece, a vibraphone timbre counterpointed
pizzicato cello--also in Partch 43.
[6] The fifth piece juxtaposed exotic synth timbres in
the Carlos Gamma non-octave scale against Tibetan bells,
waterphone, and struck pieces of scrap metal to generate
an eerie and unfamiliar sound-world.  This may be the
first time Carlos Gamma has been performed at a public
concert.
All told, the concert was a success.  In attendance: Ted
Melnechuk, the xenharmonist Ralph David Hill, and a variety
of other sonically adventurous folk.  
The placement of contact mike on the cello did not produce
good recordings of the Partch pieces, but the other concert
pieces were recorded on digital tape and will form part of
a forthcoming compilation tape.
