Subject: Paul's postings

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

It is interesting that in a recent posting, Paul Erlich seems to admit th=
e
role of conditioning in interval preference. I think that this and a
broader contextual base are necessary elements in a useful theory. (By a
''broader contextual base'', I mean to include alternative musical contex=
ts
and in particular those that allow for longer listening periods. Clearly,=
 a
classical _Presto_ is going to allow for shorter sampling periods than a
music with a 24-hour drone. In the latter case, a difference of a fractio=
n
of a cent may become vivid.)

Regarding the spectra of real string instruments: I tried a small
experiment with my Javanese rebab, an e-bow, a band-pass filter and a
frequency counter. Driving each brass string with the e-bow so as to redu=
ce
deviations caused by bowing, I then isolated individual partials, and
measured so as to compare with integer multiple frequencies. I found
deviations as follows: octave: +4cents, -5 cents; twelfth: +5cents, +4
cents, double octave: -3cents, +8cents.

I suspect that what is going on is the following: the wire would like to
vibrate in exact integer multiples, but the composition of the wire is
uneven enough that the nodal points are shifted a bit and the actual
frequency of the partial heard reflects the actual length of the part of
the string closest to the bridge. =


I suspect that the deviation in gut strings would be larger due to greate=
r
inconsistancies in the materials, but that using a real bow will tend to
obviate these deviations, in a chorus-like effect.

Incidentally, Paul's earlier claim that flageolet tones would be sharp du=
e
to stretching the string cannot be born out. In a recording session this
year at Hessischer Rundfuk, we had great problems with the flageolets on
the cellist's G string. They sounded all wrong, so I asked the Tonmeister=

to measure them. Some were sharp, but most were too low! The cellist put =
on
a new string and everything improved to an acceptable level. I thought th=
at
the string removed must have been very old. I later asked the cellist and=

he said that, no, in fact it had been put on only the day before.
