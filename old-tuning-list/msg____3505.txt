Subject: 3rd comma meantone and the 19/oct trumpet

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

I originaly suggested this fingering, to be used with the 2nd and 3rd
harmonics (as well as their multiples).

Piccolo trumpets usually have 4 valves, to enable them to play the low G
and the notes below. What I would like to find is a soprano instrument
with 4 valves (cornet, trumpet, or fluegelhorn.)

Gary Morrison showed that we were not restricted to cutting the tubes:

The only "real" difficulty was:

Gary proposed an interesting solution:

19TET is like 3rd comma meantone, it has a just major sixth. The trumpet
is an instrument that plays notes from the harmonic serie. This interval
is found between harmonic 3 and 5. Would it be practical to use the 3rd
or 5th harmonic as the tonic? It would automaticaly give us the pure 5/3
or 6/5.
