Interesting.  I've lately been toying with a 9-out-of-31 scale.  What
religion do those numbers occur in?  Nine is significant in Norse
mythology, I think--the Norse cosmology contains Nine Worlds--but
finding a religion in which 31 is significant may be quite a task. 8-)>

Incidentally, I'm an atheist of Chinese ancestry, but I don't know that
9 or 31 are of any significance in Buddhism, Taoism, ancestor worship,
or traditional Chinese mythology/folklore.  I'll have to get some books
out tonight . . .
