Subject: asr 10 w/25 tones in just

From: Alexander Bogdanowitsch <sashabog@mail.eclipse.net>

Hello all fellow tuners:

I have a question to all ensoniq or asr 10 sampler owners.
I 've got an instrument with a 25 tone just intonation scale that I'm
trying to use to mock up this vocal quartet piece of mine, that's a free
rhythm , chordal piece. The only way I can get the notes to be remotely
similar to what's on the keyboard is breaking the scale up into 8 
different pitch tables, then copying the instrument eight times, each 
with a different pitch table chosen.
Does anyone know of any easier way to realize this? As of now, I have to
go over to the sampler and push the next button for the different section of
the tuning ,which creates an unwanted scale in the musical phrasing. There 
doesn't seem to be a way to 
switch between tunings in mid-flight. Is there a better way via midi?
I could put all the notes I need spread all amongst one 
keyboard/pitchtable, but I think it would take months for me to realize 
that way, the notes not being close to what they are on the notation.
Maybe I have to finally get a sequencer. Would that help things? 
Any ideas 
anyone? Thanks,
Sasha Bogdanowitsch
