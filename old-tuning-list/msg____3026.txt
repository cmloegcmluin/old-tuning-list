To the extent that this is tru, it certainly underscores the irrelevance of
academia to the creative process.

However, I was "turned on to", if not educated in, microtonalism through my
university composition teacher.

Even in a purely historical context, it would be nice to see a broader
understanding  of the nature and use of pre-ET in the rennaissance and
baroque.  I am amazed at how few music students are aware of the existence
of anything but ET.
