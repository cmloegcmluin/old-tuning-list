Haha, yes it involves only 6 pitches! This is amusing but
a misunderstanding. The diatonic symbol IV pretty
assuredly reflects the rational structure 4/n 5/n 6/n
where n is 3. The diatonic symbol ii is a case of 
confounded rational structures however. There are at 
least two distinct rational structures which suffer 
lossy compression in a diatonic assumption and get
lumped under "ii". You can sometimes tell by context which 
of these is being implied. The ii chord can function
in context as either the relative minor of IV, which comes 
from the rational structure n/4 n/5 n/6 where n is 5/3, 
or as the secondary v (minor) of V, which comes from the
rational structure n/4 n/5 n/6 where n is 27/16.

A diatonic piece which uses both I-(v of V)-I and
I-IV-I (no I didn't mean I-V-I) implies at least 
the 8-pitch set 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 27/20 3/2 5/3 27/16.

In vector notation, this is (using fixed-width font):

cell:

5
|
1 - 3

pitch set (C tonic):

A,- E
|   |
F - C - G - D - A
                |
                F'
