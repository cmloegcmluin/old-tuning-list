Subject: 24 tone rock

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

By the way, there was/is (I don't know what he's doing now)a guitarist 
in a heavy rock band using 24 tone eq temp a while back; his name is 
Ronnie le Tekro, and the band was called TNT. I heard a brief solo on one 
of their records, and the tonality fit the hard rock sound very well. He 
did an interview for GuitarPlayer and talked about trying to get Fender 
guitars to produce a "quarter stepper" guitar, as he called it. He also 
mentioned that some Norwegian folk music touched on quarter tones. I know 
he also did a collaboration with the great Norwegian guitarist Terje 
Rypdal, but I've never heard it...I don't think it was 
microtonal...Hstick
