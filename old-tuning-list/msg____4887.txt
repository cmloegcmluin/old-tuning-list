Subject: Sympathetic Vibrations

From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

This is a second attempt to post to the list in response to posts in 
January about sympathetic vibrations (I'm trying to catch up with a 
lot of old tuning posts):

The justly-tuned aluminum tubes of my Woodstock Gamelan will vibrate 
sympathetically whenever a pitch is soundeded at the same frequency as 
one or more of them.  This works not only when pitches are played on the 
flute or sung, but even when I cough!  Coughing gets quite a few of the
tubes to sound, and sometimes even when the cough is in a different room!
There is no sounding board on the "gamelan," so this phenomenon is 
definitely transmitted through the air directly to the tubes.

An interesting feature of sympathetic vibrations in strings or tubes is
that they lack the characteristic attack, and often have timbres closer
to sine waves than the timbres produced by "normal" playing techniques,
such as struck, plucked or bowed.
