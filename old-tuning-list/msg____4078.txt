 Gary : I thank you for your opinion on the Dynamic word. I had never heard
the word "wandering tonics" and it seems a good way to name the concept.
 (Do you know  where, when and who coined this term ?). 
 
 When I began to work in our subject I intuitively used the word Dynamic to 
speak about the changes in the frequency of the note-names in the same score.
 If the expression "Dynamic in Intonation" is used we may understand 
something different from "Dynamic in Volume". 
 Yes ! , I know the word "Dynamic" in music arrived first for change of volume
and it has its hyerarchy due to being used around the world for a long 
time. (who was the first, where and when ?)
 
 There are other names related to the same, i.e. "mutable notes", "unfixed 
scale", "by generations" that I believe I read them first in the Catgut 
Acoustical Society Magazine in the '70s, and "Extended Reference".
(((( On T.D. 898 (from last Sunday) Adam commented about "Free JI", Thanks &
fine,.., and Brian mentioned a book from the internal collection of the CNRS
titled "Acoustique Musicale," from 1959, and its first article "The dynamism
of scales and consonances in the main acoustical systems and its influence 
on the development of music" by Jacques Chailley. 
The word "dynamism" has our "Dynamic-wandering" smell or we go on semantics ?
:-)> . )))).      
 
 Excuse me, Gary, the name of the Warren Creel article was not "Dynamic in 
Music" as I said in my last e-mail (T.D 896) but "Extended Reference : An 
Unrecognized Dynamic in Melody" Paul C. Boomsliter and Warren Creel (The 
Journal of Music Theory, Spring 1963 . 7 : 1, A Yale School of Music 
Publication), and it's not the same "Dynamic in Music" (that implies also and 
historically "first" the change of volume) than "Dynamic in Melody".
 
 On 1 Dec. 1978 I read my paper on "Dynamic Gamut" in the ASA meeting held 
in Honolulu and later W. Creel sent me his article on 30 Jan. 1979.
 
 The word Dynamic comes from Greek origin and it means "Strength" or "Energy"
but in his use both in Physics as in common language implies movement. So in 
Physics there are two big chapters "Statics" and "Dynamics", both work with 
the concept of strength, the first one without movement and the other with 
movement, it deals with changes of position in time.  
 I used the expression "Gama Dinamica" for almost 30 years and for me now 
is a little hard to change. Several people here in Montevideo asked the same 
question as you and I explained to them more o less the same.
 
 Last year I published a book entitled "Principios de la Gama Dinamica" where 
I firmly established the term.
 Furthemorer, I coined the word "Dinarra" (please, read Deenarha) for a 53/oct
guitar of my invention. This word derives from DINamica and GuitARRA, it is 
"Dynamic Guitar".  
 
The first instrument was manufactured in 1977, refretted. With the second one 
I went to Hawaii 18 years ago (with my paper "Dynamic Gamut"). The chairman 
was William Savage, and Carleen Hutchins, Paul Boomsliter and Edwuard
Yadzinsky (from Buffalo Univ.) also attended as well as many other people.  
I played there "Melodia Espanola" with the Dinarra number 2.
Until now we have crafted 10 acoustic Dinarras and 1 electric one.
 
The instrument won an UNESCO prize in 1985 and was displayed for 8 months in
our Montevidean musical biggest shop "El Palacio de la Musica". 
 
 As you can see it is a little late for me to change the name of Dinarra and 
consequently the word "Dynamic" for both melody and intonation.
