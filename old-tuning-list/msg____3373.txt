Here are my answers to Scott Perman's questions.  

   Your XP-50 appears to retune by what would generally be described as setting
a number of "cents" between adjacent keys.  A cent is 1/100 of the traditional
half step, so indeed 200 cents/step would give you a wholetone scale, 50 would
give you a quartone scale, and so forth.  

   The formula for how to set your XP-50 for a "N"TET ("N" Tone-per-octave
Equal-Temperament) scale is 1200/N.  That comes from the fact that, since there
are 100 cents per half step, and 12 half-steps per octave, you get 1200 cents
per octave.  So if you want to split that octave up into 17 equal parts instead
of 12, you'll get 1200/17 = 70.6 (approx).  

   That much you appear to have figured out.  What you appear to be looking for
- how far off the resultant octaves will be - is pretty easy to figure out by
reversing that formula.  If you do 17TET for example as 70-cent steps, your
octave will have a size of 70 cents/step times 17 steps per near-octave, which
works out to 1190 cents per near-octave.  That then puts your near-octave 10
cents flat of the precise 1200-cent octave.  That's not great.  

   As for microtonal equal-temperaments to try, you correctly identified
several:  17TET, 24TET, and 31TET.  Most microtonal equal-temperament folks
agree though that the easiest equal-temperament to break into from our common
12TET heritage is 19TET.  As luck would have it, tuning 19TET as 63 cents per
step will give you a 1197-cent near-octave, which you'll probably close enough.
You can play a fairly traditional-sounding major scale in 19TET by making each
whole step span 3 19TET steps, and a half-step span 2 19TET steps.  

   Others you can try that are known to sound interesting 9TET (133 cents per
step), 7TET (171c), 22TET (54c, which unfortunately will give you a dreadfully
false octave), 34TET (35c), and 41 (29c, also a mediocre off octave).
(Curiously, 9TET and 7TET will give you that exact same 1197-cent near-octave
you'll get with a 63-cent approximation of 19TET.)

   Or if you want to try out the really strange stuff, you can try some of Wendy
Carlos' nonoctave tunings, notably "Alpha" at 78 cents per step, and "Beta" at
64 cents per step.  My current fascination is a nonoctave tuning of 88 cents per
step, which is the "88CET" tuning I keep droning on and on endlessly about.  I
don't recommend 88CET for beginners though;  I suspect you'll find it a very
difficult tuning to make sense of.  

   As for recordings to get a hold of, I definitely recommend three among many
others:
* Easley Blackwood's CD of 19 Etudes in equal-temperaments 13-24.
* If you're into popular genres, Neil Haverstick's album (cassette only left) 
  of roughly 2/3 19TET, mostly R&B guitar.
* If you're into ambientish music, Ivor Darreg's CD has a good survey of various
  equal-temperaments.  

   And finally, as for microtonal guitar work, it turns out that the guitar is
an excellent instrument for exploring unusual tunings.  Not only is it a
versatile instrument as a whole, with a (frequently anyway) easy-going aura, but
your basic playing technique alters FAR less than keyboards when you switch from
one tuning to the next.  Although Neil Haverstick is one of the most virtuosic -
possibly THE most - microtonal guitarists out there (Jon Catler is certain
exceptionally good as well), many others use guitars as well.  Ivor Darreg had
guitars fretted to ever equal-temperament from 10 to 24 if I recall correctly.
I've used them as well, and Tom Stone even ran a (barely) for-profit company
that produced interchangeable-fingerboard guitars for many hears.  Unfortunately
they are defunct now, but ... aaargh I can't remember his name ... kinda-sorta
took it over.
