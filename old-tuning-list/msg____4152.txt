OK, I'll bite (but excuse me for a moment while I take my foot out of
my mouth first :-)...

Where to begin?

My instrument of choice is bass, currently the electric bass guitar,
though I am slowly making progress on my true love, the Double Bass.
In addition to the requisite [7+5] keyboard, and pair of bongos, I
also have a couple of other instruments which I've collected over the
years, those being a hammered dulcimer and a shakuhachi.

I play none of these with any expertise, but then again I only made my
"serious" attempt to really learn music slightly less than a year ago!
Prior to that, I made several attempts, on all sorts of instruments,
but after a bit of noodling, usually became discouraged.  Finding my
"voice" in the bass was the missing element that kept me going this
time, I think.

I won't attempt to catagorize which musics I "like", as I seem to be
always finding new ones, but if I had the chops (I don't -- yet :) I
would most like to be able to play bebop and other inprovised musics
which from my perspective seem to be something of a "game" for the
musicians to enjoy as much, if not more than, the audience.  For the
time being, I do my best at holding down the bottom in a basement jam
group, where we play mostly blues based rock, the occational
"straight" blues piece, and a bit improvised "groove" music.

I've been familiar, at least in concept, with microtonal music since
college (early 80s), where I was first exposed to music by people
such as Harry Partch and Pandit Pran Nath.  From that time, until
discovering this list earlier this year, the extent of my references
were _Genesis_, _On the Sensations of Tone_, and _Lutes, Viols, and
Temperament_.  Needless to say, this list has been a gold mine!

BTW, I say "in concept" above, because it is only in the past six
months or so, thanks to acquiring a tuneable synth, that I've actually
been able to touch, hear, noodle, taste and experience it, beyond the
few recordings I have, or the odd experiments I've subjected some of my
instruments to at one time or another.

There probably isn't much I can offer into the dialog here for the
moment, given my beginner status, but I hope that by "beginning" with
more than one tuning, I can somehow carry a bit of what I learn here,
not only into "my" music, but to some other folks who don't really
have the inclination to get into all the technical stuff, but just 
want to play.  [I know if we had the instruments, we'd probably be
attempting to cover at least one of Neil's 19TET pieces.]

Hope this wasn't too long...

I am glad to be in your company,

Steve
