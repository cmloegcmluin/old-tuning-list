There are many dedicated microtonal flutists throughout the world.  Robert
Dick plays unsystemitized microtones, neither just nor equal.

Andrew Bolotowsky of the AFMM Ensemble has played in a myriad of tunings
on flute (AFMM flutist).  Stefani Starin plays dead on JI flute with
Newband, which she co-directs.  John Fonville, Ann LeBerge, Bruce Gremo,
Pierre Yves Artaud, and others with whom I am as yet unfamiliar.

Three are numerous fingering charts for flute since the mid-eighteenth
century.  Howell's early flute work featured a 31-TET fingering chart in
1974 (The Avant-Garde Flute, University of California Press).

There was a tough period when Bartolozzi's _New Sounds For Woodwinds_
printed quartertone fingerings for flute that didn't work.  Toru Takemitsu
was really burned by this when he wrote _Voice_ and other flute works
utilizing Bartolozzi's fingerings.

Open hole flute or closed hole flute?  No contest, Robert Dick has the
only open hole bass flute - I believe - in the world.  (He had it made.)
Robert is now living in Zurich, Switzerland.  He has a private press
called Mutliple Breath.  I learned to circular breathe using his book for
circular breathing on the flute.  Couldn't have done it without him.  Very
straight forward.  He says his style of microtonal composition stems from
his years as a Yale composition student working primarily with tape music,
cutting and splicing.
