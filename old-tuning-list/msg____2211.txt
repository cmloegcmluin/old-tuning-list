Subject: E-mu sysex tuning tables?

From: pfly@nyx10.cs.du.edu (juxlus)

Hello all, I am relatively new to this forum and want to express my thanks
to the people who post their interesting and useful research in alternate
tunings here.  I have learned a great deal so far and am interesting in
exploring many of the scales discussed here.  I have a E-mu Morpheus and have
been exploring the 19-tone scale that it comes with pre-defined.  Unless I
am mistaken, customizing the user definable tuning table is not too
trivial (in terms of time requirement).  The manual says the steps of 
fine tuning are "approximately 1.56 cents", so I take it one has to a bit 
of figuring for each MIDI note.

I'm wondering if there are archives of E-mu sysex tuning tables available
and/or any utilities that would construct the sysex tuning table from a
formula.  I am under the impression that the tuning tables are "standard"
among all current E-mu synths.  Working "by hand" is fine, but slow.

Thanks for any help, and thanks for such a great forum!
