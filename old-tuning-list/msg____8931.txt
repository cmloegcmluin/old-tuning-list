Sorry about the bandwidth people but if you've got a good spatial
imagination then I encourage examining the sets of three diagrams -- it
can be quite enlightening to get a 3-d understanding of a scale in your
head.

I don't know -- I can give you the coordinates of the notes and you can
do the rest -- let me know off the list. A molecular modeling tool might
be the best kind of software for this -- I would use bonds to represent
consonant intervals.
