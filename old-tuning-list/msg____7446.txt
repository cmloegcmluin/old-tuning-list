Check my Microtonal Synthesis web site at http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink to
answer these types of questions.  I don't have personal experience with
either unit, but generally Korg equipment is limited to 12 note scales with
+-50 cents range per note, while Roland equipment is limited to 12 note
scales wtih +-63 cents range per note.
