Well . . . yeah, in many ways.  They both have the same number of
pitches and the identical interval content.  If you were doing a
Forte-style set analysis, you damn betcha they'd be considered the same.
Of course major and minor triads aren't _identical_, but when we're
talking about scale resources, I'd say that the difference between 2)5
and 3)5 dekanies (on the same set of factors) aren't even in the same
ballpark as the differences between either one and a 2)6 pentadekany (is
that the right term?) or a 3)6 eikosany.  I wasn't trying to imply
anything more than that.
