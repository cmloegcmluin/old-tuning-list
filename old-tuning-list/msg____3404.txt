You know, I remember occasionally reading something here
(usually uttered in Brian's defense after a particularly
bilious attack) that things might be different if we only
*knew* him instead of the occasionally redlining rant
generator who posts under his name from the splended
isolation of the Oregonian leftcoast.

In a similar vein, one must suppose that things are
exceptionally bad when one sees the estimable Mr.
Lyon rise to Mr. Cage's defense. Having met and actually
hobnobbed some with Eric, I can guarantee that seeing
him resolutely defending John against the McLarenist
screed would bring a smile to your face. It amuses the
heck outta me....

Hey, wait a minute - come to think of it, *I* don't
even like Cage all that much, myself. And, come to think of
it, have I programmed Cage on my "pimping for High
Modernism*" radio program more than Eric's patented
electroacoustic rollercoaster rides through the darkness?
[pause to fire up web browser]. Nope. They're even over
the course of the last programming year. Wait! I'm actually
playing the noncanonical Partch recordings, too. Whoops!

With regards,
Gregory
