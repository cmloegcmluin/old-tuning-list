Microtones are present in all the intervals made by free-intonation
instrumentalists.
When I was 12 I heard different records of the same piece played by the
greats violinists of my time. I didn't understand why the music academy
taught 12 tones per Octave and many more were heard. The notes were of
different frequencies but nobody answered this dicotomie.
This was the start point of my studies on tuning.
During their life, all the violinists use the "tonal material" in a
different form.
Twenty years ago In an ASA joint meeting I spoke to Carleen Hutchins about
Ruggiero Ricci and she affirmed what I was telling her, it is that RR was
the person who changed more the notes-frequencies in the same piece.
I didn't know if she knew this by ear or according to a rigourous work.

I ask to the forum, does anybody know about some publication on this topic ?
