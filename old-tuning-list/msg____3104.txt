Subject: a purportedly "serious error"
--
John Chalmers posted the following in Tuning Digest 718:
"I want to correct a serious error in one of Brian McLaren's recent
posts. While not a peer-reviewed journal, XENHARMONIKON welcomes
contributions from academics." -- John Chalmers
John's "correction" of my purportedly "serious error" is itself 
in error.
The statement which John characterized as a "serious error" was:
"...Xenhamonikon is published and vetted completely outside
academia." -- mclaren, Tuning Digest 717
This statement is true as it stands.
The journal Xenharmonikon is not published under the auspices under
any academic institution.  No faculty peer review committee scrutinizes
the papers submitted to Xenharmonikon.  John Chalmers does not
have an appointment in the music department of any university.
Whatever Xenharmonikon's origins, it is not now  affiliated with 
any institution of higher education.
All of these facts remain facts.  Therefore John Chalmers was
incorrect when he claims that my above statement is a
"serious error."  I will repeat my factual statement for the
record: Xenharmonikon is published and vetted entirely outside
academia.
Please do not take this to mean that Xenharmonikon is any
less scrupulous in checking its facts than a so-called "serious"
new music journal.  In my experience, John Chalmers does a
superb job of fact-checking.  On occasion Your Humble E-Mail
Correspondent helps out.
Moreover, Xenharmonikon is more interesting IMHO than the
so-called "serious" new music journals (many of which cannot
be taken seriously) because Xenharmonikon accepts articles
on areas of tuning theory and microtonality which are truly
adventurous and imaginative.
John *is* correct  in pointing out that academics often publish
articles in Xenharmonikon, primarily because the 12-TET-obsessed
"new music journals" have traditionally seldom accepted articles
which venture outside the Sacred Twelve Tones.
Bear in mind that I never said that Xenharmonikon doesn't publish
articles by people in academia.  What I said was that Xenharmonikon
is not published under the auspices of any university and does not
have a faculty peer review committee to vet submissions, and both
of these statements remain factually correct.
However, with Musical Quarterly and 20th Century Music and 
Perspectives of New Music having recently printed articles about
non-12 music, this "12-TET only" policy in the so-called "serious"
new music journals might be breaking down.
Only time will tell.
