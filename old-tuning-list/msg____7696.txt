Remember, Li and Yorke's "Period Three Implies Chaos" results, like those 
of Feigenbaum, only apply to unimodal maps of the interval. The "Feigenbaum 
constant" is not the same for all systems, and there are maps and ODEs that 
period triple from simple behavior. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, one 
of my students found a period tripling sequence in a physical parametrically 
driven pendulum.
