That concert was indeed very memorable if only for the incredible volume
and intensity of the sound produced by the sorna.
This CD is "The music of Lorestan, Iran", Shahmirza Moradi & Reza Moradi.
Nimbus Records, 1994, NI 5397, t.t. 77'44''.
Tracks: 1. Sangin Se-pa^ 2. Se-pa^ 3. Do-pa^ 4. 'Asha^yeri 
5. Sha^ne-Shaki 6. Sava^r-Ba^zi
If you play it at the actual volume, the neighbours may not like it!
