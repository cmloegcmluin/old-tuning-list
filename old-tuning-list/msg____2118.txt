In 5th century AD, a Chinese scholar found a string 9 feet long will not
arrive at an octave of it multiple, but instead 8.88 feet. So he divide
the error equally among the twelve fifths.

In 1584, another Chinese scholar calculated the division of the octave
with the RMS values and got the exact et scale to 25 decimal places.

My reference is in Chinese, therefore no English translations here.
