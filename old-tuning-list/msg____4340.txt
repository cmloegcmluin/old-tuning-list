Subject: kick ass chops explained better

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Not long after I joined the list, edging up on three years ago (wow,
congrats to Dave Mandole!), I made an assertion that I still believe, and
perhaps even more so now than before:  Microtonal musicians have to be
musical supermen (or women of course).  

   Not only do we have to write, perform, and interpret our music, but we
also have to explore entirely new realms and come up with ingeneous
theories.  But even more challenging is that we need to do all of this in a
way that convinces skeptical audiences that it's exciting.  

   That's a tall order that needs a whole lot of work to fill.
