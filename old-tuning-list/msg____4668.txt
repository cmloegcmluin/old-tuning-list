Comments to Manuel Op de Coul    coul@ezh.n  about Arabic Tuning

I've been playing with a group here in Toronto that performs Arabic and Greek
music. Two of the group went to Syria to study for 3 months last year. They
also came back with a qanuun that has quarter tone levers, which I understand
to is common to even student models. I hear you can also get 9 comma models,
though I don't how that is based, ie what comma or how many steps to an
octave. However the quarter tone model is usually based on 12 tet tuning
(open strings) but is functionally 24 tet.
Another friend has been in Turkey for the last 2 years studying they're
classical music, she's comming back in a couple of weeks so I'll quiz her
more about current tunings.
