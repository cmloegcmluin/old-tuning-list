Subject: Re: Dave Hill's Wolf sonority

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

A week or two ago I described my experience with the Hill/Ellis JI
keyboard tuning when used for Pachelbel's Canon in D. I noted two places
where there was a striking "out-of-tune" sensation: the E over the
B-minor chord, and the B over the A-major chord. Note that there is one
other place where the "wolf" B-E occurs in the piece: the E over the
G-major chord. However, this didn't strike me as that dissonant, so I
left it out, though I was aware that it contained the wolf. This G-B-D-E
sonority is almost identical to the one that Margo and Dave have been
discussing, making me wish I had pointed it out earlier instead of just
implying it by omission from the list of horrible clashes in the JI
version of the piece. Anyway, I'm just registering my agreement that the
sonority is not that horrible and has a certain character that could be
musically useful.
