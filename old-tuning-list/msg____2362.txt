Subject: RE: more Bach

From: reinhard@styx.ios.com (Johnny Reinhard)

Where is the microtonal Beethoven? is a common enough complaint. Here was a
man's who's music improved as he went deaf.  

Why not accept that for J.S. Bach, writing in a full cycle of 12 major and
minor keys _was_ "microtonal."  Despite the fact that there was no concept
of "absolute pitch," he mastered improvisation regardless of intonation.  He
often showed off on keyboards that were limited by meantone tuning,
emphasizing the howling of the wolves (old Silbermann story).

That Bach springs divine is a tribute to him and not to any subtle variation
of key characteristics...certain. But there is no clear connection between
this success story and those of us challenging ourselves creatively with a
tabula rasa, daily.

Living and breathing music as Bach, Beethoven, et al. did allowed for a
mastery of craft that resonates with greatness.  It came with no guarantees.
There were many others that tried and didn't pass muster.

Bach's special qualities that I can hear distincltly brought to bear in his
music when tuned in Werckmeister III - is my preference.  To understand as
completely as possible why I like it so, I have spent some academic time and
earned some academic dues.  But they 'ain't nothing compared to playing the
music.  It's like the difference between reading a printout and being
plugged directly into cyberspace with all its functions available.

BTW, those in the NYC metropolitan area, please feel invited to tune in to
the 8th annual "Microtonal" Bach radio show which I host on WKCR-FM, 89.9 FM
on Christmas Day, December 25th from 11 AM to 3 PM.  It is part of an annual
week-long BachFest.
