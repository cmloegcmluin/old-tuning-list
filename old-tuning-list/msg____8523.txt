Subject: Re: Neutral Third

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Neutral thirds are often credited to Zalzal, a midieval 'oud player named
Zalzal that introudced the lute (l'oud) to Southern Europe).  Now, the
'oud (which means "wood" in Arabic) goes through phases every 200 years or
so between fretted and unfretted fingerboards.

Zalzal had frets and he placed a fret between major and minor, as well as
between their corresponding sixths (major and minor).  Modern Egyptian
music still uses these intervals, as well as others implied by them.

I first noticed the neutral third in the General Motors Word's Fair car
horn: D F+ A F+

One special characteristic of the neutral third is that no matter what
kind of 5th there is in a system, the neutral third is always in the same
place logarithmically.  

My experience with it really began with a piece I composed called "Neo"
which has a be-bop-like quartertone romp set off by the previously
mentioned car horn motive,

Perhaps familiarity with the interval eases it into its own niche wherein
it is neither major nor minor.  It simply is.
