Subject: My good deed for the week

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@InterLinx.qc.ca>

In Sherbrooke, where I live, the top gun in music is Gilles Dion, retired music teacher at the 
university. A month or two ago, when I presented him with an article I wrote about 53TET, he was not interested 
and did not even bother reading it. But...

	On our way to a Thanksgiving gig in NH, I had him listen to Gary Morisson's 88CET demo tape.  Being a 
jazz trombone player, he could appreciate the sound of the subminor thirds in the dominant seventh chord. 
That's when it clicked.  He was surprised of hearing all these xenharmonic chord progressions, that were very 
different from the regular ones, yet everything made sense. He found it refreshing and was happy to see that a 
young musician like me was searching for the perfect pitch. He asked if he could copy the tape and offered me 
private lessons, which is an honor for me, because he doesn't normally teach anymore.

	I believe that any serious musician, if well oriented on the subject of microtonality, will be 
interested in knowing more about other tunings.
