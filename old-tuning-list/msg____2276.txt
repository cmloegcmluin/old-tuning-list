Subject: 17 Lyrics of Li Po

From: tmook@interramp.com (Ted Mook)

Hello all:

This shameless bit of self-promotion will be concluded by a question, so if
any of you can help, it would be very much appreciated:

RELEASE OF HARRY PARTCH'S 17 LYRICS OF LI PO
Tzadik 7012

Stephen Kalm, intoning voice
Ted Mook, tenor violin

The record should be arriving in stores as you read this!!!but, since its
not exactly top 40, the truck might not stop at your home record store...

If you try and fail, you may email me for direct purchase info.

My question:

Tzadik has a very limited promotional effort underway, which I would like
to augment with some focused mailing to some sympathetic radio stations and
responsible, well-rounded critics with a sense of perspective (few though
they may be). If any of you tuners have suggestions in the form of a name
and some kind of address, would you be kind enough to email me with the
information? As some of you know, I am a moving target, on tour since t=0
and remaining so for the next generation, so email is practically the only
way to hit me. But, you could leave a message on my service, if there is no
other way. (212) 866-1889, but I will hate you in the morning.

Thanks, and all the best.

PS> when you hear it, go gentle: I did the best I could....you guys are as
mean as snakes.
