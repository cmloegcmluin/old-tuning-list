Subject: Tuners

From: "Kami Rousseau" <kami@InterLinx.qc.ca>

Giardinelli sent me their 1997 catalog and I immediatly looked at the
tuners section. The Korg MT1200 is still there.
"This state-of-the-art tuning device is the most advanced in Korg's popular
series of sophisticated tuners. In addition to basic tuning operations, its
features include tuning presets for microtonal music, user programmable
temperaments and a convenient instrument mode. Now you can precisely tune
any musical instrument, including all keyboard, stringed and brass
instruments. Its easy-to-read meters display calibration values in up to
four digits by the LEDs, as well as the octave positions and pitch names.

Retail $375.00
No.064586 $277.75"

There is also the Strobe Center 5000 from Peterson, but it costs 2927$US.
