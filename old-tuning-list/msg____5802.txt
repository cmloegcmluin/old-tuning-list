Subject: classical meantone - the horn

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I spoke with Douglas Leedy, who is also a hornist, and he explained that
handhorn technique traditionally used different hand positions in the bell
for sharps and flats. I went on to look at Groves and was surprised to see
just such a table of positions from the 19th century, and the implicationis clearly more in the meantone than in the ET/well direction, with sharps
lower than flats.

Inasmuch as the classical orchestra was an orchestra without continuo
instruments, and chamber music with keyboard is exceptional for both Haydn
and Mozart (though not for Beethoven), we find major genres without
instruments in any fixed temperament. For these reasons alone, it's
probably worthwhile re-examining the intonational assumptions about how
this music was performed. While I will not go so far as Vogel and proposeJust Intonations for works by these composers, I think the fact that the
tonal vocabulary for most works of Haydn or Mozart does not extend beyondthe resources of Meantone - and limits intonationally ''exotic'' chords to
the development sections, is highly suggestive. (I could also state this
fact in a different way: Haydn and Mozart avoided keys that would have been
acceptable in a well temperament). If we add the fact that certain
instruments (organs, horns) were known to have been tuned or played in
meantone, the case for the acceptance of meantone in the late 18th century
becomes even stronger.  Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
