       From what I have experienced and learned, virtually all of the Well
Temperaments have the property of ascending dissonance in the tonic thirds as
the key signature gains more accidentals.  At the same time, since thirds and
fifths are in acoustical oppostion,  the keys with the most purely tuned
thirds have the most highly tempered fifths.  This supported the twin
capabilities of some keys favoring the harmony, while others, ( the remote
keys), provided more "expression" for the melodic line.  
Also, to the above quote, Joseph  Downing replies:

      This is not quite right, (IMHO), .  The Valotti temperament, following
the style of the Italians, does tune the F-A third as the purest third in the
temperament.  However,  if we look at a number of other well temperaments,
such as the Prinz, Young, D'Alembert, or G.F.Handel,   we find the C-E third
is the purest, (not always just, but usually very close). 
   Since the  common denominator seems to be that additiional accidentals
bring  about about increases in the tempering of the root tonic thirds, how a
temperament allotted the comma was a lively topic of conversation in the 18th
century. Some, like the Young, begin with a slightly tempered C-E, and
progress in even steps all the way up to F#-A# and Gb-Bb.  This is a
beautiful temperament in its symmetry,plus the fact that the most highly
tempered thirds are exactly 1 syntonic comma wide.  This is the idealized
well temp. form,  according to Jorgensen. 
      There are several temperaments by Stanhope that favor the C-E and G-B
equally, and  others, (Rousseau),  that favor the F-A and C-E as the closest
to pure polar keys,  so it seems that the C-E was the pivot point around
which the maximum purity was normally placed.  This makes sense as a legacy
of the meantone systems, as the most common meantone  systems are, I think,
directly aimed at producing the Just C-E first.  (A real meantone maven could
help us out here,  I tread thinner ice when I get to far before
Werckmiester). 
      
      Even though the Prinz is probably my favorite,  the Young is the most
succesful temperament for initiating the heretofore unexposed12 tet masses
into key color recognition.  I find that some musicians are most impressed
with the added purity in the simpler keys, and others are struck by the edge
and brilliance that comes from the more highly tempered keys.  Some can't
tell the differerence, and others go nuts! A well known piano entertainer, (
he was entertainer of the year in the Country music world once before.......)
went for my explanation on the temperaments, and I tuned a very clean Young
on his Steinway.   He called his studio tuner the next day to come return it
to ET.  He couldn't stand it!!.  This is an easily acquired taste, but it is
an acquired one..
