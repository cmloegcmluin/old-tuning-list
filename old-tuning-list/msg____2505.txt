Jos Kunst
                   3-1-1936       1-1996

An advertisement in today's newspaper announced the sudden
and premature death of composer and musicologist Jos Kunst.
He started studying music at the age of 27 after having studied
French. He was a pupil of Joep Straesser and Ton de Leeuw.
In 1976 he graduated from the Amsterdam Conservatory. He taught 
history of music of the 20th century in Utrecht. In 1978 he obtained
a doctor's degree with the thesis "Making sense in music".
He wrote electronic music, refined chamber- and orchestral works, and 
made use of microtonality. He received several prizes for his music,
among which for "Insecten" (1967), and "Arboreal" (1969).
His surname is an appropriate one: kunst means art.
