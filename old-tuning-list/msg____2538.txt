Subject: Justonics JI synths

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

Last weekend Brian McLaren and I visited Erv Wilson in LA and he
showed us some literature about synths, sound cards and
software from  Justonic Tuning Inc (#103, 1650 Alberni Street,
Vancouver, B.C. V6G 1A6, Canada; (604) 682.-3456) and
Virtual DSP Corp, 4119 125th St. SE. Everett, WA 98208;
(206) 338- 0985. They are committed to JI and have written
software which automatically generates just harmonies over
roots controllable by the player.
	Their literature quotes Scot Wilkinson, Harry Parch (sic),
Lou Harrison., Ben Johnson (sic), even me, among others. The
sheet "A Brief History of Tone," alas, is full of errors, but
in general, they seem to hahone their homework.
	 Does anybody know anything about these companies and their 
products?
