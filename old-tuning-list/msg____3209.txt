Hello,
       I introduced myself to the Net about a year and a half ago.
At that time I was experimenting with my own non-octal tunings, and
now I feel ready to make use of them, and to share them with the
likes of you with the hope that you may be interested enough to
hear them.
      
       Basically I have neglected the octave (or diapason I should
say) in favour of what I have christened the 'Sicktave'. This is
the interval of 1300 cents.  I began to divide the Sicktave into
5ET, then 6ET, and so on.  So far I have merely been recording
improvisations in each of these scales, but I should eventually like 
to compose for sickly tuned instruments.

     If anyone is interested, I should like to exchange midi-files 
or tapes, particularly with non-octal composers (as I find octaves 
quite repulsive).

       Thanks. Hope to read you soon...
