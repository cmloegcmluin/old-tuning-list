Subject: Acoustics of Cyberspace Lecture NYC 11/18/96

From: jmax@interport.net (John Maxwell Hobbs)

I would like to invite you to my lecture:

ACOUSTICS OF CYBERSPACE
Parsons School of Design
Monday November 18th, at 6:30pm
25 E. 13th Street, NYC  Room 206.

The lecture is free.
There will be a RECEPTION to follow.


The lecture will focus on the "Virtual Abbey" project I developed with
David Hykes a year ago.  With the help of Michel Redolphi and Luc Martinez
at CIRM in Nice, we transported the acoustic environment of le Thoronet
Abbey, a 12th century abbey in the south of France, to The Kitchen in New
York City.  The voices of the Harmonic Choir were digitally transmitted to
the abbey, the reverberation of the abbey was then transmitted back to New
York in real time, where the audience had the same acoustical experience as
those who were in the real abbey in France.

I will also discuss the potential for this kind of acoustical tranportation
in the 21st century.

Please join me -- we will have a small reception afterward.
