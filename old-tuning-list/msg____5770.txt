re: Wolf posting -  In Praise of Meantone.
 
Daniel Wolf's observations on the arrival of horological accuracy, 
and the declining use of meantones tunings, with moves towards
well temperaments and eventually in favor of 12tET, 
does have a certain irony.
(see end of post *)
 
Assuming that he is correct (I have no reason to doubt him on this), 
and the fashion moved from meantone into well temperaments, and 
eventually 12tET, I wonder why meantone tunings were abandoned.
 
Could it have been due to the limitations imposed on composers and 
performers, when using twelve fixed pitches per octave?
 
The difficulty of quickly retuning meantones would have severely
restricted the harmonic possibilities, yet well temperaments 
immediately offered keyboard players both tuning and intervallic 
novelties, in different keys.
 
So the musical innovators of the time gravitated towards
well temperaments or to providing more notes per octave with
instrument developments, resulting in 19tET, 31tET, 53tET etc.
 
Could 12tET's ubiquity be blamed on the need to simplify the 
well-tempered subtleties for subsequent less tonally sophisticated 
generations?
 
Meanwhile the JI advocates were still plugging away with an obsolete
system, which had already been thrashed to death by earlier generations,
and have regularly temporarily resuscitated it for later generations,
as historical curiosities.
 
I appreciate that there is a strong bias against meantones tunings,
by many tuning list subscribers, who still praise, rank, map, and compare 
their JI and ET tunings to "beatless perfection".
 
I seem to be seeing/hearing a revival of interest in meantones since
their possibilities now made available by recent technological 
developments.
 
Despite their unfortunately ugly name, "meantone tunings" to my
biased mind have many redeeming characteristics which can now be 
used practically.
 
 
1) Modulation and transposition is easy and limitless.
2) The tunings are clearly and easily defined by:
 a) size of Large interval (or difference between 
    Fourth (IVth) and Fifth (Vth) interval) plus
 b) Octave Ratio.
3) All spiral and most circular tunings can also be described in
   these terms. Eg. Pythagorean, and almost all ET systems.
4) Harmonic and intervallic relationships are clear.
5) Scales can easily be unambiguously coded.
6) Degrees (or levels) of consonance and dissonance are obvious.
7) Current technology allows rapid retuning with conventional
   fingering.
8) All intervals can be described in terms of Large (L) and
   small (s) intervals to know precision.
 
9) The notation system is conventional and well-established.
 
BTW Has anyone else looked carefully at Bill and Anne Collins
Collinsian Concepts notation system (May 1995)?
 
So maybe it's time to take a second and deeper look at the 
"neglected" meantone potentials.
