Subject: Partch videos, films, recordings?

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Does anyone have any information on the availability of films, 
videos,  or new recordings (or releases) of Harry Partch's "Oedipus" and 
"Revelation in the Courthouse Park"? I have the old Gate Five recordings, 
most CRI releases and have seen some of the films in University of 
Illinois film archive, but I don't have up-to-date announcements and
catalogs from CRI, the U of Illinois, and the other vendors with me 
in CA, except Phil Blackburn's and the Harry Partch Archives/ enclosures
series. 
	I think others  on the Tuning List would appreciate information 
on obtaining all of the available Partch recordings and videos, so 
perhaps anyone with information  would like to post to the List, though 
email to me is fine.
