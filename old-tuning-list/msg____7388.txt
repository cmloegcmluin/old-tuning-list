Subject: Steel Blue?

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Looking over the web pages for one of my favorite bands, Gong, I found
the following:

"In 1989, Rowe formed Steel Blue with guitarist Jon Catler, a graduate
of Berklee School of Music and the leading innovator in microtonal music
for the guitar. In this project, both Rowe and Jon use customized
guitars equipped with interchangeable fingerboards, allowing them to
switch tuning systems in seconds. This process is called 'Just
Intonation', based on the natural harmonic series of undertones and
overtones up to a 13-limit. Steel Blue started out with a line-up of
Jon, Hanny, Beno=EEt Moerlen (customised vibes) and Fran=E7ois Causse
(drums), but the eponymous album recorded in 1991 (and released on LoLo
Records in 1993) featured Catler and Rowe with Jose Joaquin Garcia
(vocals) and Lionel Cordew (drums), playing straight rock music."

Any info on this album?
