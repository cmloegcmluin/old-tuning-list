This isn't what you asked for, but you might be interested in the
following message (forwarded from HPSCHD-L, which is currently in an
uproar over the idea of applying now for a patent on something that
people have been doing for hundreds of years).  There may be a job
waiting for you at Yamaha, unless the harpsichord contingent sues their
asses off. 8-)>

Subject: New (?) from Yamaha

The June 1998 issue of the Journal of the Audio Engineering Scoiety
describes a patent (5,516,981, assigned to Yamaha):

"Musical Instrument Tuned in Nineteen Note Temperament Scale

This patent assumes that some of the musical chords using the 12-tone
equally tempered scale are not sufficiently consonant from the
standpoint of minimizing beats.  Equally tempered scales are examined
that have a larger number (19 or 31) of notes. It is concluded that 19
notes per octave provides musical intervals having a smaller number of
beats while still being manageable for the playing musician.  Examples
are given for keyboard, brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments."

Ther is an illustration of a keyboard layout similar to that of a
chromatic harpsichord.

Should we consider as a list bringing a class action suit? :-)
