And I, like a complete twonk, completely mis-read what he'd said.
For some unknown reason I thought he was saying that more 'partials'
would eat into available sample RAM, rather than system/program RAM
(or ROM?).  This puts into question the positive rating of my IQ and
my ability to read plain English.  So I'm very sorry for the
redundant explanations  in the last digest.  And John, contrary to
what I said, wasn't remotely wrong.

John's reasoning is:  to greatly extend the number of
'partials'/zones available would take up too much system memory,
causing the cost of the unit to increase too much.  That seems
suprising - but it may be true (?)

Except that, as I understand, the E4 does not have this architectural
feature (ie., more 'partials' do eat into sample RAM, they certainly
did on the EIII).   The drawbacks on the E4 are rather : cost, tuning
resolution, speed of setting up the zones/samples for ATS.

Apologies again for my inability to read..........
