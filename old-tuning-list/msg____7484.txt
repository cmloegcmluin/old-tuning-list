Monzo:
Schoenberg continually speaks of "problems" in connection
with learning the craft of composition and also in connection
with the act of composing itself.  After spending years trying
to divine as much as possible what Schoenberg had in mind
as regards chromaticism, intonation, ratios, 12-eq, and
pantonality (his term for what most of us know as
his "free atonality" period), I have come to the conclusion
that what Schoenberg meant in referring to "problems"
is that given the acceptance of the 12-eq scale as a
compositional medium, there are _many_ different ratios
(both higher-prime "overtone" relationships in vertical 
sonorities as well as traditional 3- and 5-limit relationships
in melodic movement) that can be represented
by each 12-eq pitch-class, and the composer's task
is to understand what those rational relationships sound
like (and also to understand their psychological and
emotional effects) and how to represent those sounds
(and feelings) by notes available in the 12-eq scale.

The relevant passage is quoted below:

Monzo:
I will continue the quote from this spot because it is
pertinent to the discussion we've been having of Schoenberg
[p. 25 and 26]:

Monzo:

(Many people have noted the similarities between
Schoenberg and Partch -- if I didn't know better, I'd
be ready to swear that Partch must have read this
passage and used it as the catalyst for his life's work.)

Schoenberg _clearly_ realized that composers (and
performers) would eventually tackle the problems
of using more complex scale resources.  It is obvious
that he knew that music would keep evolving, in
ways which could not even be imagined at the time
he wrote this.

I wondered in my last posting why Schoenberg placed
so much importance on numbers but manipulated them
as 12-eq pitch-classes rather than as ratios.  That last
phrase about "unexplored territory" is probably the
key: the 12-eq scale _in relation to its supposed
representation of ratios_ is indeed "not so well defined"
by Schoenberg, and apparently, purposely left so, in
order to leave room to explore those "mystical
connections".

Monzo:
Simply that Schoenberg (as well as Oettingen, Riemann, et al.)
was using the _acoustical_ phenomenon of the overtone series
as a basis for explanation, while Partch denied this single
acoustical archetype as a basis for harmony, and emphasized
instead the properties inherent in _numerical_ comparisons.

Monzo:

In particular, I found Daniel Wolf's quoting of Schoenberg's
letter to Yasser to be invaluable.  I've never seen it before,
and it clearly explains Schoenberg's position regarding
the 12-eq scale and its rational implications.
