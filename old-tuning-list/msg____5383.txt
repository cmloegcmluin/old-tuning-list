   That's a perfectly valid question, but on my opinion, it's based upon a
partly valid and partly faulty premise.  That premise is that the only goal
in tuning pitches is to get as close as possible to just intonation.  JI is
a fine goal, and there's certainly not a thing wrong with that pursuit.  I
personally find octave-repeating harmonic-series-fragment tunings very
interesting when it comes to JI.

   But it's not the only meaningful tuning goal.  Equal temperaments, or
other nonjust tunings, can be interesting for two main reasons:
1.  The approximations of basic JI intervals also sound interesting in their
    own right.
2.  These tunings provide a new, nontraditional compositional paradigm.  For
    example, I'm now working in 88CET, a tuning that doesn't represent the
    octave at all, and which has 8 instead of 7 steps per perfect fifth.  Lemme
    tellya, that'll make you step back and rethink music entirely differently!
