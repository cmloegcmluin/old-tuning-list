When I said he wouldn't have a problem, I meant in theory he would probably
have had nothing against it.  I did not mean that he actually did modulate
the entire diamond.

I know it.

That is a fantastic story!  I have enough love for stories about Partch or
Wilson, let alone a story involving them both!

Hmm.  Interestin'

Most certainly it is.  "Tonal flux" is a type of modulation in my book.

I am very impressed by your knowledge of Partch's work.  Are you familiar
with _Dreamer_ or _Delusion of the Fury_?
