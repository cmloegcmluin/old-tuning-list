Subject: relativity and understanding and Sagan

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Interesting discussions on physics, etc. First of all, is it at all 
possible that science will reach areas where it is impossible to explain 
certain phenomenon in terms we can comprehend? Is it conceiveable that a 
more intuitive, "mystical" way of approaching the Universe will be what 
we are confronted with? There's that old saw, "the Universe is not only 
stranger than we can imagine; it'e stranger than we CAN imagine" (or 
something like that). Meaning, there are places where our intellectual 
minds cannot ever comprehend the happenings. I believe that is quite 
possible, but that is not frightening to me...it seems quite reasonable.
Humans occupy a special place in the cosmos, but that doesn't mean we're 
able to reduce all things to our sphere of understanding. In fact, if one 
cares to explore other cultures, they often find "mystical" (sorry) ideas 
and concepts, and folks doing things that defy any sort of "scientific" 
understanding.
And that brings me to my reply to Paul Hahn about Sagan's death. In 
Paul's original message (which I did not save), there seemed to be a sort 
of condescension present, in the form of Sagan, which seemed to say, 
"there, there, don't take that mystical crap too seriously;" in fact, I 
do know Sagan represented a philosophy which I find ludicrous, namely 
that there is no ultimate Creator, and those who believe so are a little, 
shall we say, "old fashioned", or something to that effect. That's why I 
mentioned his death; what could be more mystical, final, and absolutely 
out of our control?
All of this relates to music, to me...I cannot separate music from any 
other facet of life, including what we call "science." But, science just 
shows, in mathematical or other terms, what is there in a fashion that 
may or may not explain what's REALLY happening. Even one of the greatest 
scientists of all time, Newton, was well aware of the limits of science, 
and spent much time exploring other, more important, facets of what makes 
the Universe tick. I myself have experienced many phenomena which are 
well beyond the capacity of any "scientific" explanationm, and which, 
unfortunately, many folks who consider science the be all and end all, 
would probably not believe in, anyway. And my own experiences, personal 
though they may be, are quite valid and illuminating as to the fact that 
there are greater realities out there, which what we call the scientific 
method would be quite helpless at explaining, or understanding....Hstick
