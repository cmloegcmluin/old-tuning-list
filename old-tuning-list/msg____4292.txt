Subject: tuning a Roland

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

If I recall, back in the "Which synths should I buy?" thread, the consensus
was to boycott Roland, who never allow microtuning and never will.  Whoever
said this aparrently did not do their homework, since I have found a Roland
Super JD module (if anyone is interested, write me and I'll go back to the
studio to check the model number) which allows any "part"--that's "voice"
to most of us--to be tuned in increments of +/- 64ths of a tempered
semitone.  This is in the form of an octave=repeating pitch-class tuning
table.  Also, some of their patches seems to have a background layer tuned
in quarter-tones (like their "telephone" sound-effect), so I'll bet that
extended scales can be done--I just don't know how.

It's not ideal, but is a great boon for people who like Roland sounds,
which are much slicker than those found on the Proteus.

Another methond of microtuning synths that has not been mentioned is to
build a scale note-by-note as a "drum kit."  I know that some Yamahas allow
both coarse and fine detuning on a note-by-note basis in their "drum kits,"
and perhaps other brands will permit this as well.
