No, I understood you perfectly.  The MIDI Tuning Standard has a maximum
resolution of 100 cents / 2^14 = .0061 cents.  Only 768TET, 1536 TET,
3072TET, etc. fit within that standard.  Trying to achieve some other nTET
with better consistency will have several problems from a practical
standpoint:
1. The MIDI Tuning Standard, while currently implemented by only three
manufacturers (Emu, Ensoniq and Turtle Beach), is the only standard we've
got.  To propose some division of the semitone other than its 2^n divisions
would set back the little progress it has made.  I know some list members
are disappointed over the lack of response to the MIDI Tuning Standard, but
this is to be expected given the design life cycles of these instrument
lines that amount to 3-8 years on average.
2.  Division of the octave or semitone by other than binary multiples is
not likely to be accepted by manufacturers.  They have no margin timewise
for anything more complicated than binary multiplication/division in
calculating pitch.  Remember that they are using microprocessors like the
68000, 68340 (68020 comparible), or 68020 running at 16 to 25 MHz, not the
latest Pentium or RISC processor.  While this situation will improve in the
future, the increase in voice count is likely to eat up any processing
speed improvements.
3.  My impression is that instruments with "1 cent resolution" actually map
some 100 cent / 2^n division to the 1 cent value.  The Ensoniq
EPS/16Plus/ASR-10 certainly do this.  I believe Roland does it as well. 
The actual scale is stored as 100 / 2^n divisions, usually 768TET, not 1
cent.  This could explain why some list members have worse results with
these instruments since the conversion errors are not consistent.  For
instance, if you want to adjust a pitch by +0.6 cents, you would round up
to 1 cent.  The 1 cent value on your synth display is closest to 1.5625
cents, so now your pitch is adjusted by +1.5625 cents, instead of 0 cents
which would have been closer.  Perhaps one request should be to show the
actual cents values to several decimal places, not roughly translated
values or hard to decipher tuning units.
