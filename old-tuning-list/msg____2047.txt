Subject: Bach's Tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Re: Kirnberger's saying to Marpaug that "Bach tune each of his major 
thirds sharp."  This is true in both equal temperament _and_ Werckmeister 
III.  The Werckmeister III contains 4 sizes of major third, one of which 
is equivilent to 402 cents, one that is Pythagorian at 408 cents, 
one at 396 cents, and the smallest one at 390 - all sharper than the just 
386 cents.

Further, Kirnberger himself gave directions for the tempered fifth whose 
ratio (10935:16384) is almost exactly 1/12 of a comma smaller than the 
pure fifth in several publications, including his *Von der Temperatur*.  
The method by which he arrived was to take seven pure fifths in 
succession plus one pure major third.  This gives the tempered fourth 
8192:10935, which is larger than the pure fourth by 1/12 of a comma, its 
inversion is the tempered fifth 10935:16384.  

According to Kirnberger he 
showed this discovery to Leonhard Euler in 1766 and remarked to him that 
this fifth could be used to determine all ratios of equal temperament, 
an idea subsequently developed by Johann Heinrich Lambert and published 
in the *Memoires de l'academie royale des sciences et belle lettres* 
(Berlin 1774) and used by Marpaug against Kirnberger.  (see p. 20 of the 
*Art of Strict Musical Composition* by Kirnberger, Yale University Press)

There is great bitterness against Kirnberger, chief violinist and 
keyboardist at the court in Berlin by Marpaug, the Lottery King Of Berlin.

Clearly, this argument of fifths over thirds is an aesthetic battle of 
historic proportions.  Politics enters at every level and success is oft 
measured by clout.  What intrigues me most about Prof. Rasch's 
perspective is that the Netherlands has been a leader in performing 
"early music" in historic intonation and as its main musical intellectual 
in this area, Rasch bucked the trend.  Perhaps if he were in any one of 
the other countries that had been resistant to historic intonation 
systems, he might have headed the other way.
