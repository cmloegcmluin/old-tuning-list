Post a list of yer top ten, I'll put it up
on Juxtaposition Ezine. Anyone (translation: list members) is wellcome.

The Catler Bros cd is mind blowing but in a totally different
class. Did you ever hear the La Monte Young Forever
Bad Blues Band "Just Stompin'" cd? I didn't get "it"
until I heard them live. Woooah!

So is he only using the 17th harmonic or is he using other 17 limit
intervals?

I'm really tempted to include the 17th harmonic in
my new guitar tuning, but I want to keep the costs down.
