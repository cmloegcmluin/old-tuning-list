The 11-limit tonality diamond has 29 notes per octave, and the 13-limit
diamond has 41. Partchian tonality diamonds consist of all the ratios
where the numerator and denominator have no odd factors higher than the
limit. The 3-limit t.d. has 3 notes; the 5-limit t.d. has 7 notes;
7-limit, 13 notes; and 9-limit, 19 notes.
