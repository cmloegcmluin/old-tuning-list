I don't know how familiar folks are with Blackwood's book. I'm not any
kind of musician. But I really loved the book, because it built a bridge
between my own thinking and more conventional musical ideas.

Before I read Blackwood I had tried taking a couple of Bach harmonized
chorales and figuring out how they should be played in j.t., I think 5-limit
is the right term. Basically the problem is just to figure out which of a set
of nearby pitches to use for each note, the pitches differing by the 80/81
comma. Being a musical ignoramus I'm sure I made tons of errors. But the
exercise really opened up for me the structure of the Bach pieces, or
seemed to anyway. I found, though, that the pieces seemed to turn on a kind
of musical pun, to take advantage of the blurring of harmonic distinctions
provided by temperament.

As I read Blackwood, the point is not so much that e.t. or any temperament is
so much better than j.t. in any universal or absolute sense, but that
mainstream European musical practise at least in the 18th & 19th Centuries
was really structured around temperament, and you can't just slide j.t. into
the classics and make them better. A different kind of music based on
j.t. might be better in some sense, but the structure of composition is
strongly connected to tuning, so you can't change one without some adjustment
in the other.
