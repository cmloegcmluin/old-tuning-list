Many on the list, primarily Bill Sethares (are you familiar with his work?), 
have the opposite viewpoint. I try to emphasize both, since both seem very 
important in defining consonance as I hear it. A third property is close to 
combination tones in its implications for consonance but is perhaps more 
important since it does not require loud volumes: the "virtual pitch" 
property; i.e., the closer the chord is to a harmonic series, the more 
clearly a "root" will be perceived (by the same means by which we hear a 
harmonic series as a single pitch), and the more consonant the chord will 
be.

I'll have to try these different modes out! As you may have read, Gary 
Morrison and I have both experimented with this tuning and fail to hear any 
3:1 equivalence. We hear the nearest approximations of 2:1 and 4:1 in the 
scale as being the closest equivalences, even when square waves are used. Do 
you think Enrique is right that we have been brainwashed and just need to be 
re-brainwashed, or is the experimental evidence for equivalence at a 
(slightly stretched) 2:1 valid? Many studies have found evidence for octave 
equivalence in mammals. . .
