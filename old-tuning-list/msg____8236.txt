Hi I'm relatively new to this list.  I never realized that tuning 
     could be such a technical issue.
     
     Does anyone have any experience using the Pitch Palette with 
     microtunable synths? I downloaded Roland's Virtual Sound Canvass and 
     was impressed with it.
     
     I'm learning this west African instrument called the balafon (type of 
     marimba). My teacher is a master balafonist from Guinea. I've been 
     introducing him to MIDI technology as a tool he can used to test out 
     some of his arrangements/compositions. He really loves it.
     
     As you might have guessed tuning is a problem. He can't play his 
     instrument with his MIDI arrangements, since the balafon tuning can't 
     be adjusted. 
     
     
     It seems like the Pitch Palette microtuning software from Justonic is 
     what I need, since it can retune the Virtual Sound Canvass to the 
     tuning of the balafon. Can this be done?
     
     I eventually plan to purchase the Mallet controller which is a 
     xylophone midi controller. This will allow my teacher to be more 
     creative in his arrangements since this is his instrument.
     
     Comments recommendations?
     
     Thanks
