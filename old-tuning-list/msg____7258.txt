Last Wednesday night in Boston, classical Ottoman music, nominally in
53-equal and employing many clearly non-12 modes, transported the Jordan
Hall audience to another time and place. The piece was very structured
yet employed improvisation within each section.

Thursday night in New York, cellist Ted Mook was featured in a world
premier work by Ezra Sims, as well as music by Harry Partch and others.
Although most of the music was impenetrable as regards melody and
harmony, there was no denying its emotional impact, and there was a
feeling of excitement in the audience of 50 or so that we were at the
cutting edge of Western classical music.

I will post more details if anyone's interested.
