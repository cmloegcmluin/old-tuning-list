   Finishing that thought:  So if indeed it is true that JI does what it
does mostly in the lower harmonics, then the apparent fact that the higher
harmonics are not quite exactly harmonically tuned, is probably not as
interesting.  That would make this concern I'm raising less of a concern.

   But again, Paul has described theoretical reasons to think that that
"apparent fact" is an illusion in, or misinterpretation of, the
oscillograms.  If indeed he's right, then the concern I raised is not a
concern at all.
