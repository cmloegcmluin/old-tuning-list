We should remember also that Kirnberger was an opponent of equal temperament
and claimed that J. S. Bach did NOT use equal temperament. He even got a
corroborating letter to that effect from Bach's son Emanuel.

See:
Johann Philipp Kirnberger, Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik, (Berlin
and Koenigsberg: Decker & Hartung, 1774-79), facsimile repr. (Hildesheim:
Georg Olms, 1968), vol. ii, p. 188. This controversy is recounted in: Rita
Steblin. A History of Key Characteristics in the Eighteenth and Early
Nineteenth Centuries  (Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press), p. 92.
