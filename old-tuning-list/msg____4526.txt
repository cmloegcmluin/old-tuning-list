   I don't think I still have exact measurements of real-instrument
deviations from exact harmonics lying around.  I don't think I ever printed
them out.  And last I checked, my near-harmonic tone decomposition and
resynthesis program was in a rather chaotic state.  It will need some
changes to be reversed and reimplemented before I could make those
measurements again.  

   But the comments I made in this regard, are based upon decomposing
(mostly) orchestral instrument sounds and then resynthesizing them, but
forcing them to have purely integer pitch relationships, and then comparing
the result to the original tones.  Certainly two conclusions were true:
1.  Negating the aharmonicity of an instrument didn't affect the 
    character of harmonies realized in those instrument sounds more than
    realizing them in different timbres altogether, or in other
combinations
    of timbres.  
2.  The main effect of negating aharmonicity was to make the timbres sound 
    "dead" and mechanical, somewhat like the old Hollywood notion of a 
    robot's voice.  
I think I do still have a copy of the executable version of that program
that's capable of doing forced-harmonic resyntheses, by the way.
