Subject: Subliminal Spin

From: Mckyyy@aol.com

Hello again, Gary,

I don't see it as the sort of thing that actually makes it to the
conscious level.  It's a subliminal hit, built into the language
we use, which may mean that it has all the more influence because
it is a vector most of us are not taking into account in our
calculations.

>But perhaps that's not terribly important in the long run.

Perhaps not, but it may also be that the language will change to
place a positive subliminal spin on whatever tunings supplant the
12et regime which would surely be coming to an end.

I personally think that recognizing the connotations of the
language we use is the only way to achieve an objective
viewpoint.  We may decide that the "spin" the language we use
puts on things is right an proper, but if we don't even know we
are doing it, then we are not truly objective.

Also, I've been thinking that there's another way to look at the
whole ET vs JI thing.

Most of the time the discussions of ET I read concern such topics
as selection of the [fifth|fourth|second|etc.] that is closest to
the JI interval.  Or perhaps is the comma 81/80 or 123/120, or
some such.

It seems that much discussion of ET is framed in JI terminology,
so that the study of ET scales could just be viewed as a study of
a limited subset of JI scales--those that approximate ET spacing.
