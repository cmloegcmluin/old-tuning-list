Ooo, great topic, John!


   My microtonal instruments:

10TET:
   Guitar and Bass.  Steel-string acoustic, both kinda cheezy built from kits as
      part of a science fair project in my second year of high school.  Gosh,
      that must have been about 22 years ago.  This was my introduction to the
      field of unusual tunings.  At the time I didn't know that anybody else
      was doing much of anything beyond quartertones.  The bassist who played
      on my music examples then encountered Ivor Darreg's landmark Guitar
      Player magazine article, which contained his address, and thus began the
      big, 18-year string of letters!  Ivor introduced me to John Chalmers, who
      at the time was living in the same city (Houston).  The science angle of
      course was the physics of vibrating strings, as applied to this unusual
      application.   I also have a 10TET fingerboard for my interchangeable-
      fingerboard guitar.
   Flutes.  Undertaken also as a science-fair project, the following year.  The
      science angle was - analogously - a study of flute acoustics based upon
      Boehm's book on the topic along with some research of my own.  That
      project went all the way to the international level, which was held in
      the Anaheim stadium at which time I met Ivor Darreg, Erv Wilson, and Glen
      Prior for the first time.

14TET:
   Fingerboard for my interchangeable-fingerboard guitar (Takamine C132S).

19TET:
   Refretted guitar (I did the refretting), and a 19TET fingerboard for my
      interchangeable-fingerboard guitar.  These are both classicals.

22TET:
   RREEEAAALLL cheezy classical.

7-Limit Diatonic JI:
   Fingerboard for interchangeable-fingerboard guitar.

Quarter-comma Meantone:
   Fingerboard for interchangeable-fingerboard guitar.

88CET:
   Acoustic 12-string (I did the refretting about 1.5 years ago).

Programmable tunings:
   Ensoniq ASR-10, mostly played from Yamaha WX-11.  This is what I use the
      most now.
   A variable-width pulse-wave, digital synthesizer based on a couple hundred
      or so TTL ICs (my design) and run by a single-board 6502-based micro-
      computer (Synertek SYM-1) running software of my design.  This would play
      most any tuning of up to 32 tones per octave, and was played from a con-
      troller that could probably best be characterized as kind of like an
      electronic version of a Chapman "stick" (although at the time I didn't
      know of the stick).  As you might have guessed, this was undertaken as
      another science-fair project.  Unfortunately it didn't make it beyond the
      regional level!
