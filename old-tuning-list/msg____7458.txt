   I don't claim to have used much SysEx stuff to my Ensoniq gear, but I
seem to recall that it implements a "virtual keypad" interface, meaning
that SysEx messages simulate fingers hitting keys of the keypad.  If so,
then in concept I would think that you could retune some note by virtual
keystrokes, then extrapolate (duplicate in all octaves, or whatever
interval) it.

   So then they to have completely arbitrary pitch tables (any key may be
assigned any pitch without regard to how any other is assigned)?
