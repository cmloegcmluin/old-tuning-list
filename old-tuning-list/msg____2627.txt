John C.:
Thanks for the clarification on positive systems.  Thanks also for the
elucidation on "doubly positive."  I had suspected that was the connection, but
because Bosanquet didn't use that terminology, I wasn't absolutely sure.
Digging up a copy of XH 2, I see now that in Erv Wilson's classification of
tonal systems, he goes up to "triply positive" systems; however, he lists no
corresponding "doubly negative" (e.g. 50-tET) or "triply negative" (e.g.
33-tET) systems.

As far as using systems other than 12-tET to determine positive- and
negativeness, I need to study Wilson's article in XH 3 in much greater depth
before I can venture a coherent comment.

John
