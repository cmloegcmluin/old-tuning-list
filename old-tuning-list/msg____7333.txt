As I said, I think that the shortest path to resolution tends to be the
most "natural." A resolution of a leading tone to the tonic is journey of a
semitone, and more natural than the resolution of the sub-tonic to the
tonic, a whole tone. By extension, a resolution by 76 cents, say, is
slightly more natural than one by 117 cents (though I do agree that is just
one factor in the musical context). I believe that string players, for
example, have a natural tendency to slightly sharpen or flatten notes in
the direction of the resolution.

Handel's 16-key organ was the exception, not the rule, and the vast
majority of meantone keyboards had 12 keys. Thus musicians had to decide
whether to tune a given tritone to an augmented fourth or diminished fifth,
and so they might encounter music where they had to play a Db when they had
tuned an C#. Thus enharmonics, while theoretically distinct, had to be
treated as the same for practical purposes on most keyboards.
