I second Gary. If the tuner has plenty of time and sets out by trial and
error at the task of tuning seven tones so that a pentonic of the form 123
56 can be played on each of the seven degrees without any of the modes
sounding different from the others (other than in pitch level), then tuning
7tet without measuring tools is not an unreasonable task. Once an
acceptable model instrument has been tuned up, the experienced tuner can
tune by eliminating beats and will be approximately as fast as someone
working with a digital tuner. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
