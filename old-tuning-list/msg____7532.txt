Hi Gang!
	We just got a Real Audio server at the university and I am 
putting microtonal streaming audio on my web page. Two things:

1. I don't know the law on putting other people's stuff on my page, but I 
sure would like to put some Partch, Darreg, etc. there. Does anyone on 
the list know the law on these matters?

2. I would like to put samples of the music of tuning forum members on my 
page, so if any of you have some microtonal music you would like to post 
there, please send it along and I will! First preference will go to 
ra and .wav files since they are easiest, followed by CDs and audio 
tapes. I do not have facilities for converting DATs. You can email me 
with attached files, or send media to 

John Starrett
3500 Clay St.

I will keep it up until the system administrator slaps me for hogging the 
hard drive.
