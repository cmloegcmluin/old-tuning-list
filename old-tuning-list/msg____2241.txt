This is what Aleksander Frosztega and I got into that big tiff over a
few weeks ago.  I hope not to reopen wounds, but here's a brief summary
of my position:

(1) All major thirds sharp, yes.  Kirnberger admits that.

(2) None Pythagorean?  Nope.  Mattheson claims that (1) implies (2),
    but he is in error.

OTOH, if you can cite a passage in which Kirnberger admits (2), I'd be
most curious to see it.
