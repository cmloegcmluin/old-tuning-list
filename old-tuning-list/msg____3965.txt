Re: Partch Research

It is easy enough to find out what written sources Partch had and when: he
used the California State Library in Sacramento, which through the 1950s
was perhaps the most important reference library in the state and whose
records should include acquisition dates. 

Clearly the most vital sources are Helmholtz/Ellis and Hawkins. Meyer,
Cowell and Barbour were acquired during the development of the contemporary
and historical surveys in his text.

What would be more interesting is, however, to locate Partch´s musical
sources. I have always been struck by the dense harmonic texture offered by
the 6x6 diamond, which Partch makes even more dense through use of
_non-harmonic_ pitches. Besides Protestant Hymns, Yaqui Indian songs, and
Mandarin Lullabies, none of which is particularly rich in harmonic
adventure, what was the _classical_ repertoire that Partch knew (beyond
Chopin)? The other striking feature of Partch´s _system_ is his systemic
symmetry. The other 20th century figure for whom symmetrical structures
were essential was, of course, Schönberg, also predisposed to dense
textures, although Schönberg derived his symmetries from variation
technique and mapped them neatly into 12tet. (I should also note John
Cage´s warning to me (ca 1981) about the use of symmetry in new music: _too
often, symmetry indicates the absence of an idea_).
