Subject: RE: What Is Microtonal Music?

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Gordon wonders if I attend many concerts.  I guess it is hard to imagine
that I know what I'm talking about if one has never been to an AFMM
concert or heard our work.  Please check the repertoire list at the AFMM
web site identified below to see what we have presented over the last 16
years.

Once again, yes I consider 12ET microtonal: however, since conventional
12ET has plenty of forums for exposure and non-12ET has zilch, the AFMM
naturally focuses on non-12ET.  Reasonable?

There are many academic disciplines that are so entrenched in Western
cultural orientation that it is difficult to imagine a cross-cultural
basis for anything, let alone tuning. Suffice it to say that regardless of
my philosophy of microtonal music, I spend my life producing, composing,
and performing "microtonal" music.

The term microtonal is quite significant to me as it indicates the myriad
of possibilities of musical intervals that Western convention negates.
Perhaps if one imagines that "any" interval might be useful in a set of
musical intervals for a piece of music, it might not be so necessary to
get caught up in cultural bias, including etymology.
