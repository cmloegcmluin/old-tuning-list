>Dear SEAMUS colleagues:

>Charles Ives's "Universe Symphony" (1911-1951), for multiple orchestras,
>as realized and completed by Larry Austin, will receive its German
>premiere in a concert-broadcast performance by the Rundfunk Sinfonie
>Orchester of Saarbrucken on May 24, 1998.  Music Director Michael
>Stern will conduct the performance, along with the requisite four
>assistant conductors (including Austin).  The seven orchestras of
>of like instruments will be positioned in four groups surrounding
>the audience.  The work requires a percussion orchestra of 20 players,
>four orchestras of high winds/strings/percussion, an orchestra of
>brass and low winds, and an orchestra of celli/basses.  The work
>is in three continuous movements and lasts 38 minutes.
>
>Technical note: This realization requires 25 separate tempo click-tracks
>for each percussionist in the percussion orchestra (all in different
>tempos, coming into phase every 8 seconds) and the five conductors.
>The click tracks are played back from a multi-channel tape machine,
>whose clicks were generated and synchronized precisely with a computer.
>
>Yawl come.
