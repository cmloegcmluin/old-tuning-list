Subject: Re: Natural Phenomena and Microtones

From: Gary Morrison <MorriSonics@compuserve.com>

I think that Johnny R's most recent series of thoughts regarding
(partly) choosing pitch relationships giided by scientific principles,
natural phenomena, or mysticism, had some very valuable thinking behind it.
 Thanks Johnny!

   I think that microtonal exporation can learn a lot, as music over time
has, from the history and methods of scientific exploration.  Scientific
exploration has shown clearly two very bad attitudes:
1.  Saying that something apparently unrelated to the topic of interest
cannot possibly
    have any bearing on that topic.  (I realize that I recently - well, up
to a point 
    anyway - reacted this way to somebody's proposal.)
2.  Asserting that something apparently unrelated to the topic of interest
really is 
    related based upon no clearly-observable reason.  

   So let's suppose, for example, that somebody builds a tuning system
based upon the orbital periods of the moons of Jupiter.  The history of
science has showed us clearly that there are two very bad ways to approach
this idea:

   The first is to closed-mindedly reject the idea that the orbital periods
of the moons of Jupiter could possibly have any meaning to our ears, and
refuse to even listen to music generated in that manner.  A far greater
mistake is to listen to it with a predisposition against it.  

   The second big mistake is to construct such a tuning, play with it for a
moment, and say, "yeah!  Wow!  That really DOES sound good" and claim a
major musical discovery.  

   A major musical discovery must be thrown open to such questions as
these:
1.  Does a fair number of others also react positively to it, or is it just
you?  
2.  How confident are you that the tuning is what they're reacting to,
rather than the
    rhythms you happened to choose for that particular composition, for
example?  
3.  All in all, do you and others react less positively, or at least
differently, to 
    fairly similar music built upon a different tuning?
4.  Have you composed enough music in this tuning, and in enough variety of
styles, 
    orchestration, texture, and so forth, to be confident that you, much
less your 
    audience, REALLY understand this tuning?
5.  If you can't explain any sort of reason, based upon well-known
principles, to 
    believe that a tuning SHOULD sound great, can you at least describe
what it is 
    about how the tuning touches you that makes it seem so meaningful?  Can
you for 
    example, say something like, "wow, everytime I hear that interval, it
just blows
    me away", or are you merely reduced to aspecific nebulocities like, "it
just sounds
    so right!"
6.  Does it seem to lose whatever quality it seems to have when you
slightly detune its
    pitches from the orbits of the Jovian moons?  Do many others feel a
similar sense of
    loss regardless of factors like, for example, the order in which you
present the 
    two examples?  
7.  Again, regarding original and slightly-detuned versions of the same
composition, 
    using some random means of playing one or the other, can or others you
consistently 
    tell one from the other?  
8.  Ask yourself truthfully (and more importantly answer yourself
truthfully!) what are
    the chances that you're reacting positively to it simply because you
have something
    invested - even financially - in it?
