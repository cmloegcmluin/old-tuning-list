Subject: Re: Artusi's dilemma: a "just" solution?

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hello Margo,

First, thank you for all the great posts to the list. 

Second, forgive me if I'm being dense, but looking at the
cents values for the "Schulter Artusian 5-limit Just" (well,
you didn't give us a name for it), it appears as if it's identical 
to the std. 12-tET in most intervals to about 0.01 cent. 

Am I missing something, or is this a take-it-as-is, theorist
(I mean that in a nice way)solution to Giovanni's conundrum ?
Another explanation/logic/rationale for 12-tET, along with Fibonnaci
numbers,COntinued Fractions, and just reducing the Pyth.comma ?

Regards,
Drew
