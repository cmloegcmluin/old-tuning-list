Subject: RE: Tuning of decatonic modes

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

>}I've worked out that Paul Erlich's Pentachordal modes can be
>}written as 10 JI notes plus three commas of 50/49.  This
>}interval is larger than a syntonic comma, so some tempering is
>}advisable, but it should be small enough for the scales to
>}function as 10 pitch classes.

>In my paper, I mention that in JI, two of the ten notes of the pentachordal
>modes would each require two versions a 50:49 apart. An earlier version of
>the paper (such as the one on John Starrett's web page) had 49:48 instead of
>50:49. That was an error. However, the number two is correct. You don't need
>three commas, just two, and the two are located at scale steps a 6:5 from one
