They are very different. The tritone (the only exception in the 
classification of generic interval sizes according to 5-limit consonance) 
is disjoint from the tonic triad in only these modes. Thus the tonic triad 
of either mode is more stable against the scale than any other triad. The 
tritone resolves to two notes of the tonic triad of these modes in contrary
motion through both instances of the rarer step size (the half step) -- and
the position of the rarer step sizes is what tells the listener "where we 
are" in the mode. So the cadence is a way of saying, "we've been traveling 
around for a while, but now that we know where we are, we're home!" If you 
want two tritones disjoint from the tonic triad, so that they can both 
resolve to it, you use the harmonic minor or harmonic major (major flat 6) 
modes, although one of the notes of one of the tritones will have to 
resolve by a whole step, albeit to a note that is being approached by half 
step from a note of the other tritone.
