Subject: Brian's post on Boulez, etc.

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick online...I must say the Cage/Boulez post had me in
stitches...I would like to comment on Brian's remarks about the NYC
versus West Coast school of tunings...here in Denver, there seems to be
a real natural interest and curiosity about microtunings, both from
musicians and just plain folks who have seen some good press on the
subject and are curious...I have tried very hard to present this often
intimidating and poorly understood subject in simple, funky terms, and
it seems to be working...my 12 to 16 year old students think it's cool,
my musician friends are very open to discussing tunings, and the media
folks (except a few turkey butts) are behind us as well. It's really
simple to me...there are no schools, no adversaries, no style of music
that is better than any other...there is only music to be composed and
performed, the more the merrier...and, if it touches people's hearts as
well as heads, than that is a wunderbar thing.
    I have met many interesting and talented folks since I started
playing other than 12/oct music, and I hope we all continue to help,
advise, and critique each other in an honorable fashion...there is a lot
of music to be made, and I truly feel that "microtonality" is on the
brink of becoming very popular, I really do. Does that mean MTV and
People mag? Well, that's OK with me if it is done, once again, in an
honorable and dignified fashion...even with humor, as well. I think we
are on the verge of the biggest explosion of art since the 1960's, and I
plan on having a ball with it...by the way, Brian, I lost page 9 of your
"Gentle introduction to the EQ tempered scales"...since I often give
this to folks who are interested in "Microstuff", can you possibly get
me that page? Thanks...Hstick
