From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

< there is a history of attempts to identify "the

<8.2021: Bohlen, Pierce
<16: Goldsmith
<19: Salinas, Yasser
<20: Balzano
<24: Wychnegradsky
<31: Huygens, Fokker
<36: Gawel
<41: von Janko
<53: Mercator (did he strictly look at 3-limit? Who was the first to
note
<the applicability of 53 to 5-limit?)
<72: Richter-Herf (Partch missed this in his list -- it would have
<disturbed him that an ET could come so close to 11-limit JI!)
