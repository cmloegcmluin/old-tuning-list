Drew, as I say, I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but some 
samplers (eg., Roland S770 series, Akai S1000 series) keep sample 
looping parameters in ROM.  On the Roland, for example, up to 512 
samples (ie, the total number of samples that can be loaded at one 
time) can be looped any which way you like and it will make no 
difference at all to the amount of RAM that is available.  I'm sorry, 
I can't tell you if this is the same on the EMU units, but I suspect 
that, on these, as you say, looping may eat into RAM.  

This is all I was referring to, not questions of detuning.
