Subject: the elite

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Although I admire what Neil Haverstick is doing for xenh music out there,
I take issue over his comments on elitism. This concept is often confused
with unfair exclusion or discrimination, which are not good. But elitism
that comes from excellence, profundity, difficulty, and similar concepts,
especially when they are together, is not only unavoidable but desirable.

There must always be things done by and for a small number of people. The 
notion that everything must be available to and understood by everyone 
who wants it has led to some of the difficulties we now face in 
education, for example, where students demand degrees, jobs, and money 
simply because they exist, whether or not they have qualifications or 
know how to think, work, or relate to others.

I hope my point is understood. Even though Neil isn't saying any of these
things, there are many who do or at least imply them. 

I would argue that there is room for both popular and elite (unpopular?)
art, there always has been, and there always will be. Without an artistic
elite, important elements of culture cannot thrive, and without an
educated elite, the major professions would collapse, and with it most of
democratic society.

I can't talk much about the popular, unelite side; but nothing above 
should be taken to mean it is lesser or negative, for without it, other, 
equally important principles and structures collapse too.
