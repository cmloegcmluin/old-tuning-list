   I didn't ask how they were selling, or whether they were continuing to
produce them or not.  They definitely didn't volunteer comments to that
effect, but that probably doesn't mean much.  It definitely does appear in
the brochure they had at the flute convention, but I don't know for sure
how new or old that brochure is.
