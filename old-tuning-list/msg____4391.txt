Posters on this lists seem always to view the scale as a "template"
for ALL other music.

I view the scales as individual works. I found explanations to how the scales 
are formed. Intervals in a melody, or for that matter, notes in any part in 
progression of chords, are like a passenger sitting inside a train watching a 
sequence of electric wire posts sweeping past. When the spacing is in a regular
pattern, he finds it normal. Just as if interval arrangements follows some
sort of pattern in a _balanced_ manner, the listener then finds it in tune.

The western major scale, the Chinese major scale, the mean tone and the 
tempered scale, all conform to this logic.

But those are the easiest pieces of "work" to analyse.

Back in October, I read a paper in a conference in Shanghai which I 
explained exactly when and why two identical melodies in the "Butterfly 
Lovers'" violin concerto must be played differently - by exactly a 81/80 
comma on certain notes.

There is an exact reason why every note in every good piece of music
must be played a particular intonation that is "correct". There is a natural 
law which many classical composers fell into. And breaking this law became 
the Art for subsequent composers.

Once I played a little of a cd recording of the "Butterfly Lovers'" violin 
concerto (not by me) at my home, and asked my maid whether she thought 
the violinist was playing well or not. She exclaimed "Why, is that a cd. 
I thought it was your friend playing!" She thought it was the man who sold me 
my violin. He just manage to play some violin, but no where near good. My maid 
did not notice the accompanying orchestra on the cd. She just noticed how 
the violinist played out of tune.

Yes, I played this concerto, with a piano, two weeks ago, and will play
again twice in January. The audience likes it, and wonders why I sound
better than their cd's at their home, with orchestra.

One new pupil is studying this concerto with me for her first lesson
yestersday. She is ten years old and got distinction in her grade 8 LRSM 
exam. And she noticed that the lovers were actually dead, when I showed her
how the ending melody should be played, differently from the beginning.

John Chalmers heard a little of my playing on tape in my car. On the
"Spanish Dance" (in a minor key), he commented that my playing improved 
a lot (actually, it was just "correct". On the Meditation, which I told 
him I was playing in the "Chinese scale", he said, "It sounds very 
expressive"  which actually, just exactly how the composer intended.

That is exactly what I teach. Which particular pitch on which note, on every
note.

I make myself, and my choir, sound normal. And make the others sound
different.
