RE: Partch Bio

I spent the summer reading Gilmor's Partch bio.  The research was excellent
and I consider it to be certainly worth the price.  Gilmor goes a bit off
the deep end with his occassional psycho-analysis of some of Harry's
sitations/ characteristics ( I find it hard to believe that Harry's
homosexuallity was caused by him being circumsized (sp?) at the age of
eight!) -- but, hey, Bob Gilmor is a musicologist -- and I think a very
good one! It is not an "upper" read but I think very accurate to Harry's
ideals and stuggles.

The day I finished it the new Lou Harrison bio (Miller /Lieberman) arrived
and that was like turning on a different light- very true to Lou's life but
very "uP"- the celebration of a composer.

Both books need to be read by us folks.

Also the Robert Erickson bio by Charles Sheer published by Fallen Leaf
Press (?) is very good.

That's what I think-
