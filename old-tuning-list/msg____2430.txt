Subject: Ensoniq MR rack

From: marcus@fa.disney.com

I was reviewing the tuning digests and rediscovered Steve Curtin's October post
regarding the MR:

> While I'm here though, there's a new synth we've just announced called the
> MR-rack, which is the first synth shipped with my Midi Tuning Standard
> implementation.  Both the bulk dump and note-change messages are supported,
> and the product's been tested with JICalc on the Mac and Midi Tuning Wrench

So, like, has anybody on this list tried this?  How would I get a copy of
JICalc for the MAc?

Does the bulk dump let you arbitrarily remap any frequency to any key?
How long does it take to do a bulk dump; that is, can you make many bulk dumps
during a performance?  etc., etc.

I use Cubase on my Mac Powerbook, which, to the best of my knowlege, does not
support the bulk dump.  Anybody know of a sequencer that could record the bulk
dump messages along with your key events?

Thanks,
Marcus
