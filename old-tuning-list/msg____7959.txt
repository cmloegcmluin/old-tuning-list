Subject: How to contact Mr. Rankin

From: Robert Lodge <rlodge@motown.lmco.com>

I am looking to get an interchangeable-fingerboard guitar. I have writt-
en to Mark Rankin in Redway,CA asking about the fingerboard kits that I
understand he sells as new-old stock.No reply;I wrote in early May,just
after talking to John Schneider at the Friday MicroMystery Tour concert.
  Am I just being impatient or does any Forum member have info on better
ways to contact this supposedly reclusive fellow? If so, please e-mail 
me at rlodge@motown.lmco.com
  Also, does anyone know of a source for tangless, glued-on frets? These
would make fret application possible for those of us with no woodworking
tools.         Thanks, Bob Lodge
