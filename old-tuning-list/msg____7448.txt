Subject: RE: delurking (synthesizer tuning capabilities)

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Roland/Yamaha tuning table resolutions are extremely poor (aren't 
they)Seems like that outweighs any ease of use advantage they 
have.Ensoniq : 256 increments per half-step,@0.4 cents !

Someone recently mentioned the Kyma,I think.That has the equivalent of 
@10,062.461 increments per half-step, @0.01 cent/0.0026 Hz 
resolution.But! ->Cost: $4400 to @$8365 ,:-)

If only synth manufacturers implemented the MTS to the letter.

Later,
