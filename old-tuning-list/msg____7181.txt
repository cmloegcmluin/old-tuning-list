Subject: Irix version of Scala up on ella.mills.edu

From: Steven  Rezsutek <steven.rezsutek@hq.nasa.gov>

I just plopped a version of Manuel Op de Couls Scala program 
compiled or SGI machines on the mills ftp site in:

   .../ccm/tuning/software/other/scala-1.41-IRIX5.3-binary.tar.gz

(Yeah, I finally got one of those little beasts of my own. :-)

It contains the same files as in the PC distribution, with the
exception of the Irix executable.  Testing has been minimal,
but I believe everything should work OK.  You'll need some
external program to do tuning dumps [I'm still working on 
getting something going myself], and will have to edit the .cmd
files appropriately.

Have fun.

Steve
