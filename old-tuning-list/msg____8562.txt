Subject: RE: Cancelling out beats

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Bram, I don't think you're understanding the phenomenon of beats, which
arise as a result of the limited frequency resolution of the ear. You
should do some auditory experiments to convince yourself that you're on
the right (or wrong) track.

Paul H., the nonlinear processing that the ear does actually increases
the frequency resolution over what the standard uncertainty relation
would give for an analyzer with the ear's temporal resolution, thus
decreasing (rather than creating) the incidence of beats. But you're
exactly right about Sethares.
