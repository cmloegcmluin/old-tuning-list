Subject: Fungus/CAGE

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

My provider was down due to the power outage and still has some
port problems, so I'm a bit behind in answering  my mail

RE CAGE: As a former Neurospora and yeast geneticist, pot-hunter, 
mycophagist and ocasional imbiber, I will state that no one who likes 
fungi can be all bad, even as a composer. Despite a few adolescent bouts 
of athletes' foot before I gave up excercise, I've gotten far more out 
of fungus than fungus has gotten out of me. Actually, I was referring
as much to Cage's influence as his music. It seemed for a while, that
every experimentalist had to define his or herself with respect to John
Cage.
