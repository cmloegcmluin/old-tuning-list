Subject: Herbert Anton Kellner's Bach tuning

From: wabi@server.net4you.co.at (Helmut Wabnig)

To Tuning list and Harpsichord list:
In Tuning Digest 462 I posted a frequency table for the
Kellner Bach tuning. Now I got hold of Kellner's original work
and found that his numbers are slightly different.

Deviation from Equal temperament:

       Kellner       wabi

A        0.0          0.0
B        4.3          4.189   
H       -0.7         -0.888        
C        8.2          8.099
Cis     -1.6         -1.676
D        2.8          2.830
Es       2.3          2.234  
E       -2.7         -2.843
F        6.2          6.144
Fis     -3.5         -3.631
G        5.5          5.470
As       0.4          0.279
A        0.0          0.0

The numbers differ more than 1/10 cent and I have to 
recalculate them. Consider the possibility that I did
a mistake. Or it is due to rounding errors.

My impression is, that Kellner's work is not widely known.
Otherwise it could not happen that some people still think,
Bach was mean tuned. Absolutely impossible.
Some think, Bach was equal tuned. He might have known ET.
But could he possibly tune it in 15 minutes, as some say?
Can you? Can anybody? Bach's tuning can be laid quickly,
easily and very precisely. (Kellner's words).
ET came with the advent of the piano, and is suited for it,
which has less overtones than a harpsichord.

Anyway, the main arguments are of a quite different nature.
Bach was an eminent mathematician and numerologist. 
Kellner is mathematician and physicist, built several
harpsichords on his own, received a patent on his Bach tuning,
and analyzed the codes in Bach's music. This had been done before,
but proving that the tuning scheme for the WTC is modeled into the
structure of the music, that's where the evidence comes from,
has to be credited to Mr. Kellner. 

The most astonishing discovery, at least to me, is something
quite unexpected, unbelievable surprise:
Bach himself has coded his tuning scheme into his signet!
The seven pure fifths, the five tempered fifths, the 
"three-unitarian" tempering are hidden in that graphical emblem.

Luckily, the small introductory booklet "Wie stimme ich selbst 
mein Cembalo?" is available in three languages, German, English
and French. It costs about 30 $, give or take some.

If we don't read contemporary publications, we are going 
to miss a lot. Can you suggest some further reading on this topic?
Please post it, if it is rather new and modern.
As for me, there is no question how to play Bach and
especially the WTC. The Kellner Bach Tuning
may be inappropriate for other music, but it is worth a try.

My digital piano has 6 temperaments, but the new types have 
microtuning capabilities. They can be programmed for any tuning.
Electronic tuners with microtuning are also available.
So, thanks to the Japanese, and Mr. Kellner et al, we can get the 
original sound of Bach's music into our living rooms. 
Midi files of the WTC are on midi archives in the Internet.
I like listening to midi music, because it is free of "interpretation",
which does not interest me.

Yours
