From: Heinz Bohlen <Heinz.Bohlen@mptp.cpii.com>

First of all: Greetings! I'm listening to the list now for several weeks, and I
find it exciting. My deep felt thanks to Enrique Moreno who introduced me
to it.

Secondly: There seems to be some emotion around the question whether
the diatonic scale is based on the major triad, and wonderful
expressions like "historico-geographic fallacy" are thrown into the ring. I
never had an opportunity to read what Mathews and Pierce have been
advocating in this regard. However, when I (some time in the early
seventies) was in the process of "discovering" what has been since
dubbed the Bohlen-Pierce-Scale,  I tried to come to terms with this
question, too. And I guess I still see the answer as I have seen it at that
time: the diatonic scale is the result of the INVOLUNTARY attempt to fill
the framework of the octave with the major triad and its sub-intervals,
and finally inserting small intervals created in the process to achieve
equidistance. When trying to make harmonic music, and that was a
cumbersome process during the middleages, the triad must have been
present on the minds of the composers, whether it was "invented" at
that time, or not. Okay, here you got my personal opinion, now shoot at
me!

By the way: I am interested in everything that Pierce or Mathews or
others have been writing on the "Bohlen-Pierce-Scale", and I promise to
send a copy of my first publication on the subject (alas, in German, and
only as long as stock lasts) to everybody who can help me out regarding
this matter. My address:
