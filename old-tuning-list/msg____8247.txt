Subject: Xenharmonikon, Margo

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

At long last, Xenharmonikon 17 is out. This issue is 124 pages long and
contains articles by Carter Scholz, Heinz Bohlen, Brian McLaren, Paul
Erlich (the 22 tone scale article),Douglas Leedy and me (on superparticular
ratios). There is also a posthumous article by Larry Hanson on notating
34-tet and a cover by Ervin Wilson showing the 1.3.5.7 hexany mapped over
an octahedron. 

XH is available from Frog Peak Music at http://www.sover.net/~frogpeak.

Tables of Contents of all issues are located at John Pusey's WEB pages. 
Johnhas informed that his site has a new URL, but one can follow the
link from John Starrett's site (HIGHLY recommended, BTW).



Margo: Welcome to the Tuning List! I know that a number of us have
been awed by your Pythagorean Tuning and Early Music FAQ.
