Subject: too high to hear ...

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

Televisions make an awful racket, even when their
speakers are turned off:  a regular, high-pitched
squeal.  Even when the volume is turned off, I can
tell when the TV is on in the next room.

The ear is specialised tissue that evolved from touch.
There is no reason to assume that we hear only with our ears.

I think our brains are acutely sensitive to a myriad range
of electromagnetic fields; some of us are aware of it,
most are not.  Partly, I think we are desensitized for
practical reasons -- there is so much background noise,
including from our own bodies, that it's only sensible
to filter out most low-level signals.  But, my word, they're
certainly there !  Like the "silence" of a summer's day
in the country.
