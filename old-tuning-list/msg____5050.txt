I'm afraid this will get you no further: it can never be the case that 
one well-tempered scheme will give you a C# (and not a Db), while 
another will give you Db (and not C#). _Any_ well-tempered scheme will 
simply give you C#/Db -- neither can be in a favoured position. The only 
way I can construe you here is to conclude that you are confusing well 
temperaments with other keyboard tunings, like meantone, which don't 
close a chain of fifths into a circle. If this isn't the case then I'll 
be happy to hear your explanation, but from what you've said so far I 
can't come to any other interpretation.  

While you haven't said anything to suggest it, how about this: is it 
remotely possible that you were thinking of, say, two notional 
well-tempered schemes, one of which would give you a very good 
approximation of a 5/4 above A, while the second would instead give you 
a similarly good 5/4 below F? So the first you would call your good C# 
tuning, and the second your good Db tuning? This is as much as I can do 
by way of speculating about your intentions. I'll wait to see what you 
have to say.

What, if they have two ranks? Vishnegradskij managed well enough with 
two pianos: each is in standard 12TET, but in relation to each other, 
they are tuned a 2^(1/24) apart. I still find it a little comical, 
because I'm tempted to listen to each part separately -- the musical 
style was not particularly daring for its times, beyond the tuning 
aspects; but perhaps I should try harder.
