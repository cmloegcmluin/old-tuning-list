Subject: Re: History of the Diatonic Scale - Aristoxenus and Ptolemy

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

If I may second Jonathan Walker, who wrote:

''Trying to pick your way  through this and other arithmetical
contradictions can lead, I am convinced, to only one honest conclusion:
that Aristoxenus should be understood as providing us with essentially
vague, musicianly descriptions, which are distorted if we begin to squint
too hard at the details, and try to endow them with more mathematical
rigour than he ever countenanced --''

As John Chalmers has more than once pointed out, the classical harmonicists
 had the mathematical means to calculate string lengths for equal
temperament, yet did not do this. Aristoxenian units - like s.rutis - can
perhaps be best heard as the smallest conceptual units through which a
practical musician, especially a singer, can perform. Jonathan Walker
points out one notorious example where Aristoxenus's example simply does
not add up, but the _idea_  of  tones and limmas (semitones) can be an
efficient and useful one for practical music-making. (I think that Johnny
Reinhard makes an analogous claim in advocating a cent notation). I find
Aristoxenus to be a poor physicist or psychophysicist but perhaps, in a
broad sense,  the first cognitive scientist! There is much to the
perception of pitch relationships that is independent of precise tuning -
the perception of serial aggregates, or the group properties that Prof.
Balzano has investigated, and Aristonxenian units fall into this category.
