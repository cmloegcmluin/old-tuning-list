Subject: Re: Tuning at Boston Early Music Festival

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net>

The Boston Early Music Festival is next week (instrument exhibition the
11th through 14th) and I recommend it as a place to experience historical
tunings.

I personally will be tuning clavichords (and maybe a clavicytherium and
virginals or two) for builders Jack Peters of Seattle and Thomas Gluck of
Vienna: early little clavichords in Pythagorean tuning, Tosi clavichord in
Meantone, Huberts in a well-temperament to be named later (when Thomas
tells me) and Tannenberg at equal.

Is anyone else on the list doing anything there we should know about?
