Subject: Tritriadics, etc.

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Re Tritriadics :The idea for tritriadics is from A. J. Ellis's 
appendix to Helmholtz's On the Sensations of Tone in which he derives 
56 tonal 7-tone "trichordal" modes in 5-limit JI by allowing the tonic, 
dominant and subdominant triads to either major or minor and then 
circularly permuting each scale (8 x 7 = 56). The concept goes back to 
Rameau. What I did was to generalize the type of triad and apply the
idea to MOS and similar scales in ET as well. 
 
One is not limited to only 3 triads or to triads. Some scales are 
best chorded with 5  triads, 4 tetrads, etc.
 
Max Mathews, Linda Roberts and John R. Pierce have also experimented
with this kind of scale, especially those based on 3:5:7 and 5:7:9.
The Pierce-Bohlen scale in based on 3:5:7:9 triads mapped into the
13th root of 3/1 (This ET has also been proposed by Enrique Moreno).
Unfortunately, none of their published papers actually give the
ratios or notes of the 4 scales they discovered. Does anyone have
the M357a, M357b (the P-B scale in JI?), M579 and P3579a scales? 
 
JI: One of the major themes of Brian's recent posts on psychoacoustics
was that subjects tested in the laboratory prefer sharp to JI intervals.
While there is considerable data supporting this idea for single voice 
melodic intervals, it is not necessarily true for intervals in chords. 
Roberts and Mathews (1984) found that for the middle tone of various 
triads (major, minor,  5:7:9 and 3:5:7) some listeners preferred JI and 
some preferred intervals either sharp or flat by about 15 cents. 
Preference correlated with musical experience, violinists, cellists and tympanists preferred JI, untrained musicians, singers and pianists 
preferred the "rich" non-JI intonation. In these experiments the outer 
tones were tuned pure and the inner tones varied. In the case of minor 
triads, the "rich" intonationists preferred the flat 300 cent interval 
to the JI value. 
 
Similar results were obtained for chords in I IV I progressions.
The roots of the triads were 262 hz. In the case of the progressions,
the subdominant was taken from a major or natural minor scale on 
262 hz. The 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 progressions appear to be taken from the corresponding tritriadics, but I have not been able to verify this
yet.
 
The point is that while musical experience has a strong effect
on preference, though how one separates musical experience clearly
from musical talent has never been clear to me, some listeners not 
only prefer JI for major and minor chords, they also do so for 7-limit
chords as well. Secondly, while some listeners prefer sharp
intervals, others prefer flat ones or have no preference for the
direction of mistuning. They just like beats. These data imply that 
JI has a distinct "mood" which many, but not all, listeners prefer.
 
The principal reference is Linda A. Roberts and Max V.Mathews. 1984.
