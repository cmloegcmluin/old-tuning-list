Murat,

Some but not all soundcards (I have heard the Turtle Beach Tropez
does) support the MIDI Tuning Standard. In that case Scala will tune 
it. In the other case it's not straightforward and you may have to use 
pitch bend commands somehow. The EXAMPLE command in Scala only allows
you to do rudimentary things. Otherwise, calculate the pitch bend
values with Scala and insert them in a sequencer for the different
channels that are needed. 
There is no Win3.1X version so you will have to switch back and forth
to DOS with the MIDI-files as intermediary. Perhaps I'll get to giving
it a graphical user-interface in the future but until now I wanted to 
concentrate on functionality.
