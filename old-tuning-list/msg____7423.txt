From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Any forum folks in the Denver area might want to come to Stella's 
Coffeehouse on Friday, April 17...Junko Shigeta on koto and myself on 12, 
19, and 34 tone guitars will be giving a concert from 9/11:30 PM, doing 
some traditional Japanese pieces, and some modern collaborations in other 
tunings. Stella's is at 1476 S Pearl (I think, it's close, anyway). Post 
me if you want more info...Hstick
