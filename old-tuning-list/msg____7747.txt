>>Clara Rockmore, beloved friend, mentor, consummate musician and virtuoso
>>of the theremin, died peacefully at 9:30 Sunday morning at her home.
>>
>>Her family was at her bedside during the last few days of her life, and
>>just two days earlier she learned of the birth of her first great
>>grandniece. Clara had previously said, "If it's a boy, he'll be another
>>Jascha Heifetz. If it's a girl, she'll be a Clara Rockmore".

>>So we shall hope.

>>An obituary will appear in Tuesday's New York Times.  Funeral services
>>will be held the following day.
>>
>>Clara's death signals the end of a chapter in the extraordinary story of
>>Leon Theremin and his remarkable instrument.  Her life and artistry will
>>serve as inspiration to carry on the truly fine theremin tradition that
>>she established.
