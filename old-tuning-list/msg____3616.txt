Subject: New York meeting/  German Parade

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

I will be playing with the Mad Bavarian Brass Band Saturday 21/Sep/96
in New York, for a very big German-American parade. You can meet me in
the big tent at 2PM. The adress is 96, fifth avenue. I will arrive with
the parade, and will wear white socks, black shorts, white shirt. I will
be playing trumpet, some of you probably knew that already. You are all
invited to follow the band, bring your instrument if you think you can
fit in the group. The evening will be in a hotel, so you dont have to
worry about where you will sleep. I think it costs 5$ to get in the
tent, and if you want a hotel room, you will have to pay a part of the
price. This is our chance to meet other xenharmonists.

Talk to you soon, 
-Kami
