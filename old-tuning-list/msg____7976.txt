Hi Drew:

The note was helpful in #1435.  I think I was wrong that
Unisyn will do what you need with the FB-01. 
But MAX is not expensive (certainly old version 2.5
which will accomodate some on-the fly pitchbend like
you're proposing) and is useful for many other
composing needs.

It'd help to know what the whole system (including
guitar-midi and Finale(?) is meant to do.  I know what
it's like being *short on cash* - which is why I myself never
got into Finale!

What comes to mind is the guitar controller running a 
MIDI device through MAX.  Could sound fun.  You might find
a KORG 05R/W cheap - plus they're very small.  Nice
sampled sounds, guitar, harp, etc.

If you simply need to hear some Xen tunings then I'd look
into a software-only product, Like the old MusicWorks
that did 8-bit additive and such.  How does that $15 program
of Chadabe's called "M" do?  Anybody?

Cheers
Rick S.
