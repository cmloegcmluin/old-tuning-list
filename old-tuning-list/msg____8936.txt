Greetings, 
   I recently read the following post on another list, and thought it may be
of interest to the Tuning crowd.

"Early last month, at the Illinois State Music Teachers
Association Convention, Karin Redekopp Edwards, Michael Dean and Daniel Horn
premiered a work for three keyboards tuned 1/8 of a tone apart by George
Arasimowicz, the excellent composer who serves as Dean of the Wheaton College
Conservatory.  Though George really imagined the work as being played on three
acoustic pianos, logistics forced us to use one Steinway D and two Kawai
electronic keyboards.  An ear-opening experience was had by all."
