Tune-entities!

Johnny Reinhard posted in 1606 (the digest, not the year) a tidbit about
Partch uttering his support for Johnny's use of synthesizers nearly 40
years before the fact.

Just wanted all of you to know that, in spite of the collegial nature of
the list, and the pointed comments directed to me, Johnny didn't have the
courtesy to write me  first, off list, to discuss this. So I'll have to
make a response here, as his point deserves an answer.

Unfortunately I am doing 10-11 performances a week right now and it
deserves more than a knee-jerk reply (well, besides this one!). I'll try
and get it together and stay up late to make sure the record is clear.

Oh, BTW: I don't strike things from the record when they are historical
documents. Revisionist history gives me the creeps.

Stay well, folks...

Cheers,
Jon
