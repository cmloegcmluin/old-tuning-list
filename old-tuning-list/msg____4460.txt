AULD LANG SYNE

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
 And never brought to min'?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
 And auld lang syne?

chorus:
For auld lang syne, my dear,
  For auld lang syne,
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
  For auld lang syne.

And surely you'll be your pint-stowp,
 And surely I'll be mine,
And we'll tak a cup o'kindness yet
 For auld lange syne!

  (chorus)

We twa hae run about the braes,
 And pou'd the gowans fine,
But we've wandered monie a weary fit
 Sin' auld lange syne.

  (chorus)

We twa hae paidl'd in the burn
 Frae morning sun till dine,
But seas between us braid hae roar'd
 Sin' auld lang syne.

  (chorus)

And there's a hand, my trusty fiere,
 And gie's a hand o'thine,
And we'll tak a right guid-willie waught
 For auld lang syne!

  (chorus)

The words are by Robert Burns, who adapted an old traditional Scottish 
ballad. The language is Lowland Scots. People usually sing, "For the sake 
of Auld Lang Syne", but they're wrong. I can't remember whether it's his 
or the older version that has 'my Jo' instead of 'my Dear'. I think it's 
his.
