Paul: Your recent post  on the extent to which various ET's  
articulate the harmonic series is an interesting and potentially
useful set of data. The data are very relevant to the process of 
mapping JI constructs in ET's.

To expand a bit, 22-tet expresses the 4:5:6:7  dominant 7th chord as 
7:6:5:4 degrees of 22-tet and thus distinguishing each interval of a 
second or 3rd (8/7, 7/6, 6/5 and 5/4) with a unique  span roughly 
proportional to its JI width. Fifteen-tet distinguishes the 16/15, 10/9 
and 9/8 as 1, 2 and 3 degrees though it wildly distorts the the 
differences between the intervals. Still the major scale is recognizable 
as a  "nearly just" scale (As "nearly just" is an oxymoron in English,
I proposed the term "dicaeoid," or "dikaioid," which means the same
thing and sounds more "academic," if nothing else.)

William Stoney did something  similar with function called HarFac in 
the paper below in which he scooped  Erv and me. Back in the late 60's 
we had no idea where we could publish an article on computer generated 
tuning tables and the analysis of various ET's. (We didn't include a 
HarFac, just the raw error of each harmonic and subharmonic interval, 
alas.)

Systems", pp. 162-171 in The Computer and Music, H.B. Lincoln ed.,
