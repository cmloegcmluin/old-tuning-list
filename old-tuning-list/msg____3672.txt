Subject: problems with jic again

From: sashabog@cats.ucsc.edu

i'm a grad student here at ucsanta cruz trying to do last minute preparations
for my class i'm teaching this quarter on just intonation. (more on it at a 
later time)now i'm having to main problems with jic
1) i'm trying to send my tunings from jic 4.21 on my powermac to an tx8iz and 
it seems to respond with the message " midi buffer full" and seems to get a very jumbled
up version of the tuning. Does anyone know how i can get around this?

2) now i'm tryingg to send my tunings from jic 4.1 on a mac se/30 to the same
tx8iz and it seems to respond fine, only know i want all the tunings i have on
the 4.21 version (on the powermac) to be transferred to the 4.1 version (on
the mac se/30. How do i do this? I read in the help section that disk can do it
but its quite vague. where does it save it and how to i transfer it?

Can anyone be of help to this poor grad student to get his class up and running?
thanks in advance.
