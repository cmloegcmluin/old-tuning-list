I've been trying to catch up with a lot of list messages, and among 
them I noticed the above passage; I've looked for a subsequent 
retraction/correction but can't find any; I've also tried squinting 
at it in various ways in the hope that the words will somehow make 
sense, but with no success.

First, an ad hoc definition: let's call any key (or mode) that is 
in keeping with the chosen set of pitch classes in a meantone 
system an "available" key (or mode). In this context, I am 
excluding the notion of enharmonic equivalence from  "pitch class". 
On a keyboard of twelve notes to the octave, for example, the most 
common choice of pitch classes (in the 15th/16th centuries) was:

            C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, G#, A Bb, B

Given this choice, the major keys of Bb, F, C, G, D and A are all 
"available", in the given sense (I am speaking only of the 
availability of pitch classes for precisely these keys -- of course 
even a simple piece in Bb is likely at some stage to require an Ab, 
and similarly for the rest). No other major keys are available, 
since they must utilise wolf intervals, e.g. the dominant triad of 
E major will consist of a diminished fourth plus an augmented 
second in the given meantone tuning, rather than a major third plus 
minor third. I know perfectly well that this is all common 
knowledge, but I have to get the issue of enharmonic equivalence 
out of the way to avoid confusion.

Now in any available key, thus defined, a given interval type is 
uniform in size, not only in this key, but also in all other 
available keys. Thus, in a given meantone tuning, the third from C 
to E will be the same as the third from F to A and the third from G 
to B. In 1/4-comma meantone, all these major thirds will be just, 
as will any major third in any available key. In any other meantone 
tuning, the major thirds in available keys will not, of course, be 
just; for any meantone tuning based on a rational power of the 
syntonic comma, there will, of course, be at least one just 
interval class, but aside from 1/4-comma, where maj. thirds and 
min. sixths are just, the only other meantone which was chosen (in 
the period from 15th - 17th centuries) to produce just intervals of 
musical interest  was 1/3-comma, with just min. thirds and maj. 
sixths.

What on earth, then, is the meaning of the passage quoted at the 
top?  The fact that 1/5-comma meantone has just, i.e. 15/8, major 
sevenths in no way distinguishes the tuning of the dominant chord 
in an available key from the tuning of the tonic chord; likewise, 
1/3-comma doesn't distinguish between the tuning of subdominants 
and tonics in available keys.

In any available key, a given meantone system will no more favour 
one triad over another than it will favour one presidential 
candidate over another.
