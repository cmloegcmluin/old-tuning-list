OTOH, just because something is old doesn't mean that it is wrong.
Actually Babylonian astrology and astronomy was very good.  The Greeks
bastardised it (astrology) for roughly the equivalent of trash
horoscopes in women's magazines today.  It does not require the planets
to be gods, only to influence life on earth.  It may even be that the
idea that they are gods came from the scientific observation that they
do influence life.

If you doubt this, I recommend that you read Michel Gaquelin's books.
In his second book (or maybe later) he addresses the issue of Babylonian
astrology.  He does this because his truly scientific study showed that
some ancient astrology was right and some wrong.  On tracing the errors
back he found that they were introduced in Greek times but he did
require new and careful translations of some ancient texts.  It is all
based on good scholarship.  Gauquelin's work has been confirmed in
multiple studies with samples of about 30,000 each in several countries.
The same significant results were found each time.
