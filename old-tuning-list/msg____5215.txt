John,

For a simpler example, take the definition of 2nd-order maximal evenness 
with respect to the series 12->7->3. By your definition, diminished triads 
are 2nd-order-ME as well as major and minor triads. This is because, after 
deriving the diatonic scale as the 7-deg ME scale in 12-tet (which is 
historically fallacious, but never mind for now) you pretend that the 7 
scale degrees are actually 7-tet when determining the 3-deg ME scale. Then 
you remember the actual 12-tet positions of the 7-tet scale, and using them 
you translate the 3-deg scale back to 12-tet. In my definition, one keeps 
the 7 scale degrees always in 12-tet, even when determining the closest 
approximation to 3-tet. Then only major and minor triads are obtained.

In case that wasn't clear, imagine a clock. First you take a disk with seven 
equidistant arrows pointing away from the center. No matter how you rotate 
this disk, the numbers on the clock face that come closest to the arrows 
form a diatonic scale. That's just 1st order maximal evenness. Now, on the 
SAME clock, put a disk with three equidistant arrows. No matter how you 
rotate it, the diatonic numbers derived previously that come closest to the 
three arrows will form either a major or a minor triad. (If two arrows each 
fall exactly between two notes, which happens with probability zero if you 
"spin" the disk randomly, and you decide to round one arrow clockwise and 
the other counterclockwise, you can get either a diminished or a suspended 
triad. But such cases should be disallowed, or else you can conjure up some 
funny results of 1st-order ME, such as a 12-out-of-22 scale with intervals 
1-2-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-2-2-2, which I'm sure you'd disallow as well, although 
there are other reasons for liking this scale!).

Your procedure requires two clocks, one with 12 hours and one with 7 hours. 
You put the 7-arrow disk on the 12-hour clock, the 3-arrow disk on the 
7-hour clock, and then translate from one clock to the other. So your 
procedure requires more construction and more abstraction (the translation 
process) than mine.

Anyway, stepping up to 22->12->7, you'll see that my definition does not 
require the additional rule that there be only one tritone, which apparently 
you derived from Jay Rahn (what possible justification is there for this 
rule?), in order to isolate the four gramas.

I view this as little more than a curiosity since, if you buy this theory as 
an explanation, you still have to explain where the three numbers 22, 12, 
and 7 come from. But I thought this would be interesting to you.

I have a paper on 22-tone equal temperament in the upcoming Xenharmonikon. I 
have two new scales (one ME, one not) that have more of the important 
properties of the diatonic scale than any other scale ever invented, save 
perhaps the pentatonic scale. A 7-limit (tetratic) TONAL system is the goal 
and this goal is attained. I also discuss plausible derivations of the 
22-tone quantification of the Indian system. Finally, I propose an unequal 
22-tone tuning in which several transpositions of my new scales as well as 
well-tuned (close to JI) Indian scales are available. I'm having my guitar 
refretted to 22-equal . . .

I look forward to hearing from you.
