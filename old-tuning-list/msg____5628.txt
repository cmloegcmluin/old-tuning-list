Glad the festival was a success. 

How do you think the soundboard became detached, was the case OK? Did the
glue melt? Will it survive more travel?

Did you get the last message I sent, or are you just catching  up on e-mail?
'cause its about time to start scheduling/planning the chamberflux. I have to
nail down the rest of the AGO show in the next week or two as well, so we
will have to be talking a bit more.

Got Toast CD-DA 2.0, it's much better than the dumb old masterlist cd.
Got another short film to do next week, but not much budget.
Sent off the Maza cd yesterday.
Julia has learned "I can see clearly now the rain has gone" and Star Trek NG
theme on the accordion.
Gonna install a 1.2 seagate internal drive in the computer next week (its on
the floor in a box).

Say Hi to Becky.
John
