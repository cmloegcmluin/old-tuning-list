Subject: RE: Post from McLaren

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

I must say I hadn't recogised Brian's remark as a joke either and was
about to post a reaction when Paul was ahead of me. But I was aware
that Brian was dissatisfied with this aspect of the CPS command. How
he produced the 9-tone equal-tempered scale like this is still a
puzzle to me. As far as I know there's no bug involved, but only the
fact that decimal numbers with a full stop are interpreted as cents
and not as linear factors, as they are pretty consistently throughout
the program. To relieve the shortcoming, the next release of Scala
will have a extra version of the CPS command. 
As long as I don't know what Brian has exactly entered there's no way of
telling if there is indeed a bug.
The current version isn't a beta version however, when it was released
it was well tested and there were no known bugs. There are a few minor
ones now, to be fixed in the next version.
