This is true, but why must any effects be gravitational?  When you turn
on your TV or radio, the e/m field associated with the light in your
room and your body emmanations vastly exceed the e/m waves of the TV
channel or radio station (your gravitational effect is greater too :-)
And yet you can pick it up quite clearly!  It is all a matter of
resonance and tuning.

Too right!

To some extent.

You are right.  Most astrologers cannot do astrology properly.  However
there are some very real effects which have been demonstrated by Michel
Gauquelin and a few others.  Astrology was bastardised about 2500 years
ago to make money from innocents and has been that way ever since.

Forget gravity.  There are many low frequency e/m waves in the solar
system.  I believe that these are responsible for, amoung other things,
the location of the planets.  See the diagram at
http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/plan-wav.gif which shows the
planetary distances in relation to two periods of e/m waves, 160 and 6
minutes.  These periods also appear as oscillations in the sun.
There is evidence that such periods exist as strong e/m waves.

Low frequency waves also affect humans.  This is a fact.  I am talking 1
to 100 Hz here, but I expect there to be harmonics of the 160 and 6
minute waves present in the solar system also.

Gauquelin's very scientific work definitely shows (and has been
replicated) that the position of a planet relative to the horizon
(not the stars) at the moment of birth is related to profession and
personality.  It has subsequently been proven (through inherited
planetary configurations) that the pre-existing nature of the child
chooses this moment rather than the position causing the child to be
something.  So the child sort of says "this signal is my cue".

I agree that you will find very little benefit from astrology as it is
practiced.
