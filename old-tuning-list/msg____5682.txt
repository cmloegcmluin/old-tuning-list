Subject: Daquin CD

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

I am not holding a classical harpsichord CD in just intonation
in my hands every day, so here's the title. Highly recommended.

Louis-Claude Daquin: Premier Livre de Pie`ces de Clavecin,
Suites 1-4. Anne Robert, historical harpsichord Hemsch (1751).
BNL Productions, 1991, BNL 112809. Auvidis distribution. DDD 78'20"
Intonation pure.
Exactly which tuning is not specified. Anne Robert has also recorded
works of Balbastre (on CCS-ADDA) and Froberger (on BNL).
