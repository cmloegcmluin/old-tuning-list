Subject: Indian music

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

It is very difficult to speak in terms of ''Indian Music'' in the singular.
On the subcontinent are two ''classical'' traditions (North Indian - or
''Hindustani'', muslim musicians to the contrary, and South Indian, or
Karnatic) with extreme variations within each that share a common Sanskrit
theoretical tradition. Certain broad musical characteristics are shared
between these traditions, but the shared characteristics between North
Indian and Persian Music or between Karnatic and Singhalese music are just
as rich and audible.

My experience with Karnatic music is more extensive than with Northern
Indian music, but I am certain that the Northern tradition enjoys a larger
pitch vocabulary, and in certain styles cultivates a large number of varied
intonations for single srutis (including SA and PA) even within a single
rag. Some composed rag sections will have certain pitches firmly defined
intonationally, others - particularly the slow, improvised Alap - will vary
radically. In any case, the intonation chosen may follow a particular style
belonging to a school of performers or a single guru. And even though the
drone will create a prominent harmonic background for a performer, often
part of the performance dynamic is to deviate audibly from the drone
pitches or their harmonics.

One great difficulty in dealing with subcontinental musics - not unfamiliar
elsewhere - is that the performers, even noted artists, are very uneven in
their intonational skills. A certain Kirana vocalist favored by many in the
tuning community, could be extraordinarily precise in his performances, but
was frequently completely off, and would often deliver a beautifully
intoned alap only to follow up with a composition that was extremely rough.

In Karnatic music, the tuning is rather more stable throughout the
tradition (although 12tet has made inroads in recent years, particularly
with the advent of mandolin and guitar performers, as well as the
introduction of electronic keyboards) and limited to a set of 12 named
pitches, which may vary by a comma much as Rousseau has described,
particularly in the ragas where MA moves to a sharp fourth degree (contrary
to a lot of literature, this pitch is fixed around 45/32, not the 11/8 that
many claim to be hearing). The precise intonation of a Raga varies with the
particular tradition, guru, and with the particular composition, but the
value attached to tuning is high: as T. Viswanathan put it to me: Sing in
tune or go to hell!.

It has long been surprising that an electronic microtonal keyboard has not
been commercially produced in India or Pakistan. It seems like a product
that would have a great domestic demand as well as a potential for
profitable export to niche markets abroad (like American microtonalists!).
Maybe some list members have concrete ideas. Perhaps a 12 (Pyth)+10 (comma
varied) keyboard with a variable fundamental frequency would be sufficient.
