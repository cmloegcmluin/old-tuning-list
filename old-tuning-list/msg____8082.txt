In the recent discussion of wish lists and tuning implementations,
one practical point has been overlooked.  It was not "Ensoniq" the
company that gave us their implementation -- it was Steven Curtin,
who was in charge of the tuning implementation while he worked there.
Likewise, E-mu's David Frost was more or less singlehandedly responsible
for the Proteus tuning implementation.  Tuning is not and never will be
a priority for a manufacturer.  The best we can hope for is a sympathetic
and knowledgable individual within a company who is willing to devote
his or her time and energy to make it happen.  Talking to programmers
is far more likely to be productive than talking to executives or
marketing types.
