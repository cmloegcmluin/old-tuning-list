I don't know the specifics of either group or category theory, but
this is definitely something like what I do with matrices.  You can
define scale "families" by a basis (primitive group?) and define a
practical scale as a finite subset, usually octave repeating.  This
works for ETs, linear temperaments and JIs.  Beyond that, you just
have to specify all the intervals in cents.

The matrices are used to convert between bases.  Beyond that,
scales really aren't complicated enough to justify bringing in
standard mathematical theory.
