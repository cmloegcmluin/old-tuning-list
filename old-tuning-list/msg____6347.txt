For an thorough discussion of that very thing, get Mathieu's new book
"Harmonic Experience".  It is the most amazing description of how music works
of anything I've ever seen.  It delves deeply into the way that 12-tET is
used to both approximate and ignore 5-limit JI.  Perhaps "ignore" is not
quite the right word; he explains the uses of 12-tET that cannot be
interpreted in terms of JI, as well as those that can be.  He also provides a
method for internalizing all that stuff, so that you can both feel and
analyze what's going on in a piece of music.  While it considers only JI and
12-tET, the principles transfer easily to any other tuning.

IMHO, it should become the de facto music theory text throughout the Western
world.  It really does seem that good to me.
