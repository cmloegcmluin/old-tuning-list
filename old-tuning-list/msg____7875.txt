Sorry everyone, pressed the send button prematurely.  There's no 'are

It seems reasonable that there are many different explanations of 
what serialism and atonality are.  Rather than try to define these 
terms, try listening sometime to (not meaning to patronise):

Schoenberg: Verklarte Nacht (Ensemble Intercontemporain, Sony)
Berg: Piano Sonata (Barenboim on DG, maybe)
Berg: Violin Concerto  
Schoenberg: Suite op 25 (Pollini on DG)
Berg: Wozzeck        
Webern: Funf Satz fur Streich Quartette Op. 5 

Clearly, none of these works are 'serial' (Boulez came later) nor are 
any of them wholly 'atonal' - although the Op 25 Suite pushes that 
way.   But I would say that a familiarity with some of these works 
would be the best introduction for getting any understanding of 
'serialism' proper - although, apart from a short period of 
experimentalism in the 50's, it would seem there are extremely few 
_strictly_ serial works (Boulez Structures Book 1, for example).   

You might perhaps find Barraque's "au dela du hasard", for example, 
quite incomprehensible without the above background.  But in certain 
passages, when the vocalists sing in various sixths and thirds etc, 
there is little doubt that the intention depends on consonance if not
just intonation.   (A 3 CD set of Barraque's complete works (in 
stunning digital) has just been released on cpo.  There's nothing 
Xenharmonik here, but it is fabulous music.  However, in case 
anyone's interested, please note that the performance of the Piano 
Sonata by Stefan Litwin is horrendously slow - much better seek out 
Roger Woodward's indispensable account on LP (not available at the 
moment)).

My point about consonance being relevant to atonal/serial/"complex" 
music is simply that the (relative) consonance of 12-ET was  
important to its development - a point echoed and developed nicely  
by Graham Breed:

Schoenberg did indeed have a piano.

and I find this very plausible, having argued along these lines 
myself.  However,

Hmmm.  Schoenberg was an accomplished string player, from an 
early age, deeply familiar with playing 1st Viennese School.  He was 
also a regular concert goer.  So ------    But Graham, do you have a  
source for the claim in your last sentence? 

Also

ermmmm, nice idea, but look at some scores;  yes, it occurs.

>However, I see no need to explain his general style as anything but 
>an _avoidance_ of integer ratios.

But a greater 'avoidance' (say, using 11- or 13-ET) would never have 
provided Schoenberg with the language he neeeded.  So it surely can't 
be as simple as that (?)    

On another tack: 

I asked:

>>I would therefore ask Paul whether, when he does the experiment

Paul E replied:

>I think my point would be made with any of those timbres.

Did you try it?  In the very small interval you mention, I find it  
extremely difficult to be clear about what I hear and what I imagine 
I hear.  However, try sweeping a trumpet through an fifth 
(putting up with mickey mouse effect) against a 1/1 drone, and 
comparing this to the same sweep in a violin.  Personally, I don't 
find the peaks and troughs identical (although they are very 
similar).  

My point is not that this would have special signifiance for a tuning 
system (since, all instruments considered, things will even out), but 
 merely that the notion of *ratio* as the unique explanation of 
'intervallic' character is not complete.
