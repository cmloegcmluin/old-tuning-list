Subject: Yet another non-posting reader

From: Howard Rovics <rovics@usa.nai.net>

I have been a "non-posting reader" for the past two years until 
this past October when, in the course of changing to another server I 
lost contact.  Johnny Reinhard told me that he was encouraging  lurkers 
to  decloak. Curiosity got the better of me and I quickly rejoined. I'll 
introduce myself and I'll try to state why I like this forum.

	I'm a composer/pianist and Professor of Music at a college very 
near to New York City. I teach theory and composition on both undergrad 
and graduate levels, some music one for the non-musician, piano, MIDI 
studio skills and all kinds of electives when they come around. All of 
my composing has been in 12-ET but quite diverse, both tonal and atonal. 
It was Stefan Wolpe who challenged me 35 years ago to question 
everything and to be wary of conventions, especially those of standard 
notation. Early on I loved to extend the sounds of the piano with 
inside-of-the-piano exploits and keyboard manipulations that would 
elicit  harmonic resonance.

	 In 1967 I began a three year stint at the Columbia-Princeton 
electronic Music Center while living on Manhattan's upper West side. I 
am indebted to Mario Davidovsky  and others for some insightful 
training. Here, in this presynthesizer studio where most compositions 
were created with 3 or 4 stereo reel-to-reel tape recorders, hand 
splicing tape like it was movie film, pitch would drift as the vacuum 
tubes warmed up and precise time synchronization was all but impossible 
to achieve. And so I created a number of spacey things, developing a 
taste for elusive pitch and floating musical sound shapes that were 
disassociated from meter. 

	I also had my first hands-on experience with computer music 
around this time. There were no video monitors yet. It was punch carding 
in the basement of the Columbia U computer building, waiting for your 
stack to run upstairs, and if successful (a rare event) the digital tape 
they'd hand you  would have to be sent to Westchester (some 40 miles 
away) to be converted into analog, a two or three day delay. I decided 
to drop out for a decade or so after one semester of this. It was the 
hardest imaginable way to make music. I did learn o appreciate those  
hardy souls who did the pioneering and made it work. In that decade 
before the PC, in addition to lots of 12-ET composing I did some writing 
for percussion ensemble, a lot of free improv related to the study of 
music therapy and several summers of vocal improv along the lines of the 
Harmonic Choir. All of these musical experiences expanded my sense of 
sonic resources. 

	The rest is "modern times". Early in the '80's I embraced the PC 
starting with Radio Shack's Color Computer and IBM's PC Junior and 
became reasonably adept at the practical technologies that are around, 
namely desktop publishing, MIDI and high quality home studio recording. 
A short course with Johnny Reinhard some seven years ago quickly turned 
me onto this world of the xenharmonic. Soon thereafter I took a semester 
in the physics of sound at a nearby university and a lot of the math 
that surrounds acoustics and sound engineering started to make sense. 

	And so I hang around this forum to enjoy the poetry of 
engineering ( sometimes, understanding something),  the world view that 
permeates xenharmonic thinking; recommendations in regard to CD's, 
software and books and what feels like a glimpse into what Johnny calls 
"the beginning of the future." 
	
	Visit my home page if you'd like to get better acquainted.  
There's nothing xenharmonic there yet but I'm working on it.
