Subject: Re: Octave Generalization

Though I haven't looked up the full article, I would like reply to the
following abstract that John posted:

It sounds to me like all this proves is that the experimenters could not
explain to children what they meant by "similarity." Certainly there are a
lot of different dimensions along which sounds can be judged as similar or
dissimilar. These experimenters did not prove that octave generalization
was not among those dimensions, as they claimed to have, but only that if
given a vague direction, children will choose another criterion of
"similarity."

When my two-year-old first matched pitch, he did it by singing a clear
octave above a pitch I sang. I can't say whether this "concept of
'octaveness'" was of "experiential or perceptual origin," but it is clear
to me that children (and not just my own) judge octave-transposed melodies
as equivalent long before their fourth birthday. Otherwise would they only
be able to learn songs from their mothers?
