Subject: Re-Tunable PC-Based Synth/Sequencer

From: "Just Intonation" <justintonation@hotmail.com>

A guy on the synth do-it-yourself list yesterday turned me on to a 
PC-based synth/sequencer program called VAZ+ ( Virtual Analogue Synth 
Emulator Software ), which only costs $35 USA! It has a Master Tuning 
preference. I don't know the exact details in terms of whether pitches 
can be specified as frequencies and/or in cents, how many tones per 
octave are allowed, or what the tuning resolution is, but I've e-mailed 
the company and the person who told me about it, and will post any 
further info when I get it.

   There is also a free demo of the program (which DOESN'T contain the 
re-tunability feature) available for download, for anybody who would 
like to check out the more general features of the synthesis and 
sequencing aspects of the program.

   This looks like an entry-level product that the alternate tuning 
community can really get behind, so please try it out, if you get a 
chance.

   VAZ+ requires either Windows 95 or NT. This is because 32bit 
performance was essential for the program. On a 486/66 PC playback at 
22kHz is possible. A Pentium system will easily manage 44kHz. The 
program defaults to a conservative 11kHz settings when first run.

   Full details and screen shots of the synthesis and sequencing windows 
are available at:
