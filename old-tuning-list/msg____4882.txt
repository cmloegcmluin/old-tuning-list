I, for one, would certainly not be scared off the list by such a discussion.

I am particularly interested in the ideas you call "virtual pitch, residue 
pitch, complex tone pitch, fundamental tracking, and possibly periodicity 
pitch, I have been working on this for some time" and I'd love to see some of 
these ideas posted to the list.
