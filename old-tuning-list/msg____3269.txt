I have seen neither TD 600 nor XH16, but I thought I'd throw in my 21.5 
cents:

Well, in Paul Rapoport's point of view, 22 would fall into the same category 
as 27, 41, 46, and 53, where syntotic comma (81:80) displacements are 
necessary to get good thirds, and if 27, 41, 46, or 53 is traditional, then 
so is 22. Paul Rapoport's notation probably deals with 15 and 34 in the same 
way. Is this correct?

However, I'm not aware of much of a "tradition" of notating comma 
displacements in actual musical practice, so I'd have to say the only 
traditional tunings are 12, 19, 31, 43, 50, 55, etc.

I have a feeling I would have a bigger problem with Paul Rapoport's system, 
since it seems the minor third and its purity are being ignored. It's that 
consistency issue again. If the best approximation of the perfect fifth 
minus the best approximation of the major third is not the best 
approximation of the minor third, a notation based on just 5-limit intervals 
is not appropriate for the tuning. In 20tet, for example, the perfect fifth 
is 12 steps, and the closest approximation to the major third is 6 steps, so 
should the minor third be 6 steps too? No, 5 steps is a far better minor 
third. This seems to be a fatal blow to notating 20tet with Pythagorean 
scales and syntotic commas. However, I should shut up now because I haven't 
read Rapoport's article.

Getting back to 22tet, I've written a paper on it, which includes a very 
convenient method of notating 22tet based on 7-limit harmony. While 
traditional notation and musical practice benefit from the vanishing of the 
syntotic comma in traditional tunings, 7-limit notation and practice will 
benefit from the vanishing of the septimal comma (64:63) in 22tet. This 
paper is in the process of being rethunk for the purposes of publication, 
but I've been e-mailing around a summary of my current ideas to a few tuning 
list members in exchange for additions to my music collection. Any more 
takers?
