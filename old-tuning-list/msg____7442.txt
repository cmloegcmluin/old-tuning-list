   Uhmmm, I must be missing something here:  Why do you disagree that
Ensoniq has the best microtonal povisions, if you have to limit yourself to
12-tone scales and use SysEx codes on the Roland instruments?

   My information may be out of date, but I'm not personally aware of any
other machines with greater tuning flexibility than 8 (4 easily switchable
at a time) completely arbitrary pitch tables (any key may play any pitch
within the sound generator's range and pitch resolution) per
instrument-sound.

   But I'm glad to hear an independent confirmation of my comment that
Ensoniq doesn't have as much purely musical or synthesis capability as, say
the K2500.

   I'll see if I can convince my K2500-playing friend do write up a summary
of why he finds the K2500 to have been designed by martians.  I've heard
lots of little bits and pieces, but I'd certainly be interested to hear a
summary, if he has the time.
