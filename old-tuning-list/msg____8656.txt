The first reference I saw to tuning Indian scales as
a string of 3/2s was in the following book:

Donald Lentz [1961]
_Tones and Intervals of Hindu Classical Music_
University of Nebraska Studies, Lincoln.

See pages 6 and 12 - 16.

However, although Lentz describes the tuning procedure
as 11 perfect 4ths upward and 11 perfect 5ths upward,
he gives 5-limit ratios for some of the notes in the resulting
scale, rather than all 3-limit ratios (which would be correct).

I too am interested in learning more about Ayyar's
7-limit ratios.

I have just found a webpage discussing Indian tuning.
Haven't read it yet, but here it is:
