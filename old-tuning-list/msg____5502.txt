   Whoops!  Sorry, that's Otonality, not Utonality.

   How would that sound?  Well, it's kinda difficult to describe in words.
It's fair to say certain things about it:
1.  It has as many different sizes of steps as it has steps, so it doesn't
    have that feeling of whole- and half-steps.
2,  It's probably fair to say that, to 12TET trained ears with little experience
    in unusual tunings, it sounds very strange, especially harmonically.
