Subject: Thank You Very Much

From: Peter.Blasser@oberlin.edu

Thank you very much for your kind response.  John Chalmers is awesome,
and I will definately pick up a copy of "Divisions of the Tetrachord.  I'm
just a first year student
here, and I plan to make a Kithara as my winter term project.  I've made
several before, but I plan to add an "arithmetically progressed" fretboard
based on 16/16 utonality.  Although I am quite a newcomer, I still
find the modal approach to harmoniai more worthy than the verbose syntax
of the volume in which it is expounded.  I think that such phenomena as
the perfect fourth interval that is being "transposed" throughout the
series of modal harmoniai,  the removable bulbs on auloi, which can be
stacked on one another, and the ease of an early human to construct an
arithmetically proportioned instrument to be very valid points.  The
fact is, though, it's just a theory, and I would never debate with you,
who evidently have more experience in the whole field of Just Intonation
and tuning.  Nevertheless, I plan to research and critically restudy KS
book.
   Along with classics at Oberlin, I am pursuing a major in
TIMARA/ComputerSci.  I would like to write a user friendly just intonation
program that includes many ethnic models as well as extended Partch
theories.  The keyword is user friendly- I would like to make it possible
for the most amateur to explore these possibilities, but yet it wouldn't
be a toy.   Do you think this is a noble cause?
   And finally, what kind of jobs do all of you "tuners" have?  What kind
of tuning related careers would be open to me when I leave college?
   Thanks for living with my naivete.
