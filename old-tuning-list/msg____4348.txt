Subject: Tuning program progress report

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

Just a brief update; it would appear that - by virtue of circumstance
and some listener requests - my tuning series is going to be spread over
3 or 4 separate programs. This is, in part, due to the fact that y'all have
been very generous with sending tapes [yo, Sethares - I'm still waiting....].

It turns out that a number of listeners seemed to want to hear some of the
stuff they *don't* have. This means that the big request is Partch's "Delusion
of the Fury" on Columbia, for example. A couple of listeners wanted to know
why I wasn't doing quarter tone pieces, too. SO - the first program is going
to be some kind of "traditional values" program; 20th century works by "the
old guys" (Blackwood, Partch, Darreg, Ives q-tone, Johnston,  early Riley, and a
bit of *really* rare LaMonte if I can dig it up, etc.). The next set will be the
"new guys" (that's *you* lot), and - I didn't exactly think of this - one
listener
wanted a program of non-western music (this is still on the drawing board)
for #3.
#3 might wind up being a bit of a mix, perhaps.

By virtue of dividing it this way, I can opt for more of the works you submitted
and not appear to be slighting Ivor for Carter Scholz, etc. Given the
season and some
other stuff, I think the shows will be spread out to one/month for the next
3 months,
with the first one being this Sunday.

I am *really* going to keep to my usual rules about not spending half the
evening
blathering on mike (the work is lots more interesting than my opinions of it. I
know that some of you may be surprised to learn that I'm the very sould of
brevity
on-mike), so I'll have to *really* encourage folks to call me if they've
got questions.

Thanks again to all of you for your work and for your advice. I think that
!12tET.2 is
going to be the third week in January (weeks one and two are traditionally
the long-form
"Best releases of 1996" program, where folks get to hear 15 or so minutes
of each disc
instead of a lousy soundbite. As a side note, "Music from the Isle of
Anaphoria" - which I
commend to your hearing - is on the short list this year).

With regards,
Gregory Taylor
