Subject: RE: midi files

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Marcus, there is a lot of stuff here:

http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/

Maybe also code to read and write standard MIDI files, I don't know
but it is not too difficult to write it yourself and it still depends
on what you wish to do with it.
The MIDI file specification is here:

http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/midifile

It contains two routines in C for writing and reading a variable length
number.
I am currently writing code for writing a MIDI file, not in C, but let
me know if you need help.
