i've written a tuning tool in kyma that sends the bulk tuning dump to the
Emu proteuses and the ensoniq mr-rack.  the tuning dump conforms to the
midi bulk tuning dump spec.  it takes about a second to update the entire tuning table,
so i don't bother retuning in real time.  i have not tried to do the real time tuning
adjustment.

i use the mr-rack and kyma to do all my microtonal music because they're
the only commercially available products that i'm aware of that let you
have non-12 arbitrary tunings.  when i first started reading this thread, i became very
excited because i was hoping that someone out there would reveal another
synth that i hadn't considered that let you do arbitrary tunings.   i sure would like
to have more sounds!
