No, it doesn't support your theory at all.

I would say that this interval is more likely to be heard as 13/8 than
25/16 because 13 is a lower odd number than 25. Of course, there are
other ratios that this interval is even more likely to be heard as. I
brought in the point about primes simply to point out that simple prime
factors _don't_ count for much acoustically, and that ratios like 64:45,
despite their low prime factors, are never really the just "target" for
a harmonic interval.

If you really think so, then I must suppose you have really failed to
understand my views. No offense, but my honest opinion is that, rather
than trying to penetrate a theory or style of music and see it as a
logically or aesthetically consistent whole, you focus on whatever
elements fit into your point of view, whether you're talking about
Schoenberg, Robert Johnson, or me.
