Assuming we have a blank slate with respect to tuning, what would be the
extent to which tuning is defined by the form of the music, and vice versa?
When would we care what tuning a piece of music is played in? If we have a
blank slate for tuning, I assume we also have a blank slate for rhythm or form
or any possible combination of sound and silence which will appeal to the
mind. What are the limits?
