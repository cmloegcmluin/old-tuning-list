Subject: 3rd Newband CD released

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

If the following URL is to be believed:

http://www.musicandarts.com/DigitalClassical.html

the long-awaited 3rd Newband CD has finally been released (on a new label).
According to the above URL the new CD is entitled "Dance of the Seven Veils"
and contains the following cuts:

Harry Partch: Castor and Pollux (1952)
Anne LeBaron: Southern Ephemera (1993)
Elizabeth Brown: Archipelago (1990/92)
Dean Drummond: Dance of the Seven Veils (1992)

Please see the URL for ordering details.  I do not know if this CD is available
in stores.

For those of you who thought I fell off the face of the Earth:  close, but no
cigar.  I've just been real busy over the last year and have been in readonly
mode (sometimes skim-only mode) on this list.  I shall try to rectify that in
the future.

Speaking of CDs, whatever happened to "19 for the 90s"?

John
