Subject: MICROSTOCK report

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

The first MICROSTOCK festival was held last nite in Denver (October
21), and was quite successful. John Schneider played just intonated
guitar, Johnny Reinhard and crew from NYC did a number of original
pieces (several by Mayumi Reinhard, who is a marvelous composer), and
the Haverstick band did all original rock/blues/jazz/country influenced
pieces in 19 and 34/oct eq temperament.
   There were about 120 folks there, and most stayed to the very end
(and it was about a 3 hour gig)...we got good press before the show in
both Denver daily papers, a radio interview on the local Public radio
station (KCFR), and there were a lot of people around town aware of what
was happening. Both Reinhard and Schneider were very impressed with the
way things turned out, and the audience was really trying to hang in
through a wide assortment of some very challenging music...I myself was
very pleased.
    The whole show was financed by personal friends who bought airline
tickets, put up the performers at their houses, and generally pitched in
in wonderful ways for the sake of the music, not to make money (although
that is certainly not a bad thing...maybe next year). So, why can't
other people around the world do this exact same thing, in the interest
of promoting "microtonal" music? It was not that hard to do, and we
generated an enormous consciousness of our music in the Denver area, and
hopefully blew a mind or 2 in the process. Come on, you guys with nice
day gigs...why not band together and put up a little cash, and let's
have festivals like this everywhere...it would go a long way in the
interest of changing the incredibly boring state of western music.
    I want to thank all the musicians who came to Denver to play, and
all the people in town who helped to make this event a really unique and
special project to be involved in...and believe me, we're just getting
started...Haverstick
