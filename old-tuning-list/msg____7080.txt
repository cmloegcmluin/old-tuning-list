Subject: forum CD

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

We're close indeed...numerous folks have contacted me to express
interest in participating...at this point, here's who I have as con-
firmed: Haverstick, Starret, Morrison, Taylor, Sethares, Loffink,
and Sanford...Paul Rapoport, Warren Burt, and Bill Alves were mighty
close...if you guys are in, please post me privately to confirm. Fortuin
and Genovese are interested as well. So, what if we get more than 10
people who want in? One of 2 things: we all agree to slightly shorter
pieces, or some folks wait until next time. I am confident that we can
work all this out in a peaceful way.
    Other comments: my studio guy prefers DAT's with a 44.1 sampling
rate...also, I would like cassettes of the pieces, as well as the DAT's,
so I can hear the pieces and arrange an order to the CD. And, I would
like to wait until March 8 to get rolling, as I am doing a musical
until then and don't have the time. After that, it should go pretty
quick. PS... please send a short bio of the tune you submit, for in-
clusion on the liner notes...this is going to be a great project...
we have a lot of talent to offer...Hstick
