Subject: Clavichord concert -- music of Jane Austen

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net>

I will be giving an informal clavichord concert in Fall River Mass., 50
miles south of Boston, on Sunday, July 13 at 3:00 at the Lafayette-Durfee
House (built by Durfees in 1750, Lafayette slept there one night in the
1790's, now a museum) at 94 Cherry Street. "Music from the Private
Collections of Jane Austen", including Handel's Water Music in keyboard
transcription, Haydn's Sonata no. 48 in C, of which we have an actual
manuscript copy in Jane Austen's hand, and a number of country dances and
sentimental songs. I'll probably be using Young's temperament, I may also
bring a fretted clavichord in meantone for the Scottish Songs and country
dances if there are likely to be people there interested in such things.
Audience limited to 40 (aside from the softness of the clavichord, we're
holding it in the kitchen, the largest room in the house!), reservations
recommended. Call me (508)674-6128. (or of course e mail).
