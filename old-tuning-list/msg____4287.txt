Subject: wolves: last words

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

The term _Wolf_ and its plural _Woelfe_, were established tuning terms in
German in the early sixteenth century, and were rapidly imported to English
as _wolf_ and _wolves_. The fact is, the name was chosen because of a
perceived resemblance of certain intervals to the howling of wolves. As
wolves' calls do have a distinctive steady beating, and are often
dichordal, this is not an unreasonable metaphor.  Any qualitative judgement
about this sound is a function of time and place, and we are now - given
our modern, urbanized reverence for animals - free to admire both sounds,
and recognize certain similarities, much as listeners in the past
apparently found both sounds disagreeable, while recognizing similarities.
Your regular ( -s) ending for a synechdoche form is without precent
grammatically and unnecessary, because the term _Wolf_ was used initially
as an unaccompanied noun, and not in the adjective-noun combinations (_wolf
interval_, _wolf tone_) found later (my earliest example is nineteenth
century - but Jonathan Walker may know an earlier source). As I indicated
before, the _wolf_ is a metaphor, and a metaphor must retain the declension
of the borrowed term. 

Furthermore, English has so few surviving Germanic plural endings that it
certainly adds to the surface variety of our language to be able to use one
when we can!

Let´s get back to tuning...
