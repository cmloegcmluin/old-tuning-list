   Actually you might be surprised, because there are patterns you can use to
derive, and more importantly to remember, them.  One easy example is forked
fingerings on woodwinds.  This is a little bit of an overgeneralization but it's
mostly true:  The more toneholes you close below the highest opened tonehole the
flatter that note gets.  Similarly on brasses, there are certain valve
combinations that are known to tend to be sharp or flat.  So the problem is
essentially one of quantifying and memorizing.

   Not too difficult you think eh?  Perhaps this isn't saying much, but I know
that I couldn't do it.  

   Let's assume that you have notation system that can augment each note-head
with information for both frequency-ratio relative to a tonic, and with the
choice of tonic itself (it would be pretty hopeless otherwise).  Let's also
assume that tonics don't wander (without cent-based notation that would utterly
hopeless although pretty feasible with it).

   The composition is notated in C Major.  Two bars back you saw a notated
tonic-shift to A, and somehow the notation somehow prescribes that to be a 5:3 A
relative to the C of the key signature.  You encounter a sequence of four
quarters in 4-4 time at 120bpm (a moderate pace of notes).  The notes are:

                C# with an 11 over it (meaning 11th harmonic of the A),
                D with a 4 over it (meaning the usual 4:3 to A),
                B with a 10 over it (meaning 10:9 to the A),
                F# with a 5 over it (meaning 5:3 to the A).

OK, let's play it now.  Here's what you think:

  "The shift to the A tonic happened four seconds ago, you got that, right?  It
was an A right, or was it D like the last time?  Yeah, A.  OK the first beat of
the is coming up measure;  better get the first note out.  A.  Let's see that's
a comma-shift upward.  No downward.  Downward, right.  Everything is shifted a
comma down from what the harmonics tell me.  First note C# as 11th harmonic.
11the harmonic is pretty much right on a quarter tone.  So does that mean that I
play a quartertone sharp or flat of a C#?  Flat, right flat; that's our
convention.  Wowwy, this half-second-long beat sure has gone by fast!  

   Whoah, that clarinet just played a real klinker on the half-beat there!
Should I adjust my pitch?  No, that's OK, that's pretty much what it sounded
like in our one-and-only rehearsal.  Never mind that; time's a-wastin';  I'd
better get back to get this C# out!  OK so we've got a quartertone flat of a C#,
so that's this fingering.  No wait, this is all relative to A, not C, so I have
to go down a comma from there.  I guess that would be this fingering instead.
Right.  OK ready to roll...  Now where's the beat?  Ooooookay, right ... NOW!
Switch fingerings.  

   How does it sound?  Ooop, a little flat.  Probably better lip it up a tad."

   That's a pretty full half-second of your life!  Those extra steps of
remembering how an 11th harmonic is tuned, and then offsetting that by how much
an A is tuned relative to a C sure would be great not to have to work out!
