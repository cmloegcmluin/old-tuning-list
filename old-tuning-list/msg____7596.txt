If the total tension of the strings were held constant, then there is no
reason that tuning to an unequal tuning would lead to less tuning
stability than one had in equal temperament.

That seems contrary to the evidence as well as scientific theory. Check

_Change in the Characteristics of Piano Tones under Different Concert
Pitches_
by
Tomoyasu Taguti and Osamu Tokuyama 
Konan University, Higashinada, Kobe, Japan

presented at

University of Edinburgh
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MUSICAL ACOUSTICS
19-22 August 1997:

"This paper reports an acoustical measurement and a listening experiment
on the tones of a piano where A4 is tuned to 436Hz(L:low),
442Hz(N:normal), and 445Hz(H:high)"

"Physically, . . . the inharmonicity of single piano strings . . .
becomes decreased as the pitch is raised. ([This] is implied in fact by
the formula of inharmonicity by Fletcher.)"

"the inharmonicities in cents were {20(L), 17(N), 10(H)} at the 10th
partial, and {45(L), 42(N), 35(H)} at the 20th partial."
