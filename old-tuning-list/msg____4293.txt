Subject: To Daniel Wolf, re Heinrich Schenker

From: Heinz Bohlen <Heinz.Bohlen@mptp.cpii.com>

I believe that I'm going to disappoint you. But I have to confess that I was
certainly not carried by Schenkerian spirit when I did my scale
constructions. The reason is simple: I didn't know about his work. I was
simply led by the idea that a harmonic scale results from the attempt to fill
the framework of a large consonant interval (for instance the octave)
with a chosen triad (for instance the Major) and its sub-intervals. The
smallest intervals created in this process are then used to fill the
voids and achieve approximate equidistance. This infill has practicality
for musical use as its reason. Alright, that sounds rather mechanistic, but
doesn't already the choice of the triad introduce tonality into this
process?
