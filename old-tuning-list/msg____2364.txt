Logic Audio (Mac) has a Audio to score feature that works very well. You
have access to detection parameters such as granulation, attack range,
smooth release, velocity threshold, time correction. After the translation
a window automatically opens with 3 different scores : notes, notes with
undetermined pitch, noises (percussion, fret buzz etc). It even translates
volume in velocity values, but doesn't take vibrato & slide, hence
microtonal intervals, into account.
Some standalone pitch to MIDI converters use pitch bend for that. But MIDI
doesn't give a standard ratio between PB values and cents. On some synths
the curve even varies from note to note.

Good luck

PS I like very much Middle Eastern music. Is the music youre trying to
translate in MIDI "microtonal" because of the Arabian scale quartertones,
or is the tuning orignal ? I'd like to hear it.

PPS is there such a thing as a "microtonality for the rest of us", or
whatever, CD compilation ? where can I find it ?
