   The pretty much accepted definition of precise just intonation - at least by
the readers of this list (more on that in the last paragraph) - is that all
notes must exactly match simple whole-number ratios.  Simplicity of the ratio,
and accuracy of the match are the ideals, not any particular limit, as with
5-limit Ptolemaic historical tunings.  

   To me, it seems likely that in the 13th century (if memory serves, that's
roughly when 5-based harmony began to be accepted as harmonious rather than
dissonant) anything but those specific ratios recognized at the time, would have
been considered inaccurate renditions of the accepted ones.  So, for example,
I'd almost bet money that even an exactly precise 9:7 third would have been
considered an off 5:4.  Time have changed though.  Every modern Just
Intonationalist I know of views 9:7 as an ideal in its own right.  

   Now an absolute, 100% exactly perfect match is almost always impossible, but
therein lies the distinction between inidealities in the performance, and an
accurate rendition of a tempered (nonjust) tuning.  

   So to present a degenerate example, consider a performance by instruments
tuned to equal-temperament and intended to produce 400-cent thirds, but wherein
the performers consistently produced exactly precise 5:4 thirds.  In my book
that would be failed performance in equal-temperament more than a successful
performance in just intonation, although by default, it would be that as well.

   My caveat to the "pretty much accepted definition", stems from the rather
puzzling definition presented in the otherwise quite authoritative Harvard
Dictionary of Music.  Best I recall, none of us on the list could make head nor
tail of that definition.  Feel free to check the archives for more on that.  And
a kind ambassador from the list sent (or at least attempted to send) a message
to the Harvard folks.  The message read, to summarize down to a single a word,
"huh?!".
