Wilson, one of the last of the pre-CAD drafting
virtuosi, clearly views his drawings as two
dimensional representations of multiple dimension
tonal spaces. In the famous _Connoisseur_ article
on Southern Cal. microtonalists, there is a nice
photo of Erv with some of his styrofoamball and
stick constructions, representing 3 dimensional
views.  =

It would be convenient if this were the case, but
in Europe, most 'modern' orchestras tune to 443 or
higher, and most early music groups use something
like 415.

You should also note that outside of the US, La Monte
Young uses 50 Hz as a basis for Dream House-related
works.

ITEM:

Schoenberg was a fiddle player.

By all accounts, he was not a virtuoso string player, just a very good
musician who could get by on the instrument in good company. He was
famously not a pianist, but insisted on having the pianists in his theory=

classes play the examples for him (''Mr. Stein...''). Both Lou Harrison a=
nd
John Cage told me that Schoenberg's harmony and counterpoint instruction
did not involve singing, just examples played on the piano. So much for t=
he
possibility of Just Intonation there.

I have previously posted excerpts from his letter to Yasser and some
remarks about the playing of violinist Rudolph Kolisch, who would begin
concerts by tuning all four strings to the piano in order to get the
temperament right, and whose quartet performances of the complete
Schoenberg quartet cycle remain the definitive intonational reading of th=
e
works in their attempt to temper the intervals.  =
