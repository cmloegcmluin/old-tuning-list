It's no problem.  I do it all the time with my Cd-r.  It's all part of the
standard, and any good Cd burning house should be able to do it.  And yes,
I do think this is a good idea (although I am not a part of the project),
since quite a bit of info could be fit on without taking up much music
time, if it was done carefully.

By regular I meant just that the units in the tessellation are all the
same.  Sometimes, the units themselves must be regular, which restricts us
to the Platonic and Kepler-Poinsot solids (of which only the cube fills
space), but I didn't mean that.

I had a strange desire for the lattice to contain only one shape, like what
is possible cubes or rectangular prisms.  If we make the 7-limit lattice
out of rh-dodecs, then it doesn't make sense any more (at least not to me).
 But you didn't mean to make the lattice out of rh-dodecs, you just thought
that the fact that the lattice defines a bunch of space-filling rh-dodecs
would pacify me.
