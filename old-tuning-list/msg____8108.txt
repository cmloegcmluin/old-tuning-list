It's a hoax. This fake AP story has been floating around the 
net for a few weeks this spring. I don't have the full 
story handy but it's full of factual inaccuracies to tip
us off that it's phony. 

Like John Adams quoting from his home in upstate NY?
I thought he was a SF Bay composer. Like Schoenberg, a Jew
is going to be a Nazi spy? I don't think so.
I even think that the hoaxter changed the nationality
of the person that shot Webern to clue us in.

If you don't believe me - do a Deja News search.

So much for Marc Shulgold's credibility...getting a story 
from a newsgroup with out following up on with AP!
