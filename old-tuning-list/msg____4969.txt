Which calls to mind our current topic in my music theory classes at 
school, Schenkerian analysis.  Acording to a very emotional "Schenkerian 
Structural Analasys" campaign, the picardy ending is a statement to the 
idea that minor sonorities are expressions of the fundamental- harmonicly 
speaking the ostensible root, and acousticly speaking the series 
fundamental.  To this point, it is further stated by Schenkerians that 
the major and minor sonorities are expressions of the same background 
structural information.  
  Now, to which degree does the Schenkerian I-V-I "Ursatz" analyzed out 
of "tonal" music afect choice of tuning?  Maybe someone more familiar 
with this kind of lingo can speak on that.  For instance, I want to know, 
does the V_I dominant-tonic cadence require a certain tuning for proper 
performance?
