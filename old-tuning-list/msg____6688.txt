Subject: 19 and melodic lemons

OK, so we know by now that you are a fan of 19-tet.

>Instead of attending to real issues, microtonalists have ...

Real? Are you seriously suggesting that the melodic difference limen
is the single most important aspect in choice of tuning? I can think of
three counterarguments...

(1) Melody is only one aspect of musical performance. Harmony is
also important, and you will agree that there are many tunings that
give more consonant (and more dissonant) harmonies than 19-tet.

(2) Even within melody, intonation is very variable among
instrumentalists. Often, this is intentional. The "flat" blues third may
not give a "new" melody, but it sure does give a new feeling to the
music. Such feelings are a *very* important aspect of many kinds of
music, and may be of any size that is perceptible, not just those sizes
that create "new" melodies.

(3) Even if we grant the melodic difference limen at 1/3 tone, this
says nothing about 19-tet per octave (or per stretched pseudo-octave
as you prefer). Indeed, the octave of a note is *not* a substitute for
that note in a melody. There is a paper (Diana Deutsch in Music
Perception, I believe) in which simple melodies such as Yankee
Doodle are played with the octaves of the notes scrambled up. Most
people cannot recognize the melodies, though they can follow them
once they are told what the melody is "supposed" to be. Thus melodic
concerns cannot be used to justify *any* scale based on the octave.

>I do _not_ believe it is possible to be inspired in 13-
or 20-tone equal; the lack of even the shadow of any possible musical
order is too great.

Humbug. Ask people who have composed in these scales (I am one,
and there are others, both on and off this list). Inspiration is
something that can strike at any time, in any tuning. The notion of an
"impoverished" scale is equally foolish. Different scales have
different stories to tell. Would you really have us all fall into line, all
playing with the newest greatest next best thing (in your opinion 19-
tet)?

>This is as far as the most charitable informed person can
go in the way of an open mind.

Perhaps this is some new notion of the word "charity" that I am
unfamiliar with.

Now I have to admit that I like 19-tet also. I have composed several
pieces (one was on the ill fated 19 for the 90's collection, another is
on my forthcoming Xentonality CD). In my opinion the best feature of
19-tet is how familiar everything is. Hence, yes Bob Lee, it might be
fun to tune a steel guitar that way. 19-tet makes a great bridge into
alternative tunings, and it may well be useful as a tool for "seducing"
people, for introducing them to the whole idea that non-12-tet music
exists. But let's not get carried away. I suggest, Greg Gibson, that you
try some of the other tunings that you have been so condescendingly
diss-ing for the past several weeks.
