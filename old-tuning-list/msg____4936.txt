Thanks, Neil, for the pointer to the "Guitar Shop" article! I had already 
skimmed the magazine in my quest for a new 12-tET guitar but didn't notice 
that tidbit. It is interesting that Jon is labelled a "progressive jazz" 
guitarist -- certainly "Crash Landing" may warrant the jazz label, while 
"Jesus Got a Gun" is hard rock, "Cow People" is country pop, and the Forever 
Bad Blues Band is none of the above (including "Bad" and "Blues"). What a 
versatile guy!

I found it interesting that Jon was originally inspired by seeing Ivor 
Darreg with a 22-tone guitar, but decided not to explore that tuning. I was 
partially inspired by hearing Jon Catler to get my guitar refretted, but, 
not knowing of the Darreg connection, I happened to chose 22-tET. Also, I 
recently saw a whole bunch of 22-tET guitars in an old issue of Experimental 
Musical Instruments, from which I was getting some tuning info for Manuel. I 
guess there really is nothing new, but it would be a tragedy if these ideas 
did not get explored afresh by each new generation.

I hope to be receiving my guitar neck shortly, and then I'll get to work 
learning some of my 22-tET keyboard (those stretches have really been 
hurting my hands) compositions on guitar. Also I plan on practicing lots of 
exercises that will help me learn to improvise over a harmonic texture that 
has 7-limit tetrads as basic units, which will include learning lots of 
good-sounding voicings for these chords. I already have a well-developed 
theory for a melodic structure from which this harmonic usage can be 
derived, but I'm going to keep my ears open for any new possibilities that 
strike me.
