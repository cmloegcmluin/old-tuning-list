Since I've spent so long unexpectedly in N. Mexico
and Arizona, I've been searching for data on
Native American music and tunings.  No such luck.

At best, I've found a few theses and dissertations
stashed away in library drawers, but they're only
a few, can't be checked out of the library, and
don't have tuning data anyway.  Hope you do better.
After my experience here, my guess is that New York 
libraries probably have the best collection of this
material.
