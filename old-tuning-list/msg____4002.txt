Subject: Justonic, Web, SAG

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

BEN: Justonic has a WEB page at http://www.justonic.com/. If you
need more specific information, email Rex Wyler at rex@justonic.com.

I must say I've had a far more positive experience surfing the
WEB than Brian has, but then I wasn't looking specifically for
"Microtonality Made Simple". Altavista has worked the best for
me, but it is necessary to take some thought as to what phrase(s)
or word(s) to search for and to use quotes, capitals, and/or semicolons
to limit the range, else one will get the union and not the
intersection of the topics.

The simplest strategy may be to use URL's from the Tuning List and
follow the links.

A minor correction to my last post: The venue of the SAG's December 7th
concert is called the Spruce Street Forum, 301 Spruce Street, 
San Diego, CA 92103 (619) 295-0301. The director is Bonnie Wright.  
The SSF shares space with the Porter Troupe Gallery which specializes 
in contemporary African-American art and artists.
