Subject: Gary Morrisson's SEJIC visit

From: World Harmony Project <sejic@afn.org>

The Southeast Just Intonation Center hosted a delightfull afternoon with
visiting composer/musician/theorist/instrument builder, Gary Morrison on
sunday Sept 15. Gary gave an informal demonstration of his new 88cet guitar,
played recordings and discussed matters of tuning, composition and
instrument building with an enthusiastic group of SEJIC residents and
visitors. Our distinguished visitor also had time to see, hear and play the
instruments in our studio, and participate in a home-cooked vegetarian
Dinner.
	All of us at SEJIC enjoyed the visit thoroughly and look forward to
future meetings with Gary and others, who would like to share their
knowledge with us.
