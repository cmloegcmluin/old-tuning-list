Subject: harmonic distortion

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

Now & then discussion arises on how integer-multiple overtones arise in
nature. Perfect strings, of course. But also various types of distortion. 

The May 1997 issue of IEEE Spectrum has an article "Power electronics'
polluting effects", by R. Redl, P. Tenti, and J. D. Van Wyk. Several charts
and graphs showing the integer-multiple overtones that are generated by the
various devices people plug into the power distribution grid - fluorescent
lights, color TV's, etc.   

Reminds me a bit of how various planetary orbits get synched up in
phase-locked relationships.
