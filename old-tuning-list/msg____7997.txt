   Tom Stone originally called his interchangeable-fretboard company
"Intonation Systems" and later changed it to "Novatone".  When Novatone
cratered, Mark Rankin took over some of the remnants of the company and
started selling interchangeable fretboards more or less as kits.

   Best I've been able tell though, Mark doesn't try to make a living off
it.  It's more of a spare-time hobby that more or less breaks even.

   I see what appear to be two similar patent numbers on my fingerboards:
4132143 and 4132149.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of those two numbers
is just a misprint (or that I'm misreading it).
