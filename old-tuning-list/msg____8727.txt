Not necessarily.  Most synthesized waveforms in commercial synthesizers are
still based upon the phase accumulator oscillator just like sample playback
machines.  A waveform is read from a table and the phase increment adjusted
to change pitch.  It is the fractional part of the phase accumulator that
determines the pitch resolution.  It's a matter of how the oscillators are
implemented, and the current crop of of pseudo-analog synthesis really don't
provide any details on this.  Certainly the older Yamaha FM, Casio PM and
Kawai Additive synths have similar pitch limitations to the sample playback
machines.
