Well, I think Dan's point is that Harrison's and Lucy's pi-based
definition has nebulous value to many microtonalists, except as a close
approximation to Erv Wilson's meta-meantone tuning.  It's easy to imagine -
perhaps completely falsely - Harrison or Lucy thinking, "1/3 octave is just
too sharp for a major third.  Hey I know, I'll use 1/pi instead!  Pi's a
magic number!"

   I personally am prone to go one step further:  to attribute only limited
significance to Erv's meta-meantone definition as well, because,
1.  Only occasionally do major triads get voiced as 4:5:6 approximations
with 
    no octave displacements or doubling, 
2.  At least in the definition alone, doesn't address how the harmonics of 
    those tones beat against each other, and
3.  In most musical contexts, objective tones pretty much drown out
difference 
    tones anyway.  I certainly do acknowledge a handful of important 
    exceptions, like solo duets on high-pitched instruments, but those are,
in
    the big musical picture, exceptions.  
Perhaps I'd change that opinion after working out the math of how
beat-frequencies are affected by harmonics, octave displacement, and
doubling.  

   But as I've said before, I certainly don't want my comments here to
discourage anybody from experimenting with LucyTuning.  In my limited
experimentation with it, it struck me as perfectly reasonable and usable
tuning.
