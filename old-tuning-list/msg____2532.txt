Subject: Tibetan Buddhist chant

From: Judith.Parkinson@anu.edu.au (Judith Parkinson)

I have recently completed a thesis on the pedagogy of acoustically pure
intonation in a cappella vocal music which also includes a history of
tuning as it relates to vocal music. I am now interested to know more about
non-western music, specifically the role of chant in religious ritual, and
the role in the scheme of things of particular tuning systems. For example
the psycho-physical effects of Tibetan Gyuto chant, other Tantric
chanting.From what I understand although they chant in overtones (ala Tuva
music, and adapted from those traditions, which I have also heard) do they
have similar concepts about 'singing in tune'? I know there is a lot of
precise knowledge about sound-vibration-energy in Buddhist tantrism. Also
in Indian religious systems. If anyone has any information on this I would
appreciate it.Anyone know the email address (or snail mail) of Ter
Ellingson who has done a thesis on Tibetan ritual music?
