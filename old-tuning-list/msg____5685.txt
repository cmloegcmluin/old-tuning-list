I don't know about the structure of the ear, but that is an interesting
idea.  However I do believe that in nature there are definite
frequencies at ratios near to but not exactly equal to 2.

One particularly interesting example is found in the periods of
revolution of 3 of the 4 Galilean satellites of Jupiter.  They are all
being repelled by the action of tidal forces, with the strongest action
on the innermost.  However as they get near to exact 1:2 ratios it sets
up a strong resonance which forces the next outer one away from an exact
1:2 resonance.  The result is as follows:

Jupiter Satellite       I               II              III

Period (days)       1.76913780      3.55118108      7.15455312
Frequency (nHz)     6542.21173      3259.21822      1617.72145

                             I - 2xII       II - 2xIII
Beat frequency (nHz)         23.77530        23.77531

Ratio II/beat                137.0842        137.0841

The interesting thing is that not only are the beats between each
adjacent pair of satellites the same, but the ratio of these to the
middle satellite period of 137.0841 is very similar to a number found in
atomic physics called the fine structure constant which is 1/137.0360.

The two ratios II/I and III/II are 1206.3 and 1212.7 cents respectively.
It rather seems that nature likes to operate at a little distance from
exact resonance.
