Subject: Re: Danielou, Makeig, & Wolf in "Interval"

From: monz@juno.com

Since the names Alain Daniilou, Scott Makeig, and
Daniel Wolf have all popped up here recently in the
discussion of prime affects, I thought I'd mention
that here at Sonic Arts we still have several copies
available of "Interval", vol. 2 no.4, with the
articles "Theory of Interval Affect, part 3" by
Makeig and Wolf's own "Dan Wolf: Microtonal Composer".

Jonathan Glasier is out of town right now, so I can't
double-check the prices, but according to the Interval
website, they're $2 in the US and $4 foreign, plus
shipping costs.  Visit the "Interval" website for more
info:

Makeig's article touches on several of the issues
we've talked about here in the TD lately.  This issue
dates from 1980.
