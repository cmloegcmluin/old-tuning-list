Subject: Split Key CD  (was Enharmonics)

Anyone really interested in split-keyed intruments and/or
the resulting sound would like the CD
"Il cimbalo cromatico napoletano"  Nuova Era 7177 [I think
the catalogue # is correct].

Good notes about split-keyed instruments. The
works were recorded in several takes with
an instrument retuned to differentiate
sharps from flats.

KALA XPISTOYGENNA,
ran

last word I believe: The Greeks [Orthodox] as far back as they can
remember do say pisteuo [pistevo] "I believe".  Next week I'll have the
word for harpsichord in Greek, for what it is worth.
