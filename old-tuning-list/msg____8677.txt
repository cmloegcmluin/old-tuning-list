Subject: back in action

From: Neil Haverstick <stick@uswest.net>

Yikes...I hope this is for good this time...a zillion thanks to Starrett
for his unselfish help, both technically and emotionally, in getting
back online. And Morrison spelled things out real well about the forum
CD...I do, indeed, have to assemble them, so please be patient...next in
line are Loffink, Alves, and Burt...I'll get them out as soon as
possible. I sent one to Keyboard mag, and a few other writers as
well...hopefully, some of you will have some creative ideas as to where
to place them. I hope for some good reviews, and some airplay...I have a
number of thoughts about the project, but will wait until everyone has
their copies before I chat about it. If anyone emailed me recently, I am
afraid that the messages were lost, so try again if you need to
chat...see you...Hstick
