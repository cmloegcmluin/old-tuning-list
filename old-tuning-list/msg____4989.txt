Robert, on arriving at your pages I had a feeling of deju vu.
Your three coloured waves logo with periods in the ratio 2:3:5 is quite
similar to one on my pages.  The problem with which you are dealing,
that of working out the exact correct frequency of every note in any
composition, is the same one that I address in my AJI pages at
http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm

Robert, congratulations on a nice clear presentation.

In your pages you say:

Right!  I have considered a number of options for this and believe that
in general the best solution is one based on a sort of information
theory idea.  The following may be a bit heavy, but once grasped can be
seen as a powerful tool.

To explain this idea, consider that each chord played has notes related
by ratios to the tonic.  Suppose that these ratios for a particular
chord are 5/4, 15/8, 3/1.  Then it is necessary to find the LCM (lowest
common multiple) of the numerators and divisors which are 15 and 8.  My
system then consists of counting demerit points for the factors of these
two numbers.  We have 2^3 and 3^1*5^1 and so must score demerits by
weighting the value for the indices here.  Generally ratios of 2 are
most acceptable and then 3 and then 5 etc.  My preferred formula for
demerits is in proportion to p*ln(p) so that if 2 is set as unity each 3
and 5 will score 2.4 and 5.8 respectively.  In that case 8 and 15 will
score 3 and 2.4+5.8 for a total of 11.2 demerits.  If there is a better
way to "read" the chord then it will score less.

Some intervals such as a minor sixth may be interpreted as 7/4, 16/9 or
9/8 depending on circumstances.  The one that minimises the demerits is
to be considered better because it is more simply related to the other
notes present or even previously played.

BTW, there is a missing graphic on one of your pages.  Unfortunately I
just pressed the wrong key and lost everything including the reference.
