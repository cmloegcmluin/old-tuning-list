From: Eduardo Sabat <esabat@adinet.com.uy>

In November, 1997 Jan williams and his wife came to Montevideo.
Jan Williams is Professor Emeritus in the University at Buffalo.

 He gave a two week course of percution in our Escuela Universitaria de
Musica and in 13 Nov. he conducted a concert in our pricipal cultural
theatre, the Sala Faz Ferreira.=20

 The concert team was formed by students of the E,U.M. having to Jorge
Camiruaga as Director.

 They played pieces of John Cage, Theo Loevendie, Leo Masliah and Richard
Trythall.

 For me it was a great experience, at the finish of the concert I resumed
the work as =B4=B4It was absolutely necessary to come=B4=B4.

 Next day I had the honour and the pleasure to received them in my home.
 In that moment Johannes Stenger played both acoustic and electric Dinarra.
