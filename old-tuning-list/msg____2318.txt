       Here Comes Everybody:  The Music, Poetry, and Art of John Cage

               An Interdisciplinary Conference and Festival on
              Cage's Contributions to Twentieth Century Culture

               Presented by the Mills College Music Department
                    and the Center for Contemporary Music


A CONCERT SERIES
     devoted to Cage's music, an exhibition of Cage's art in the Mills
     College Art Gallery, and films about Cage.

THE CONCERT SERIES INCLUDES
     works from the entire range of Cage's creative output, from his 
early works for percussion ensemble and prepared piano, to several works 
written just before his death. Members of the Center for Contemporary 
Music perform live electronic works from Cage's first experiments with 
this medium to several newer compositions. Guest artists include Marianne 
Amacher, The Hub, Joseph Kubera, and Gordon Mumma.

AN EXCLUSIVE SCREENING
     of One11 and 103, Cage's extraordinary collaboration with filmmaker 
Peter Lohner, and From Zero, four films about Cage by Andrew Culver and 
Frank Scheffer, reveal another aspect of Cage's artistic accomplishments.


The Concert series is just the live music aspect of this conference event.
