My goodness. This bit of self-justification was a trifle long even
by Brian's standards. In light of his obvious debt to the Bard in his
"But Brutus says I am a raving crank, and Brutus is an honorable man"
motif, I'm put in mind of a slightly different quotation from our literary
canon:

"Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much."

Speaking of canons (loose and otherwise), I'm surprised that nobody
said anything about Brian's recent and somewhat hamfisted analysis
of the notion of canons (musical and literary and otherwise). I guess
I'll throw something together which might provide a slightly more
graduated approach to the notion of canon studies; at the very least, it'll
be a good topic for dinner conversation with my beloved....

With regards,
Gregory

Another excellent composer of choral music in just intonation is Douglas 
Leedy. He lives up on the Oregon coast and doesn't have email, but I have
a mailing address for him if anyone wants to contact him directly.

There may be other choral composers listed in the xenharmonic diskography
in the Mills ftp site.
