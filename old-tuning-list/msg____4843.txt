The node of a vibrating string and the edge of a fret 
effectively resolve to points, no matter the width
of the finger used to dampen the string or the 
thickness of the fret. Are you saying that these 
points always coincide?

You're missing the contradiction. You said all 
ghosttones follow a series of fourths and fifths. 
An octave doesn't occur in such a series. Please 
explain this contradiction.

So you're saying that these first few important
ghosttones are rational intervals (2.000, 4.000, etc.)?

Will you describe this procedure?
