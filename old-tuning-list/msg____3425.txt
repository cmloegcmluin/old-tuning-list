Anyone heard the German (?) guitarist Hans Reichel? He plays a variety of
altered guitars, including multiply-bridged instruments. A non-musician
friend of mine bought his album "Flight Of The Rare Bird Ymir" just because
he liked the title (and it was only 50p in a car boot sale). At the time,
I'd heard nothing like it and was amazed how so much clicking, rattling,
clanking and twanging could sound so beautifully expressive. 

Does anyone know if he's still active?
