Nice analogy. JI intervals are like guide buoys. They are the way 
we find our way around hearing-space. That means we can identify 
and enjoy other intervals; the fact that some singers
can sing 12tet proves that. I'm repeating an earlier post, but 
I like to describe slightly detuned just intervals as an
example of deviation from a gestalt, which is a basic device 
of all arts. People like a little beating and phasing sometimes.
I do think there's a place for music which jumps directly from 
buoy to buoy though, especially nowadays when most of the
music you hear is full of near misses.
