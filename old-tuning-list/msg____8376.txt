Will this (or other) software allow me to take input from a simple 
(several years old Casio) MIDI keyboard and play it in alternative 
temperaments (meantone, Vallotti, etc. etc.)?  

I know essentially nothing about Midi and music software, apart from 
using a notation program which has  midi input/output. But would like to
learn some time.  Pointers to sources of information would be welcome.
