Haverstick here...first, if anyone can help me on this topic, I would 
greatly appreciate it. A while back, I sent a DAT tape of Ivor Darreg's 
guitar Prelude to McLaren to be included on the "19 for the '90's" 
project. My next CD is going to be all acoustic (19 and 34 eq), and I 
would like to have Ivor's piece on there...I've written McLaren to see 
about getting the Dat back, because I do not have the time to relearn the 
Prelude again, but have not heard from him. If a list member can help to 
locate McLaren, and see about this DAT getting back to me, I would be in 
your debt. 

The old saw about certain music being appropriate or inappropriate on 
different axes is a discussion without any resolution, other than 
strictly personal opinion. Myself, I feel that it is a total non issue. I 
really enjoy hearing other interpretations of music, the more the 
merrier. Music does not "belong" to any one person...once created, it 
should be freely enjoyed, and if this means reinterpreted, fine with me 
(sure, copyrights ensure that those who created the work get their 
financial due, which is honorable). We are only the channel; music comes 
from beyond this physical realm, and is a gift and blessing for those to 
whom the gift is given...Hstick
