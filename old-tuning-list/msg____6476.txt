As far as listening to one's own music...absolutely. What could
possibly be wrong with that? Once it is created, it is either good or
bad, just like anyone else's stuff. To be totally honest when you listen
to it is the issue, to me. If it's good, enjoy it...if it's not so good,
admit it, and then learn from it and fix it. I have been composing for
almost 30 years, and I like some of my stuff more than I do other works.
Are the ones I like good music? That's a mighty subjective experience;
even if a piece is "good" technically, say, and shows a mastery of one's
instrument, does that mean the feeling level is profound? Or, that
someone else will even feel it the same way you did? In Coltrane's
biography, there are quotes about his music from 2 heavy duty folks which
are presented right next to each other...the 2 people feel exactly
opposite about Coltrane's music...that's what I mean.
    I respect some people's music that I might not necessarily like to
listen to...Mozart is a good example. No doubt he was a great genius, but
much of his music does absolutely nothing for me. To find good music that
you also like is wonderful...if your own creations happen to be high
quality, I say accept it as a gift, and be grateful that, for some
reason, this marvelous art of music expresses itself through your
voice...Hstick
