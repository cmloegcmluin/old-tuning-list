That makes sense to me--but I'd hate to go against the hands-on
experience of a tuner.  Ed Foote, what say you?  (IIRC, Ed was the tuner
on the list who was using unequal temperaments on modern pianos, yes?)

As I recall, the greater harmonicity that results from greater string
tension is the reason that historical keyboard instruments are scaled so
that the strings are very near their breaking stress, regardless of the
metal used.  Occasionally we have discussions on the Harpsichord list
about this.  Intuitively, the phenomenon can be explained this way: as
string tension increases, the component of the restoring force in the
vibration caused by string tension (ideal-stringlike behavior)
increases, becoming greater in relation to the component caused by
string stiffness (bar-like behavior), which remains constant--and ideal
strings vibrate harmonically while bars do not.
