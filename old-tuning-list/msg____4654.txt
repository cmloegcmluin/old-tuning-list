Subject: RE: Arabic Tuning

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

To Graham Breed (2nd attempt, sorry if it appears twice)

Helmholtz devotes a number of pages to Arabic and Persian scales in
"On the sensations of tone".
The scales you gave were catalogued by Safi al-Din (Bagdad, 13th century).
They are among the twelve main maqams that he described.
To answer your second question, yes they are from a reliable source.
A good one is
  Liberty Manik: Das arabische Tonsystem im Mittelalter. PhD diss. Freie
  Univ. Berlin, 1969. E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1969, 140 pages.
They are also in my list of modes which also contains a few modern Arabic
scales: ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/modename.txt .
A good introductory source for answers to your other questions is
  Habib Hassan Touma: Musik der Araber. English translation by Laurie
  Schwartz: The music of the Arabs, Amadeus Press, Portland, 1996, 238 pages.
Modern tunings, at least in Turkey, often use a subset of 53-tET.
They also use an interval unit of 1060 parts to the octave (1/20 of a 
53-tone comma) there, but I don't know what its name is. Subsets of
24-tET are also used, in more popular music.
As an interesting aside: the word maqam is a cognate of the Jewish nickname
for Amsterdam: Mokum. Its meaning is "the place", or so I'm told.
