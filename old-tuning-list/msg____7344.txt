Subject: comma/error

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Sorry for the late response, but my email toasted and is now back in 
the groove. A while back, Morrison was chatting about the comma 
encountered after a 12 note spiral of pure 5ths, which is a well known 
phenomenon. As most theorists have done, he called this comma an "error" 
(I've also seen it called an "anomaly"). However, I don't think "error" 
is an appropriate name for this occurance, since it is a natural feature 
of the spiral of 5ths...it IS the way it is, so how can it be an "error," 
which implies a deviation from the way it "should" be? To me, that which 
is natural is the norm...seems to me an "error" would be a departure from 
the natural...Hstick
