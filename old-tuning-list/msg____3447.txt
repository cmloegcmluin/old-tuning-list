Subject: Re: Partch, the idealist that remains...

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

"Make something up...erroneous reporting" ?

I know Jon is sincere is his challenge to uphold Partch "attitude" as he 
sees it.  Those on the list that have heard my Partch performances know 
that the only substitution I use is the synthesizer for the 
Chromolodeon.  While the sweat and muscle of the Chromo is romantic
elder Partchians, the synth allows for necessary production of the many 
written notes on the scores.  

Does this matter - that the notes are heard and are balanced with the 
others in the group?  Well, the poor amplification used in Philly would 
seem to equate all the instruments on an electric level.  And there was 
no synth through much of Partch's life, so Partch might well have evolved 
towards it, just as moved towards percussion and away from poorly built 
guitars.

To fabricate my experiences at the Philly concert would be silly since so 
many were there.  To my eyes, the instruments were not visible...and they 
never moved.  Jon states he was "almost" on eye level with the second 
story.  The view from the audience was a different perspective.  Is this, 
or is the following concert version in Lincoln Center merely the 
exceptions that prove the rule?  Was the rush to Lincoln Center an 
expedience that Danlee could not turn down?

Having read as much of the material produced by Partch as just about 
anyone, I came to different conclusions, buttressed by post-Partch 
attitudes and behavior.  It may be convenient to dismiss early errors of 
judgement in what should be allowable for Partch performances, but to me 
these are hipocritical.  A wise man once said "Your actions speak so 
loudly that I can't hear what you are saying."  BTW, haven't performed 
Partch works in over 2 years...no rush.
