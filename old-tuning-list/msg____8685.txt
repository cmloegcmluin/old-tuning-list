Things to do today:

 1) Explore and resolve the inherent difficulties encountered whenever human
contrivance  meets - and attempts to bond with - the inscrutable laws of
nature. 

2) Chase through canonical instructions designed to trigger imitative gestures
 modeled after the phenomenon of shape-shifting periodic wave relationships
observed in the physical world. 

3) Pit the best of faithful intentions - that of achieving a sustainable state
of  perfection -  against an overwhelming hierarchical gravity which always
has the last disappointing word.

4) Make change. Try again.
