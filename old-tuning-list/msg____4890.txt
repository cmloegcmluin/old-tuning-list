TO WHOM IT CONCERNS

My name is Tim Lehane and I work with RTE national radio for Ireland.
My particular programme MONDAY 7.02  has recently won a prestigious
national award for quality broadcasting, and as a result we have
revamped and our new programme is called ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER SPACE.
Our programmes are rebroadcast on satellite and via cable to Europe,
America and Australia. We are also rebroadcast over local radio
stations in these continents, who take all or selected parts of our
programming. We are also doing some broadcasts on the internet
http://www.rte.ie/

Our programme has a particular audio driven aspect to it., we feature
all kinds of strange and different things. To date we have looked at
an extremely broad range of experimental music, speech, sounds, audio,
from all over the world. Maybe you have unusual items of interest to
us, or are a collector of the ususual, old radio recordings, early
audio recordings, recordings of the countryside, or train stations,
whatever is different, mainstream or not, we are interested.

Past contributors have received excellent reaction, and work out of
having their material featured on our programme. We are interested in
using anything, that  remotely fits into that category, so do post it
to the address below, in any form cassette, DAT, mini disc, CD,
though no audio files through the internet please.

IMPT: Since initial posting, we have been getting e-Mails asking us
what address to send it to, what format is acceptable, and "I do x
type of work, would you be interested in me sending that to you"  YES
we will  feature almost all things sent to us, so just send it on. The
full ADRESS is given above and below.   Finally except for internet
audio files, ALL AUDIO FORMATS are acceptable.

So send it on, and we will contact you shortly, looking forward to
hearing your material, best wishes.
Please send your material on now to this postal address above.

                                        Yours Sincerely
