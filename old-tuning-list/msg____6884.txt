MOS:

Thank you, John Chalmers for the explanation of MOS scales.  I had
beat my head for a couple of hours trying to figure it out, but the
only part I had reliably was the case of one of the A & B being 0.
Guess I should add an "Advanced Math for Dummies Who Used to Sort of
Know a Bit" book to my shopping list. ;-)

Hexany:

I'm also finding the articles on the stellated hexany fascinating --
now I know what "stellation" is!  Cool. And, since I recently reglued
the welding rods on my Temporary Guitar (no TM :) to 31, looks like
I'll have something [else!] to amuse myself with over the holiday.

Detwelveulate in '98:

Well, the basement band I jammed with has been dissolved for a few
months, and it doesn't look like we'll be back together any time
soon.  On top of that, I've been really absorbed with learning my way
around 22tet lately as well.  So...

Monday night I ordered a new ebony fingerboard and a couple lengths of
fretwire from LMI, and I'm planning on redoing my fretted bass in 22,
complete with shiny new gold dots, at which point (having reengineered
my keyboard as described earlier) I will have NO remaining 12tet
instruments!  That wasn't a specific goal, mind you, but I think I've
played that bass but once since the band stopped jamming, and while
not often, there are some times when the fretted sound is what I'm
after. Besides, I hated thinking of it sitting upstairs all alone all
the time -- basses need to be loved, too. ;-)

Kind of scary, actually, pulling up the last tent stake and packing
into the uncharted hills, but I'm looking forward to it.  I guess if
we get back together to do 12 music [I'm really hoping to get someone
else into 22 so we can jam that way!], I'll do what I've been doing
for a while now anyhow -- grab the fretless and fake it! :-) ;-) :-)

Happy New Year, everyone!!!

Steve
