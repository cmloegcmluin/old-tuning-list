I would contend that in a homophonic style, any note in the scale may appear 
(if only in passing) with any chord, and this can create a tritone unless 
the chord is the tonic chord of either the major or minor mode. Hence the 
"resolution" of interest is where both voices move. The Mixolydian and 
Dorian modes are common in jazz, where the tritone blends with the tonic 
triad to form approximate 7-limit tetrads (often with added notes). The 
behavior of the tritone here is more "static" as opposed to its "dynamic" 
behavior in the major and minor modes (the harmonic minor has two dynamic 
tritones). No, this has nothing to do with "dynamic just intonation."

Brian -- I tried to include all the world music tuning systems I was 
acquainted with (not many) in my proposed curriculum, and would certainly 
think well over 5 hours could be devoted to those and others without 
changing the outline. (I conceived it as a 30-, not 15-, hour course). The 
history and diversity of tuning theory is of course very interesting, but 
would be outside the scope of this course; ideas such as 31-tet and JI have 
arisen again and again from many highly incompatible theories and so should 
be included despite their "theoretical" nature. As long as you're mentioning 
55-tet (1/6-comma meantone), don't forget 43-tet (1/5-comma meantone), which 
was also discussed in the 18th century, I believe. I'm not aware of 34 
having been discussed in the Renaissance, but 53 was (Mercator was 16th 
century?) so 34 could have been. As for non-octave scales, etc., the field 
at this point has very little that can be "taught" as "this is the way it 
is," but certainly the intent of putting it last is to say, "This is the 
avant garde, you can throw away the presumptions of all the previous lessons 
if you want to." Those interested can use the remaining free-form weeks to 
explore these ideas if they wish, and go on to take an advanced course in 
the subject taught by Prof. McLaren. :)

I'd add
4. Maximal evenness (this works only in 12-tet and 19-tet)
5. Unique interval vector (this only works in 12-tet); Balzano liked this 
one.
6-infinity. Lots of other 12-tet set theory garbage; Xenakis has some 
construction in the appendix of his book "Formalized Music" that looks more 
complicated than just saying what all the notes are!

But this scale has only two major triads, so by your definition of a major 
scale, it is not a satisfactory tuning for the major-minor system. Or am I 
missing something?
