I am not in the league of creating a CD (I am just an academic, and
not even a musical one to boot) but there is one part of Gary's
message which worries me -- I have said this before to individuals but
not publically.

I have a piece of (what I call) music which took me many times of
listening before I decided that I like it.  I really do, and I play it
sometimes in the privacy of my office for the delightful close pitched
melodic fragments.  I am not asking you to like it, but to worry about
the effect of not liking it until I had played it tens of times.
There is a problem with many works I hear, that they are created to be
"catchy" as otherwise they will never be played again.  On the other
hand there are works which I dimmly remember, which I would like to
hear over again, but I cannot as they did not have a sufficient
gimick, so they are lost (at least to me).

I do not know either CD to which Gary refers, but I have doubts as to
whether he is right.  I can remember thinking Wagner was a total bore
(but now I am happy to sit through a cycle), and thinking that Haydn
was dull, and I will not repeat my reaction to JSBach...  In those
cases others had decided on the quality over the years, and I had
further opportunities.  In the case of much new music the need for a
catchy tune seems of greater importance than depth.

Oh well!  Back to programming.
