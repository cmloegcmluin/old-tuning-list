It is interesting that you began with a question about Arabic music.
Arabic modes use neutral seconds (which bisect minor thirds) and neutral
thirds (which bisect perfect fifths) which are not present in 19-equal.
So much for studying "all the modes melodically distinct to the ear!"
Septimal intervals, the next logical step in consonance after the
5-limit intervals in triads, are far better represented in 31-equal than
19-equal. If you really believe that the 31-equal dieses are too small
for use in melody, no one will force you to use them! Even avoiding
them, you will have more melodic variety than in 19-equal, plus you will
get much better 7-limit harmonies, far better 11-limit harmonies, and
even those Arabic modes (just add 1 to the size of each of the
heptatonic steps in an Arabic scale in 24-equal and you get a pretty
good 31-equal approximation).

22-equal, far from being worthless, has occupied me for the last six
years; see my paper at
http:/www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html under "Notes on
Microtonality." Worthless for diatonicism, maybe; for escaping the
diatonic hegemony, it may be our only hope. In a rare moment of
compositional inspiration, I wrote a piece where the top voice moves
down through 20 of the 22 tones. You can hear this on the Tuning-List
Tape. Despite the 54.5 cent steps, I can sing this melody in the shower
(but only if I clearly imagine the harmony).

>>C   D   E   F   G   Ab   Bb   C
>>C   Db   E   F   Gb   A   Bb   C
>>C   D   E   F   G#   A   B   C
