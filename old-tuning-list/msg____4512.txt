Subject: Euler question

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

To quote from R. Rasch's Fokker book:
"Fokker's way of describing genera was based on the approach of
Leonhard Euler in _Tentamen novae theoriae musicae_ (St. Petersburg,
1739). Because of this, Fokker's genera are often called 'Euler genera'.
However, since the harmonic seventh plays an important role in Fokker's
genera, while it was rejected for practical use by Euler, it is better
to see Fokker's theory of genera as an extension of Euler's and to
call the resulting genera _Euler-Fokker genera_."

> If 2 is the largest exponent, second-degree would make sense as a label;

Not quite, the degree is the sum of the exponents. For example,
Genus [33557] (chromatico-enharmonicum) is of the fifth degree. This one
has 3 x 3 x 2 18 notes.
