Subject: Tape Swap Copies

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

For those of you that have not contributed to the Swap but would like a copy
of the Tape- I will be sending the Master Tape to Gary Morrison in a week or
so as he has graciously offered to make copies for those interested in copies.

I should remind those interested in receiving a tape that postage due for all
materials that will be sent to you comes to at least $1.24. And that you need
to send a _90 Minute_ tape and that you need to enclose a padded envelope with
the correct postage on it. For whatever reason about half of the participants
either did not send me tapes, envelopes or postage. Please help Gary out on
this end.

In anycase, for those that I have sent tapes out to- I did not have time to
check the tapes individually. My Dat machine can on rare occassion not
align properly. If your tape is distorted in some manner please e-mail me and
I will send you another one gratis and please accept my apologies.
