'' Assuming that he is correct (I have no reason to doubt him on this), and the fashion moved from meantone into well temperaments, and eventually 12tET, I wonder why meantone tunings were abandoned.''

My post clearly did not say this, but rather that the well temperaments
were an abandoned cul-de-sac within a generally meantone era, and that the
repertoire associated with the well temperaments had certain attributes
that were not taken up by the immediately following generations of
composers, who were apparently satisfied with the tonal resources of
meantone (whether or not they actually used meantone is another question!).
From my posting, I wanted to suggest that 12tet was not an historicallyconsequent development out of the well temperaments, but rather a later
development directly out of meantone, and reflecting different musical
priorities than those which gave rise to the well temperaments.  Lucy also writes:

''The difficulty of quickly retuning meantones would have severely
restricted the harmonic possibilities, yet well temperaments immediately offered keyboard players both tuning and intervallic novelties, in different keys.''

Which is not quite right. Tuning meantone and Werckmeister III or
Kirnberger III involve setting _exactly_ the same tempered series, and then
tuning series of just intervals - in meantone, a series of 5/4 thirds, inthe well temperaments, a series of 3/2 fifths. Therefore there is no
question of the speed of retuning here. Without retuning, the well
temperaments offer 12 usable key signatures, but if the target is
''intervallic novelties'' then using more than then the 6 ''in tune''
signatures in meantone will certainly greater novelty of the sort. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
