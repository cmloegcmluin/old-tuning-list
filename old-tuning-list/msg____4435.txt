Subject: pure or just

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick here...Morrison's comments on correct terminology are right
on...that's why "just" has no meaning for me as applied to
tunings...pure, as I use it, means primal, unaltered, perfect...which is
exactly what the notes in the harmonic series are...am I missing
something?  Also, where is Danielou missing the boat as regards his
interpretation of Indian music? Again, who really knows? Anybody on this
forum? Because I think the points raised lately concerning the
connection between tunings, music, and larger "Metaphysical" issues are
very important, and should be pursued. In a similar vein, the Martians
in Mars Attacks were destroyed by Slim Whitman's music...is this is
what's meant by Shiva the Destroyer?   Hstick
