   Well....  Every careful study I've heard of tuning in real musical
practice on indefinite-pitched instruments, concludes that performers
rarely follow any one single tuning formula accurately and consistently.
Well-known formulas, like 5:4 major thirds for example, certainly do get
used in spots though.

   The conventional string-player's wisdom - whether true or not - is that
people's ears home in on the highest pitch in a vibrato pattern.
