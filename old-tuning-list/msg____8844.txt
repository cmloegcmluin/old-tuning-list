Subject: Re: microtonal dictionary

From: John Starrett <jstarret@math.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Yes, Joe, it was I who stated the intention to compile a 
microtonal dictionary. Yours is further along than mine, so I am temporarily 
withdrawing mine from my web page in order to concentrate on my knot 
theory and nonstandard analysis dictionaries. I expect that with the 
expansion of the Sonic Arts website, and McLaren's Ivor Darreg site, we 
will have a great microtonal resource. By the way, there is finally a Don 
Ellis website (well, info sheet) at 
http://www.mbnet.mb.ca/~mcgonig/donellis.html
For those of you who don't remember, Don Ellis was a big band leader who 
played quarter tone trumpet.
