This is not surprising: 16th-19th century polyphony quite intentionally 
avoided parallel seconds, though parallel thirds and sixths are often found. 
In the 13th century thirds were not yet consonant, and Pythagorean thirds 
still sound bad to me today. The general rule is, dissonances must resolve 
by contrary (or at least oblique) motion to a consonance, since progressing 
in parallel would lead to another dissonance!
