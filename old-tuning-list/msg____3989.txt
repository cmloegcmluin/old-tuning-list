Subject: Partch's antecedents

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

Daniel Wolf's relevant and interesting remarks about
Partch's antecedents do seem to assume that one
can create something original only from traditional
materials.

Yet many of us working during the 60s and 70s developed
our work from what "came naturally," trying even
consciously to ignore received theories, especially in music.
Partch had stated in the generation before ours
that this was just what he was trying to do.

I think Partch's "harmonic complexity" may have
originated genuinely within himself.  Perhaps he accepted as
musical terms some ideas that had already become current
in the theater, through the work of Artaud et al.
