Subject: A pointer to an array of the wrong people....

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

Silly me! I'm going on about the New  Complexity and I forget to
paste in the list of recording pointers. I plead the pressure of my
day job combined with my existence as a toady of High Culture :-)

___
Brian Ferneyhough
String Quartets 2 & 3 (Montaigne 789002)
Arditti Quartet

Michael Finnisy

Catana/Contrenanze/String Trio (Etcetera KTC1096)

Piano Music (NMC NMCD002)

James Dillon

Ignes Noster/Helle Nacht (Montaigne 782038)
BBC Symphony Orchestra

Chamber Music (Montaigne 782037)
And it's *Accroche* rather than the Arditti. I was thinking
instead of a piece for solo violin that James has on a solo
recital disc of violin (there's a Ferneyhough on it, too)

The only Chris Dench I can think of offhand is from a Vox
Australis disc "The Flute Ascendant". It includes Dench's "Sulle
Scale Della Fenice" and a piece by Ferneyhough and Dillon. It's a
whole disc of really knotty solo flute pieces.

I hope this helps.

With regards,
Gregory

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
