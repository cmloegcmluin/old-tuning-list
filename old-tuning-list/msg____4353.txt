Subject: Stockhausen and Partch

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

I have been asked off-list to document the connection between Partch´s
Diamond and the tuning of Stockhausen's _Sternklang_. 

That the _Sternklang_ tuning is a subset of the Partch diamond is self
evident.

Stockhausen will admit to no direct influences on his work (the same goes
for the relationship between _Stimmung_ and La Monte Young's _Tortoise_
pieces).

However, these three points of contact suggest more familiarity with Partch
on the part of Stockhausen: (1) Stockhausen's residency at UCDavis, where
Larry Austin has published a photo essay, an article, and the score of
_Petals_ in _Source_. Inasmuch as Stockhausen was also published in
_Source_, I assume that he was familiar with the contents. (2) Stockhausen
student Johannes Fritsch published an article on Partch´s Harmony in _The
Feedback Papers_.  (3) Former Partch percussionist Michael Ranta was (and
is) resident in Koeln, and worked together with Stockhausen, at least in
procuring Asian Percussion instruments.
