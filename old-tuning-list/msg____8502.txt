I found it interesting that most of these intervals are available in the
standard E9th pedal steel tuning.  See
http://www.b0b.com/infoedu/just_e9.html .  The missing intervals are 8/5,
12/7 and 7/4.  The 8/5 is not totally absent however - good steel players
hit it by ear when they engage the first pedal (which raises 3/2 to 5/3)
half way.

That leaves the 12/7 and 7/4.  Can you form beatless harmonies with these
and other notes of the scale?  I'm having a hard time imaging their use,
maybe because I'm basically a 5-limit player.
