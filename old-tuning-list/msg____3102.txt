Subject: Self-Similar scales correction

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I need to make a correction to the note I posted this AM about
Self-Similar scales. The iterated type of Brian McLaren's that
I discussed is not octave limited, but rather, is bounded
by the generating relation itself.  In his paper "The Uses
and Characteristics of Non-Just Non-Equal-Tempered Scales,"
1993. XH15:27-41, he generates one class of such scales 
by taking a number (e, pi, etc.) converting it to cents
(1200*log(N)/log(2)) and sequentially dividing the cent
values by the original number. If pi is chosen, the initial
value is approximately 1982 cents, then 631, 201, etc. as each 
term is divided by pi. He did not consider more than one such
cycle, that is adding multiples of 1982 to these numbers.
