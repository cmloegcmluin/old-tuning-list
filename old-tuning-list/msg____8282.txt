There's been much excellent discussion on this topic already; I'd just
like to interject that the reason Fourier-type decomposition of periodic
waveforms is useful is because we believe that the inner ear does
something very similar, therefore it tells us something significant
(_pace_ Brian, not _everything_) about how we would hear such a sound.
