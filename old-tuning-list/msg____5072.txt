Subject: Linear Temperaments cont.

< A slightly lower unweighted sum of sq'ed errors, duh, by definition.

I think the "duh" is unnecessary. The mathematics are obvious; my
point was about the appropriateness of the weightings which is
a psychoacoustic question whose answer I don't really know.

You mentioned (ironically) "sharp or flat unisons." I was pointing out
that octaves, fifths, and unisons modified by a 1/4 tone were used
by Wyschnegradsky for expressive purposes, so the statement is not as 
humorously vacuous as it might appear at first sight.

I too agree that the 7/4 is not always the best tuning for the
7th of a dom7th chord. Bosanquet thought that it was disturbing
in melodic passages, though beautiful in full chords (in meantone
systems).

I'm using Bosanquet's nomenclature in which a positive tuning is
one in which the fifth is sharper than 700 cents (some contemporary
writers use the term for fifths sharper than 3/2). The degree to which
a tuning is positive or negative is the number of steps 12 of its fifths
exceeds or falls short of 7 octaves. For untempered systems, this
definition may be modified by approximating their fifths to those of
a tempered system. Thus 1/4-meantone may be treated as a -1 system
by approximating it to 31-tet (others are 7,19,43,55,67). Doubly
negative systems are 14, 26,38,50,62, 74... Primary positive systems
are 5,17,29,41,53... and doubly positive systems are 10,22,34,46....
Triply negative systems are 9, 21, 33, 45, 57,69,81 .... and triply 
positive, 3, 15, 27, 39...

As the chain length for major thirds and harmonic sevenths is so
long in positive systems, more than 12 tones is mandatory for harmonic
music.

I wouldn't put too much faith in the precision of the tunings I posted.
I calculated them in double precision, but I'm not sure the accuracy
is anywhere near the number of decimal places shown. I simply didn't
have the time to round them down to 8 places as I did for the 
negative ones prior to posting them.

I am aware that errors may cancel when the ABS(Sum) is taken rather 
than the Sum(ABS) and I thought the resulting tunings might be
interesting for exactly this reason. Thus in the 1/3-comma tuning the
6/5 is just, in the 1/5 comma, the 15/8 is.

I stress these tunings, for the most part, were generated as a 
theoretical study many years ago. I am not proposing them seriously 
today as I think the corresponding equal temperaments would be 
perceptually equivalent and easier to implement and use, though 
Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi has successfully embodied the 1/9th skhisma 
tuning on a specially fretted guitar. 

The negative tunings might have some value in realizing early music, but
I'm not sure one could really tell the difference from 1/4-comma meantone
or 31-tet within a 12-tone gamut. For a larger series of notes, perhaps..

Bosanquet himself decided that tuning his organ to the 1/7 skhisma 
system was not worth the extra trouble and henceforth used 3/2's.

XH17 will appear when I get all the promised articles.
