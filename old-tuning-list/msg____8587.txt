Subject: Forum CD ready to ship

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Yikes...pardon me, folks, if there's 2 messages about this...my email 
is still a bit sick, but hopefully fixed now. The CD is ready to go, but 
I do need shipping $$$ from the participants. Morrison's cost $26.65, and 
I was told that was a ballpark figure for all of them...if you could send 
an amount close to that, I think we're in business. Morrison, by the way, 
gets MVP award on this project, for helping to keep things moving with 
some extra cash when most needed...thanks a zillion. I'll be curious to 
see what everyone thinks, and I'm up for Vol. 2 if anyone is 
interested...keep me posted...Hstick
