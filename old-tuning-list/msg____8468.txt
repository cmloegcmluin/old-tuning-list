I have very little experience in this area, but would venture that their =

some confusion in the use of the term 'blue note'. Most just

harmonically, creating a stable harmonic background. What happens

This reminds me a bit of the Schoenberg-Schenker controversy, which has

With the caveat that the choice of melodic blues notes may reflect some
qualitative assesment of the dissonance to the underlying harmony (e.g. i=

terms of beating) I imagine that blues players and their just-intoned
followers are working within the Schenkerian framework. =
