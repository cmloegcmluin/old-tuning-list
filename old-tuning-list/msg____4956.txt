HUH?

Either:

1. C# and Db are distinct pitches, as on a split-keyed instrument 
intended for meantone tunings, or else 

2. the distinction is purely notational, as on any 12-per octave 
keyboard, whether tuned to 12TET or to a well-tempered scheme. In this 
case, the distinction can either be

2a.  functional (e.g. a C#, and not a Db, as the leading note to D 
major or minor) 

2b. or  arbitrary (e.g. Bach's choice of Eb minor for the eighth 
Prelude and Fugue of Book I, but D# minor for the eighth Prelude and 
Fugue of Book II). Such arbitrary choices can be made on the basis of 
various equally arbitrary associations, such as sharps brilliance 
and flats mellowness etc., but they have no physical basis 
whatsoever (do I really need to say this?) and such associations will 
in any case vary from listener to listener.

No! As I said above, the distinction only makes sense on instruments 
which allow for more than 12 pitch-classes per octave.

Well-temperaments were given their name to distinguish them from other 
temperaments -- namely the meantone family -- which did not allow the 
playing of all keys, or limitless modulation on a 12-per-octave 
keyboard. On a well-tempered instrument, there is no acoustical 
difference between the keys of Db and C# (whatever different 
associations the different notation might evoke for Will Grant); on a 
meantone instrument, the issue is more complicated: taking the lower 
rank of keys to be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, then if there is only one 
upper rank key between C and D, it is of course not arbitrary whether 
that key is C# or Db, but a matter of intervallic relations between 
this key and those of the lower rank (it was always in practice C#, 
simply because this was needed much more often, as a ficta 
leading-note). However, to have two acoustically distinct scales of C# 
and Db on a meantone keyboard would require no less than 19 keys per 
octave (and still more if you wanted to play any pieces in these 
keys). 

Anyone who holds that C# major and Db major can be distinguished, on 
grounds that are neither acoustic, nor associational has fallen prey 
to terminal mystificatory impulses. If Will Grant is happy to accept 
the associational explanation, I have no argument. Otherwise ... 
(there's no arguing over mystical beliefs.)
