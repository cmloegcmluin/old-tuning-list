   I designed some flutes back in high school using a frequency counter I
built from a kit.  It was, however, designed to work with much radio
frequencies, so what they advertised as astounding resolution to plus or minus
1Hz, wasn't so impressive for audio frequencies.  But I was able to get away
with by averaging several measurements.
