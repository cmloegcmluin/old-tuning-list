Subject: Radiant Christmas {chords}

From: "Debra Shea-Stearns" <stearns@capecod.net>

Think me mad—but I’ll gladly choose the shimmering ‘beats’ of a sustained
choir (of voices, strings, brass, or winds…) intoning a 12 : 4 : 7 : 10 : 14
: 17 : 21 : [22] : 25 : 27 of 12 EDO* over the pellucid ‘pulses’ of the same
(choir of voices, strings, brass, or winds)  intoning a 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 9 :
11 : 13 : 15 : 17 : 19 of the harmonic series.

Respectfully
D—Stearns

* As far as acronyms go… (E)quidistant (D)ivision of the (O)ctave’s— EDO, is
certainly seems to me a rather colorless creation (immanently indisposed as
it is to the oddly resonant charm of (T)one (E)qual (T)emperament’s—TET),
but I do believe it 'better says' what (I believe) 'needs saying'… and as
such I feel somewhat obligated to continue to pretend I like it (and
apologize for saying so).
