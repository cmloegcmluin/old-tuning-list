Subject: Chalmers-Mclaren postings

From: wabi@server.net4you.co.at (Helmut Wabnig)

Please excuse me if I am asking a superfluous
question about the psychoacustic series. 
Which one is the author? Is it Chalmers or Mclaren
or are they a duo? Maybe it was mentioned in the 
first postings, I remember that 25 were announced,
but some were lost during my computer hazards.
Why am I asking? I wish to express my thanks and
my gratitude to the originators. The psychoacustic 
postings are amongst the most interesting readings
which I have collected so far. The whole documentation
must be the result of years of work. I think it is
worth to be line-edited into a book and supplemented 
with illustrations. Don't be curious why your audience
is silent and quiet, we are busy reading and learning!
yours
