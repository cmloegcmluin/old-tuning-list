My efforts may be futile. Oh well. If anybody wants

I'd disagree here. 

Different sized whole tones are not a problem, but rather 
a revelation. Their confounding into a single interval 
loses a beautiful and natural distinction. The perfect
example is the 8:9:10:12 voicing.

Comma shifts are not a "problem" either, since they are 
required by the harmonic context and make perfect sense 
as in-tune chord members. Comma shifts are merely voice 
leading, in the same manner as one would move by seconds 
to voice lead--the only difference is the smaller size of 
commas (such as my favorite 81/80) as compared to seconds. 
To say that comma shifts are somehow invalid is like saying 
that it's invalid to move the B up to a C when resolving 
V to I in C. Voice leading is voice leading. 

Out-of-tune chords only happen in JI when you don't use 
the correct pitches, as when your instrument's pitch set 
is finite and you must employ the closest available 
substitute. This is not true JI but a form of "surdism" 
(a coined modification of a term I read in Partch).

"Wandering tonics" is a misnomer. Wandering tonics fall 
into the voice-leading category, as demanded by harmonic 
context. A vi minor chord whose third is not the same pitch
as the tonic of the key is not a relative of nor a substitute 
for the I chord--it's a different chord with its own 
required pitches. (There is also a vi minor chord which is 
a relative of the I chord, of course.) The fact that 
the third of this chord lies close to the tonic of the key 
should not be taken to mean that they are both tonics of 
the key, one being "wandered", any more than the leading 
tone should be considered a "wandered" tonic, or the major 
third of the V of ii (near C# in C) should be considered a 
"wandered" tonic. 

I think the "problems" some people have in trying to 
translate existing "diatonic triadic" music into JI 
are related to conceptions about pitch class. I hold 
that there are more than 7 pitch classes implied in 
much supposedly diatonic music, but that many of the 
pitch classes are confounded into single representation
in 12tet and other finite tuning systems. These systems
allow for errors to be written into the music without
being caught because the errors are distributed across some
number of chords in a progression. When such music is 
"translated" into JI the errors become apparent and JI 
is blamed (like killing the messenger of bad news) 
rather than the confounded tuning system which allowed 
the composer to write those errors in the first place.

Will you explain this dissonance function with 
figures please? It sounds interesting but I'm 
not sure what you mean by derivative. 

In JI, I prefer to think of the "complexity" (or something,
rather than "dissonance") of an interval or sonority, which 
I measure not by multiplying the members of a ratio or 
chord, but by adding them! As an example, 4/1 is about as 
"complex" as 3/2 by my rule of thumb, and 8/5 is about as
"complex" as 9/4. 

In systems which deviate from just by small amounts, 
I'm not really sure how to calculate dissonance, 
except that it may have something to do with the 
speed of beating (faster beating, more dissonance).

That's very interesting mathematically and I will want
to work it through from scratch myself someday
to really "get it". I'm afraid I'd still classify 
weighted mean-tone as an error-spreading and pitch-class- 
confounding system though. Its main value would be
in the tuning of instruments whose pitch sets are finite
and not manually adjustable during performance, especially 
for period music.

Of course this is not the same as claiming to have found a 
better physical model for the mapping of ghosttones as 
Charles Lucy is.
