Subject: one more for Harry

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...actually, I was done with the H word, but I must
comment briefly on Beardsley's last post...dude, first of all it's
Thumbs CARLILLE, not Thumbs Charlie...and, he was indeed a genius,
and playing on his lap was no novelty or gimmick...have you ever
heard Thumbs? I get the feeling the answer is no...and Albert was
an innovator in blues...he created one of the most powerful and unique
voices in the genre, and influenced Hendrix greatly. Of course, Partch
was an innovator...but, again, I see him more as a theoretical genius
than one who touches me on any profound spiritual or emotional levels.
Partch reminds me, in a way, of Johnny Smith, the well known jazz
guitarist...Smith makes folks pee with his technique, but I saw him
twice and he was a boring MF. Partch is surely not boring, but I sure
don't feel his music hits those deep, deep levels where the Creator
dwells...bitterness and bleakness are very present in a lot of Uncle
Harry's music, I feel, and that ain't the final destination...besides,
could he play his cloud chamber bowls behind his head, like T-Bone
Walker did with his guitar, or could he duckwalk with his kithara like
Chuck Berry?...Hstick
