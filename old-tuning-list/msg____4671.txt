Subject: James Wood tunings

From: Franck Jedrzejewski <franck@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr>

Last year, Garry asked me about James Wood Tunings. I don't know
what tunings he used but I read in the booklet of the CD 
	Spirit Festival with Lamentations & Village Burial with Fire
	Mode Records / New York
that he designed and built an instrument : the microxyl.

"The straight microxyls consist of 36 pieces of wooden dowel laid
over a resonating box - the total range of each microxyl is between 
a 3/4 tone (150 cents) and a minor third (300 cents). Thus the interval
between the individual keys of each microxyl is between 4 and 8 cents. 
The instrument is designed to be stroked, (not struck), and it's
resulting pitch-bending has the potential to be extremely expressive.
The idea behind this instrument was to represent the inner sadness 
of the mourners. In contrast, the elliptical microxyl has a very
different, almost cosmic character -it has 45 keys whose individual 
pitches from an elliptical curve, the intervals between 2 cents at the
bottom end and a perfect fourth at the top end. This represents the
mourners outward joy over the freeing of the soul into the spirit world"
(James Wood - september 1995)
