I'm afraid I'm not following. How could CD manufacturers add overtones? If
you mean that they are adding harmonics to the recorded sound, then the
highest pitch that they could add a harmonic to would be 11 kHz, since its
second harmonic (first "overtone") would be at 22kHz. All CD players
include an anti-imaging filter that effectively eliminates all frequencies
higher than 22k anyway (often with significant attenuation above about
18k).

Some harmonics do occur because of distortion created in the analog
circuits as well as the "squaring-off" of waves close to the digital
resolution in either amplitude or frequency. However, audio companies work
very hard to MINIMIZE these harmonics, as listeners find them very
objectionable. Any digital harmonic distortion of tones above 11kHz should
be eliminated by the anti-imaging filter.

Harmonic distortion of waves close to the lowest representable amplitude is
generally "smoothed out" by the introduction of dither, a small amount of
noise, which effectively distributes the energy within the spurious
harmonics throughout the frequency spectrum. Listener tests have shown that
the extra noise is much less objectionable than the equivalent amount of
harmonic distortion.

It is very clear that very few people can consciously detect sine waves at
20kHz. Many people, in fact, have a hard time hearing above 15 or even
12kHz, depending on their age, sex, and lifetime exposure to loud sounds. I
have heard that some people can detect timbral differences in very high
sounds, but I have not yet seen a reference. I do not deny the possibility
that ultrasonic sounds can have some kind of significant physiological
effect, but I've yet to see any evidence to support that, much less that
this effect is somehow perceptible.
