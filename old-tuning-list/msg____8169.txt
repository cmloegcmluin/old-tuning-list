   I take it then that you are pondering cases where the pitches would
go ultrasonic if not brought down into the orginal octave?  If so, then
it's an impossible question to answer, since there's no basis in
everyday experience within which to answer the question.

   But it's fun to imagine "what if" sorts of answers!
