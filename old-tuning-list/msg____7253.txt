Subject: TUNERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@tiac.net>

I got my notice this week that the Annual Convention of the Piano
Technician's guild will be July 8-12 in Provicence, Rhode Island this
year. The only tuning class they're touting in advance is something called
'Temperament Festival' by someone named Skip Becker. If it is just a
chance to rejoice at one's ability to produce identical 12-tet every time,
any other tuners who are likely to be there and I should get together and
picket it...
