Subject: Blues tunings

From: "MandLDixon" <MandLDixon@bigpond.com>

I've been doing a study of blues music recently and am having trouble
understanding why some members of the Just Intonation community consider the
7-limit representative of 'blue' notes.

My listening, reading, and talking to artists in the field indicates that a
'blue' 3rd, for instance, can sound  anywhere in-between a minor and major
3rd, with or without sliding.  Artists such as Muddy Waters, 'Big Boy'
Crudup, some of the so-called Guitar Evangelists, some early Gospel singers,
and so on, sing many neutral intervals.  A low minor 7th occurs very rarely,
and a low minor 3rd even less.

If ratios can describe intonation of 'blue' notes then the 11-limit would
describe such notes better.

Perhaps this subject has been done here before, if so I apologise,

sincerely,
