Move the pitch bend to a point earlier in the file. Before the
note you're bending. I use Cakewalk Pro for Windows. If I open an event
window, I can look at every midi event on one or more channels. 
This makes midi events look more like a programming language.

What I'd like to know is how to translate +/- 99 cents into +/- 8192
pitch bends. I use a Proteus/2 and I find that with tunings
that have more than 12 tones the timbre of the samples get 
stretched so much that a clarinet or a bassoon don't sound right.

Also, I'd be able to change tunings in a piece at whim. I wouldn't
have to mess with the tuning tables of the synth.
