I heard that!  It sounded really good.  There was tension between the
piano and the others, with the piano as the poorly tuned one.  It was
on quite late, though, so I wasn't fully alert.  It's from a
"forthcoming" CD.

I knew nothing about the meeting between Ligeti and Partch.  Does
anyone?


After a brief experiment, I've concluded that the internal MIDI
stream in a PC is _not_ restricted to the MIDI hardware speed.
I think I was getting controller changes every 43 microseconds,
although I haven't worked out Cubase's timing format yet.  Maybe
someone with a Tropez Plus could measure how long the tuning dumps
really take to arrive.


I don't usually concern myself with acoustic instruments, but
wouldn't a 19 or 22TET flute make more sense than a "quartertone"
one?
