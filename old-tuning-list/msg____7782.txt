Subject: Re: Buzz Feiten 2

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I just got off the phone with a luthier who learned the Buzz 
Feiten system from Buzz, and currently modifies guitars to aaccomodate 
the system. He tells me that Buzz figured out the system by ear and that 
the patent does not tell the whole story. Further, he states that the 
luthier who helped Buzz implement the physical modification of the 
fingerboard is responsible for some of the misinformation and misuse of 
the terms meantone and well temperament appearing in the ads and interviews.
	I am told that the nut is shifted and angled, the strings are tuned 
slightly differently from 12TET and the bridge compensation is tuned 
differently from standard practice. My luthier contact, who is familiar with 
the history of tuning and temperaments says that the method really does 
reduce out of tuneness, especially when a modified guitar plays with a 
piano. This seems to indicate that there is some stretching. I still 
don't know the lowdown skinny on what it does "really", but it would be 
interesting to find out in more detail and do an analysis. 
	Was my previous post a little harsh on Buzz? Perhaps. I was 
incensed by the misinformation in the literature I had read, but 
apparently the patent does not tell the whole story, and the ads a 
distorted story. I am told that Buzz is innocent of the promulgation of 
buzzwords, and I aploogize for any blame I may have thrown his way.
