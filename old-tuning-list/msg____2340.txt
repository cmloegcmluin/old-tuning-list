Subject: Bohlen-Pierce cont.

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

Here is some further information on the Bohlen-Pierce scale of 9 tones 
from the 13th root of 3/1 gamut. J.R. Pierce constructed it from four 
3:5:7 triads as I explained in my post and mapped these notes into the 
13th root of 3/1 ET gamut. The melodic pattern is 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 
degrees, a mode of the MOS whose generator is 3 degrees. 
 
The ratios generated by Pierce's derivation are one of several possible 
just intonations for his set of 9 tones and by extension of the entire
set of 13 notes. Bohlen gives the following JI interpretation of the 
entire 13-tone scale: 1/1 27/25 25/21 9/7 7/5 75/49 5/3 9/5 49/25 15/7 
7/3 63/25 25/9 3/1. 
 
Bohlen used a method based on the 1/1 5/3 7/3 triad and combination 
tones to derive this  tuning for the 13 tone scale and selected two 
subscales from the entire set.  His delta (from dur, major) scale 
(2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 ) is a mode of Pierce's tempered form and has the 
ratios 1/1 25/21 9/7 75/49 5/3 9/5 15/7 7/3 25/9 3/1. The gamma (minor?)
scale is not a mode of the above scale nor even an MOS, though it has 
9 tones as well. Its successive intervals are  1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 and its 
JI form is 1/1 27/25 9/7 7/5 5/3 9/5 49/25 7/3 25/9 3/1. 
 
In addition to these 9-tone scales, Bohlen also mentions a 12-tone
scale repeating at the 3/1. It is generated from the 1/1 7/4 5/2
triad. In ratios, it is 1/1 11/10 6/5 30/23 10/7 11/7 7/4 21/11 21/10 
23/10 5/2 11/4 3/1. From the 1/1 3/2 5/2, he derives a 7 tone per
octave, 11 tone per 3/1, scale: 1/1 10/9 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1 9/4
5/2 27/10 3/1. These are obviously related to quite different just 
intonations for the 13th root of 3 scale.
 
An 8-tone set derived from the 1/1 7/5 9/5 chord is also described 
by Bohlen, but dismissed as a curiosity.It has the ratios 1/1 10/9 6/5 
9/7 7/5 14/9 5/3 9/5 2/1 and repeats at the octave.
 
To be honest, I do not understand how these scales are
derived from the basic chords.
 
Bohlen also proposes a logarithmic system of 1300 "hekts" to 
the 3/1 analogous to the cycle of 1200 cents to the 2/1. To
calculate hekts, multiply the log of the interval by 1300 and
divide by the log of 3.  One assumes that hekt means a hundredth 
of a scale step and derives from the Greek hekaton (100) and the 
metric prefix hecto-.

Bohlen. He refers to his unpublished manuscripts dated 1972 and 1974. 
R. Wille may have also described the whole gamut in 1975 as well, but  
Bohlen would appear to have priority.)

selected 9 of the 13-tones.)
