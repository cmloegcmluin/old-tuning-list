Subject: Lattice, LCM, and Aliquot Parts

From: Mckyyy@aol.com

Hi Graham,

On octave invariance, it has just occurred to me that, in LCM
terms, the octave has a property that no other ratio shares. 
That is two notes that differ only by octaves can be mixed
without making the length of the resulting "interference" pattern
longer than the waveform of the lowest note.

If you mix two notes of wavelength 1 and 8, the wavelength of the
resulting pattern is still 8, but if you mix two notes of
wavelength 2 and 3, the resulting pattern has a wavelength of 6.

This property makes it much easier to sing in octaves than any
other interval, because the basic perception of the fundamental
frequency of a melody is not disturbed, and is a justification
for the principle of octave invariance.

Another form of invariance, ratio invariance, is important in LCM
analysis.  This became clear to me during a discussion I had with
Paul E. some time ago.  Thinking back over that, it seems to me
that our differences of opinion on the subject of the length of
LCM patterns was mostly due to different assumptions about ratio
invariance.  I was assuming ratio invariance, he was not.  I'm
still not absolutely clear on all this and would appreciate any
comments.

Aliquot parts are simply a list of all the possible numbers that
can be derived by multiplying subsets of the prime factors of a
given number.  For example, here is a list of the aliquot parts
of 2880:

1 1
2 2
3 3
4 2^2
5 5
6 2*3
8 2^3
9 3^2
10 2*5
12 2^2*3
15 3*5
16 2^4
18 2*3^2
20 2^2*5
24 2^3*3
30 2*3*5
32 2^5
36 2^2*3^2
40 2^3*5
45 3^2*5
48 2^4*3
60 2^2*3*5
64 2^6
72 2^3*3^2
80 2^4*5
90 2*3^2*5
96 2^5*3
120 2^3*3*5
144 2^4*3^2
160 2^5*5
180 2^2*3^2*5
192 2^6*3
240 2^4*3*5
288 2^5*3^2
320 2^6*5
360 2^3*3^2*5
480 2^5*3*5
576 2^6*3^2
720 2^4*3^2*5
960 2^6*3*5
1440 2^5*3^2*5
2880 2^6*3^2*5

This list contains the seven-tone Zarlino scale, and 2880 is the
LCM of that scale.  That is not a coincidence.  A list of aliquot
parts contains all the scales that can be made from a given LCM.

Most of the utilities distributed with my FasTrak Sequencer use
this principle.

To classify the chords in a given scale, I just sort them by
their LCM's, or by their pattern length, if I do not want to
think in terms of ratio invariance.  I find this to be much
simpler and easier to work with than multidimensional ratio
analysis.

But the big advantage, from my exact JI point of view, is that it
gives me an easy way to analyze the musical possibilities of a
given frequency divider network, and all modern electronic
musical instruments use some form of frequency division in the
sense that all the musical output is phase locked to some high
frequency signal in the system, therefore these systems have the
capability of producing exact musical intervals if programmed
properly.

Note that octave inversion of a chord can double its LCM.
