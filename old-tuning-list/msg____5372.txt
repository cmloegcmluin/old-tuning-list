Subject: Suggestions on cabinet building

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

This post doesn't have as much to do with tuning as it does with sound. I'm
hoping to build a pair of matched leslie-type speakers but currently I don't
know much about the acoustics of cabinet building. Does anyone know of a good
book that would act as a practical reference source for this sort of thing. In
fact, I would be interested in talking to someone first hand who builds or
designs cabinets. So, if anyone of you know someone that might take a few
moments out to talk to me about this I would appreciate if you could pass
my name and number along to them or, conversly, send me their name and number.
Thanks,

Denis Atadan
