If you're doing the stacking and maintaining the intermediary tones in
the chord, then I would agree with them. Otherwise I would disagree. But
there's more.

"An arbitrary power of two produces an effect of equivalence." This must
of course include the case where the power is zero, and the equivalence
is greatest. The equivalence evidently falls off as the power increases.

But what about steely coldness? Is it there when the power is zero? Does
a unison contain all potential interval qualities, to a greater degree
than the intervals themselves? It would seem hard to argue that way.

The equivalence Dave was referring to was not a property of intervals
themselves, but a similarity relation between different intevals. If
there was a specific quality associated with given prime factors, than
that quality might result in a similarity between different intervals
with the same prime factors albeit to different powers. But it seems
hard to formulate a consistent theory along those lines.

What about intervals like 3/5? Does this have both steely coldness and
sweetness? You can't say it has steely coldness and anti-sweetness
because a 5/3 sounds the same as a 3/5. So does 15/1 (or 15/8) have the
same qualities as 5/3, since the factors are still 5 and 3? It seems
hard to maintain that 5/3 has a greater affective similarity to 15/8 (or
15/1) than to any other interval. But that is exactly where such an
association of primes with qualities leads.

No more time now, but I think any such prime-quality theory could be
shown to be either logically inconsistent or severly at variance with
observation.
