Subject: Re: Forum CD

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I have placed an asterisk next to the names of the microtonalists 
on my Microtonalists page who participated in the Forum CD so that they 
may be contacted by those who wish to purchase a CD. I don't have URLs 
for Neil Haverstick, Ernie Crews, Richard Sanford, Carter Scholz or 
Stephen James Taylor. I would like to post the addresses of 
Forum CD participants on the Forum CD in Real Audio page, so if any of 
you folks on the CD wish me to post your address, could you please send 
me the information?
