Paul, you're right, and my paper is wrong. I guess 11/9 is often harder
to hear than some other ratios of 11, and I was too eager to provide a
simple mathematical description of what I heard. I should trash all of
page 20 (in the .pdf version) of my paper, as well as two columns of
table 5. Although it's too late for Xenharmonikon, perhaps if Carl Lumma
reppears we can revise the .pdf version accordingly. Aaargh!!!

Do you mean Brian McLaren? I don't remember those days too well.
