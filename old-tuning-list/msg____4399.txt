He just means that C is the tonic of C, the leading tone of C#, the flat 7th of D, etc. The pitch C has 12 
"senses" depending on which pitch you consider the tonic. Do this for all 12 notes and all 12 tonics and you 
get 12 * 12 144 different "senses" of some pitch taken against some tonic in 12tet.

I'm not sure which 13 degrees he's talking about, but he's doing the same thing; seeing how many ways each of 
the 13 pitches he's isolated can be interpreted musically depending on which tonic (Numerary Nexus actually, 
which is almost like tonic) is assumed. I believe that not all pitch relationships are counted as valid senses 
by Partch (see below) so counting senses in a Partch scale is not as simple as s n * n, where n is the 
number of pitches and s is the number of senses. 

I'm going on memory again, but here's how I think it works: 

For instance, 5/7 is neither in the otonality nor utonality of 1, 
otonality of 1 1/1 3/1 5/1 7/1, etc.
utonality of 1 1/1 1/3 1/5 1/7, etc.
so 5/7 has no valid sense when 1 is considered the Numerary Nexus.

It is however in the utonality of 5, 
utonality of 5 5/1 5/3 5/5 5/7 (bingo), etc. 
and it's also in the otonality of 7, 
otonality of 7 1/7 3/7 5/7 (bingo) 7/7, etc.
so 5/7 has at least two valid senses.

I think he's counting senses to argue that even though you can't modulate indefinitely in a just scale with a 
fixed number of tones (43 in his case) you can still play in many keys and have the tones to cover the senses 
required to play in those keys. If you work with instruments which allow adjustment of pitch, you don't have 
to worry about counting senses and playing in only certain keys, because you can modulate indefinitely and 
never run out of notes.
