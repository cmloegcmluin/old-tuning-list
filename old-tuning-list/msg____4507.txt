Maybe I misunderstand your point, but how else would you represent them? 
I notice you use ratios as you continue:

You've just used ratios to distinguish two _different_ major seconds. I've
read these described as the large just major second and the small just
major second, and other names. These would be distinguished from the septimal 
major second. These various and imprecise English-y names can be dispensed with 
by the use of ratios.

They are distinct consonances (or dissonances, depending on how you define the
consonance/dissonance threshold). Assuming this typical diatonic major scale, 
C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1,
compare the chord C-D-E-G or 8:9:10:12, 
with the chord G-A-B-D which is not 8:9:10:12.

In another example, assuming a pan-modal approach (drawing chords from multiple 
diatonic modes on the same tonic), compare the D in the chord C-D-E-G 8:9:10:12 
with the D in the chord Bb-C-D-F 8:9:10:12, keeping C the same. These are two 
different D's. The best way that I know of to distinguish them and at the same 
time describe their ideal tuning is to use ratios. The first D is 9/8 in the key 
of C, and the second is 10/9 in the key of C.

Each equal temperament may provide a maximum of one rational interval only.
41-equal contains no 9 limit intervals save 2/1. To say that it distinguishes 
9/8 from 10/9 (and the rest of the 9-limit intervals) is to say that it contains 
intervals which may be used to misrepresent these rational intervals by 
approximation using a different number of 41-equal degrees for each. 

By my hearing, most equal temperaments work in proportion to the extent that 
they get close to rational intervals, thanks or curses to the ear's natural 
attraction to rational intervals and its propensity for interpretting 
random intervals as perversions of rational intervals--which leads me to think 
it best use the rational intervals directly. The rest of the equal temperaments 
work to the extent that they get away from rational intervals and give us a 
way to hear which lets us break away from the tyranny of the gestalt of rational 
intervals. Even this though is a reactionary way of hearing which bases itself 
on the gestalt of the rational intervals as something to get away from.

If you are suggesting that we attach et-41 names to 9-limit intervals
for the sake of ease of handling and communication, while understanding
that the intervals are to be tuned justly, that's fine, until you want to 
include other rational intervals. Then you run into the problem of finding 
the next best ET whose names can be mapped over the intervals we require,
and renaming all the intervals we've already come to recognize using et-41
names. I think using ratios is the most explicit, and most extensible notation 
available for handling rational intervals in discussions like this.
