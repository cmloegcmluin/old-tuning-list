   I'm inclined to agree with Paul's assessment that using the borrowed
ii-chord is more or less a way of avoiding the problem.  And a clever one
too.  It's avoiding the problem in the sense that, by substituting a chord
that is inherently more discordant, you made it plausible to use the
"wrong" scale degree 2 - wrong that is for submediant of the subdominant,
but right for the dominant of the dominant.  Even more impressively, the
more discordant chord was enough of a surprise that moving the submediant
down from 16 to 15 became plausible as well.  (Then again see my note below
about the tenor part.)

   Putting the movement from 16 to 15 in the tenor part (as it was in the
4-part voicing I suggested) does indeed seem to have made it less
noticeable.  Generally speaking anything in the tenor part won't stand out
as much as soprano or bass.  So I suppose that's not terribly surprising,
and a help tip for making a comma- or pseudocomma-shifted note less
shocking.  



b) the function within the chord of the tone undergoing the pitch shift.

   Perhaps so, in particular with regard to whether it's a tendency tone or
not.  But I'm personally inclined to think that the overall discordance of
the chord, as with the minor vs. diminished ii, is a bigger factor.  Or
perhaps more generally than discordance, but the surprisingness of the
chord.  Adding a b7 to that chord might have made note shifts even harder
to pinpoint because the unusualness of that chord distracts listeners'
attention from the shifts.

   Wandering tonics of course are one of my big fascinations in this field
of unusual tunings, so I always enjoy hearing impressions of how they
affect people.  Thanks for describing that impression.  

   The first time I heard a wandering tonic was, something like about 10
years ago, when I programmed it into Dave Hill's setup at FSU's Center for
Music Research.  I had HEARD OF the idea before that, I think from John
Chalmers but I'm not sure, when Glen Prior experimented with them on one of
Erv Wilson's 53TET tubulogs.  

   In that case of 53TET, and the JI example at FSU, the comma shift was
more sneaky, presumably because the amount of shift was smaller (roughly 22
cents instead of well over twice that in 22TET).  So the effect of "normal,
normal, normal, normal ... yeah yeah same ol' stuff, ... HUH?!  How the
hell did we get here??!!" is a bit more mysterious than on 22TET.  I'd like
to try that example in 34TET to hear it on an intermediate size of shift. 
It should be available in 41TET as well.

   I know that a while back I mentioned that you can shift the pitch upward
similarly with a I-IV-V7-I progression by making scale-degree 4 of the
IV-chord match a 7:4 seventh of the V7 chord.  In a purely JI scenario, the
tonic would wander up by 36:35, which is quite a bit more than the 81:80
downward wander of the comma-shift mentioned earlier.
