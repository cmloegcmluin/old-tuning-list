Bob,

I don't know how much bother is involved in tuning the pedal steel,
[I'll have a look at your page when I get a chance] but assuming it's
significantly less than a hammered dulcimer, I'd say just tune it up
and play around!  That's the best way to learn, IMHO.

I'd strongly encourage you to approach it withOUT any expectations.
My first forays into tuning were so tainted, and it's taken me a bit
of effort to overcome my preconceived biases and just listen to what a
tuning has to offer.  Whether you like it, and how much, and for what,
will depend on you and the music you want to make with it.  And, don't
stop there!

You may, in fact probably will, find *several* tunings that you like
for different purposes.  So, try them!  Try a bunch!  Try as many
tunings as you can think of, or as are feasable on your instrument,
even if you think they won't work for you.  You could be right, but
you may be pleasantly suprised, or discover another path to run down.
You'll never know if you don't listen to them.

It can be a bit difficult, at least it was [and sometimes still is!]
for me, but think of it a Zen-like exercise -- it will eventually lead
to enlightenment.  [And I'm the first to admit that "I'm not there yet"
and I've got a lot more tuning to do.]

Always beginning... tune on,

Steve

PS Welcome to the list :-)
