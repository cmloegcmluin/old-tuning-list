From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

I would think it likely that if there is any connection between math
scores and listening to Mozart, it would be of the nature you suggested
(carefully metered phrasing and such).

   I suppose some might suggest a more socially "charged" explantions to
the effect that certain other styles of music are decadent or something to
that effect.  Although I personally like Mozart a lot, I'm still more
inclined to think that this is just somebody's pet theory run amok.

   On a more-or-less similar note (all puns intended of course), here's a
quote from "The Handy Science Answer Book" page 207:

How do different kinds of music affect plant growth?

In experiments done in the 1960s and 1970s, plants rsponded best to
classical and Indian devotional music.  In a controlled environment, plants
exposed to these kinds of music had lush and abundant growth and good root
development.  Exposure to country music or silence brought no abnormal
growth reaction, while jazz produced more abundant growth.  With rock
music, plants did poorly.  Their roots were scrawny and sparse and they
seemed to be in a dying stage.  Plants exposed solely to white noise died
quickly.
