Subject: JiCalc, consistency

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Re JiCalc: Do none of the functions work on PowerMacs or just the
sound and ear-training modules? Specifically, can one still use it
as a tuning editor cum scale archive?

Re Consistency: I may have missed part of this discussion, but I don't
quite grasph how fractional consistency can be defined on a closed,
cyclic, and equally-tempered tuning system. Or am I just humor-impaired
this AM (in general, perhaps,  as I'm sweltering in the Texas heat and
humidity preparing to become homeless <g> if and when my house sale
closes next week).

Although this may have been discussed previously, it seems to me that
higher-level consistency, fractional accuracy, and similar concerns
are most important. Because of the perceptual effects described in
George Miller's classic paper, "The Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus
Two...,"  one probably is going to have difficulties projecting complex
multidimensional, multi-toned static scales per se. Rather I think one 
would partition such constructs into sub-scales, motifs, chordal sets, etc.
It is in modulating such objects and writing long chordal progressions that
higher order consistency becomes important. Fractional errors rather than 
just absolute errors accumulate under such conditions and one may not 
arrive 
on the note(s) desired. Hence higher-order consistency and similar 
properties 
become very important descriptors in musically dynamic contexts and are
not just intellectual excercises.

Back in the late 60's when Erv Wilson and I did our study of ET's,
Erv had me generate a table of what we called "System Interval Equivalents,"
for each ET and a set of common intervals from the harmonic series. SIE's
were tables of the best JI approximation, the errors in cents and in 
fractions of scale degrees. From this one could compute consistency, 
articulation (which intervals had unique images and which were confused
or fused), etc.
