To these I'd have to add "Divisions of the Tetrachord" by John Chalmers.
Highly recommended. This for me is the logical progression after reading
David Doty's "Just Intonation Primer". (I too was better able to
understand Partch after reading Doty's book). I believe I bought the last
copy of Chalmers' book that the Just Intonation Network Store had. You'd
better enquire at the above site.

If you get this book, you'll need to get it bound. When it gets the
recognition it deserves, maybe the publishers will be in a position to
issue it in hard back. In the mean time, buy a copy and take it to a book
binder. That way you can get your own copy of this amazing book with
scenic binding for just a few extra dollars. It is well worth it. I hope
the JIN Store intends to stock more as I know several students who also
want their own copy.
