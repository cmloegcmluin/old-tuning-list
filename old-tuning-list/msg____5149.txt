   (Hmmm...  Well, I'm not sure that death would qualify as an astrological
force, but that's not your point.)

   Death is certainly one of those things in our world that can be
approached from a scientific or a religious perspective.  But although the
topic is the same, the answer is different.  The reason the answer is
different, is because the question is different.

   The scientific questions about death are all addressed under the heading
of Medical Science.  Certainly it's not difficult, for most causes of death
anyway, to explain the mechanism in cold, unambiguous, logical terms.  

   But that's pretty much the proverbial "water under the bridge" when it
comes to the religious angle on death.  Because in that case the questions
are entirely different:  "How will the surviving family deal with grief?",
"will we ever see the deceased again?", for example.  

   And music is similar, as I aluded in my previous post.  It has a clear
physical underpinning, and it also has deep impacts on our feelings.  But
just because they're both consequences of music doesn't mean that the study
of one will necessarily help you draw conclusions in the other.  


   But all that aside, there's certainly nothing mysterious about the
effects of the recent solar discharge upon satellites and upon terrestrial
organisms including people.  It had little readily apparent effect upon us,
and damaged a satellite, largely because the satellite is outside of the
shield of our atmosphere.
