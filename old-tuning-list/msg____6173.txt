Subject: Re: Sysex vs. Pitch Bend

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

The MIDI Tuning Standard allows 128 notes to be tuned at a time.
If your instrument has multiple tuning tables, there is a SysEx
for switching between them.  If that isn't good enough for you,
you'll have to use pitch bends.  It means you can only play 15
notes at a time.  Funnily enough, I've never heard guitarists
complain about only having 6 strings.

MTS is superb, if you can afford equipment that supports it.  It
is more accurate than any acoustic instrument (except maybe for
JI) but less precise if you only get 1 cent steps.

A preliminary look at the EMU/Creative Sound Font 2 standard
shows that it is possible to embed tunings in voice files, in a
memory efficient way.  If this is set up before performance,
changing scales simply requires a patch change message.  I
intend to write some software to add the tunings to the files.
Unfortunately, it's fundamentally limited to 1 cent steps, but
that's a hell of a lot better than nothing.
