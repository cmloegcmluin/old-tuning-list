The rules of counterpoint certainly continued to be taught (and still are, 
no?), but most apply equally well to tonal music.  The Well-Tempered Clavier 
is not modal!  And surely the concepts of chord progressions and key 
relationships have been far more fundamental in musical training.

.. thereby producing tonal music!!  Perhaps we're using different 
definitions of tonality, but the one I know defines it in terms of key 
centers, chord progressions, and modulation, not melody.  Since you often put 
"modal" in quotes, I'm not sure what you mean by it.  Are you saying that 
Schumann wrote pieces that do not modulate or use chordal (tonal) harmony?

I do need to beat a retreat from my hasty generalization about the use of 
modes ("well, hardly ever"...), especially regarding 20th century music, but 
I remain unconvinced that modes have ever returned as the *basis* of music 
theory or compositional styles in the Western classical tradition.

Are you just referring to the _final_ of the mode, or do you really mean 
"tonal center" defined harmonically?  Because that is the defining 
distinction between modes and keys.  A key is not just a set of notes - it is 
determined by chordal structure rather than melodic formulae.
