Subject: Lydia comments on x/y/z scale coding system used by Bill Alves

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

Beware!!!!!,,,,, long posting on scalecoding from Lucy follows this short 
one.
 
Lydia Ayers queried the use of the scale x/y/z notation.
 
I agree with her implied criticism of the ambiguity of this system.
 
I have used it for many years, yet to mean something totally
different, and much more precise than the vague current Alves usage.
 
I tackled Bill on this recently, off-list, and he provided a 
(to my mind) lame justification for his continued use of the
pattern, which was originally devised in about 1989 by John Gibbon,
Jonathan Glasier and myself in Los Angeles and widely distributed
in pamphlet form.
 
My note to him follows on the next posting:
 
In LucyTuning the size of the Large (L) and hence all others is very 
specific.  L(1200/(2*pi)) cents.
 
The scalecoding, which I use is universally applicable for all meantone 
tuning systems (which also of course includes most and many ET tunings).
For meantones, other than LucyTuning, the value of the Large interval 
needs to be be specified.
This is also the interval between the fourth and the fifth interval,
and may be considered as the divergence interval. 
 
 
 
This then gives us a clear and precise way to define all meantone and
associated modes, megamodes, and scales.
[Further tunings may be included if the octave ratio of other than exactly
2 is specified.]
 
Apologies for the long postings, yet I wish to make this quite clear,
and claim prior use of the arrangement x/y/z for scalecoding.
