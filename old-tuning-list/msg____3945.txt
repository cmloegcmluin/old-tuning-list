Subject: Consonance coefficient

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Lorenzo,

I don't think your method will lead you into any serious errors, although it 
seems like the various inversions of a given chord will often differ a lot 
less in consonance than fundamentally different chords. Also, I often prefer 
more dissonant chord voicings on guitar over more consonant ones, if the 
musical context befits them. Of course, for a six-string chord, you have 15 
individual values for dissonance to add up.

Since you are comparing intervals to their inversions and not to 
fundamentally different intervals, the results I posted for you were 
perfectly useless to you. Fortunately, my theory tells you that the 
certainty with which a tempered interval will be perceived as its most 
likely just interpretation is proportional to the denominator of that just 
interval (in lowest terms), and a factor, related to the degree of 
mistuning, which will be the same for all inversions of an interval, and 
thus ignorable for your purposes. So, interpreting this certainty as 
consonance, we can say that the perfect twelfth is twice as consonant as the 
perfect fifth and three times as consonant as the perfect fourth. The major 
tenth is twice as consonant as the major third and 2.5 times as consonant as 
the minor sixth. The major sixth is 1.666666667 times as consonant as the 
minor third or minor tenth. However, the increased consonance of wider 
intervals comes at the price of a thinner harmonic texture, which is not 
always desireable.

For other intervals, the ratio-interpretation will vary according to 
inversion; contact me privately for more details. Also, if I'm treating the 
intervals as non-interacting and simply adding values for each interval in a 
chord, I'd feel better about adding dissonance levels than adding consonance 
levels. To be continued . . .
