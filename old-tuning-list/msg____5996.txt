Subject: Listening to Temperament

From: A440A@aol.com

Greetings all,

     The recording, editing, and everything but the mastering has been done
on the "Beethoven in the Temperaments" CD.  I listened to the DAT in several
recording studios here in Nashville, (places I have worked in and around for
years, big places!), and some country producers and musicians found their way
in to listen. It has been very interesting to hear the comments of Totally
12TET ears as they listen to a Kirnberger III on a 9' Steinway.
       So far, the reactions are split.  In regard to the Thirds, the
increased tempering above the key of Amaj seems to call attention to itself
in about half the listeners.  The increased consonance in the keys with less
key signature is noticed by slightly less than half, and get this...... a
number of "professionals" have not noticed a difference! <sigh>
       There is still one studio here that is keeping the piano in
well-temperament, several songwriters have switched their home pianos over to
"weird-tuning", so the alternate tuning crusade is still on.
      Oddly enough, the vocalists have really taken to the changes; a comment
was, "the first time through, I was sorta off, because it sounded different,
but as soon as I relaxed, it was the most effortlessly I have sung in
years!".  I think I could probably drop a 1/4C meantone on them without
scattering the crowd.
       I am still operating on the thought that people will grow more
harmonically aware via the acceptance of anything other than 12TET.  That
first step off the familiar is important, and we are going to see if Ludwig
Van's stuff on a Well Tempered Steinway helps some of them over the hump.
       More later,  if it is not too much shameless self-promotion,  I will
be glad to notify the list when this CD is available.
Regards to all,
