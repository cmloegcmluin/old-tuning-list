   In the case of the low piano tones, from what I've seen anyway, I doubt
if you'll find much of anything particularly nonharmonic other than some
very low-frequency stuff resulting from the chorus effect between the two
or three strings in each course.  

   High piano tones however will almost certainly show a moderately
significant amount of aharmonicity.  

   You'll probablly see a very small, but definitely significant, amount of
aharmonicity in typical brass tones.  

   Just as a general matter though, you would probably get somewhat more
resolute results (if that's of interest) using the Phase Vocoding
algorithm's method of tracking near-harmonic partials' frequency
deviations.  It does that by taking the time derivative of each partials'
phase values.  You have to have to look at a very short sliver of time to
do that though.
