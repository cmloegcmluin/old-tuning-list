Tunors:

Bob Gilmore sent me the latest issue (Feb. 1998) of the UK publication "The
Wire", subtitled "Adventures in Modern Music". Very interesting looking
mag, I must say. Reason he sent it was a large and very positive review of
the CRI Partch series, and nice advert too, but as I skimmed it I saw....

our own John Starret!

In a column on Multimedia, in a sub-column called "Go To:", it has John's
Microtonal Music Links
(http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html)
listed. The brief blurb is:

"Now that the Tony Conrad box set has finally emerged blinking in the
light, not to mention CRI's re-release of their Harry Partch archive, clear
definitions of Just Intonation and microtonality are in order. Step forward
to this privately maintained page, the best jumping-off point to
investigate this slippery territory. Thus armed, you can sally forth onto
the sites dedicated to Partch, Lou Harrison and Charles Ives; honorary
microtonalists Eric Dolphy, Captain Beefheart and Charles Mingus; and World
Musics from China to Zimbabwe. Plus plenty of (re-)tuning tips for
musicians; how a Neanderthal bone flute proves that JI is the ur-music of
homo sapiens; and a history of Western tuning systems that could mean
you'll never be comfortable listening to any post-Bach music again.  - Rob
Young"

Congrats to John, but how did that cartoon lady, Sally Forth, get in there?

Cheers all,
Jon
