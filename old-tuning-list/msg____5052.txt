Subject: JI Calc 4.41

From: Carter Scholz <csz@well.com>

A new version of JI Calc is on the Mills server as:
ftp://mills.edu/ccm/tuning/mac/jic441.sea.hqx

This is a minor upgrade with the following changes:

- Smarter recovery from READing bad tuning files.
- Faster MIDI transfers than version 4.4.
- Command-click on ratio button to insert a "blank" field into a tuning.
- Minor navigation fix in Lattice Help.
- Non-2/1 repeating octaves sent via MIDI no longer assume that the first 
  ratio in a tuning is 1/1.
- XCMDs recompiled with Think Pascal 4.5d4.
- Cosmetic changes: unnecessary Hypercard menus turned off; "Edit Param" 
  menu item changed to "MIDI Settings"; repeating-octave data moved to 
  card field.
  
JI Calc is a Hypercard stack for creating and archiving musical
tunings, especially in just intonation.  It provides MIDI transfer
of tuning data to instruments that support alternative tunings,
specifically the Yamaha DX-7 E!2, DX7II, DX-11, TX-802, TX-81Z, SY-77,
TG-77, the Emu Proteus series, the Ensoniq EPS series and ASR-10, and the 
MIDI Tuning Spec.  It also plays intervals using Macintosh local sound.
JI Calc is freeware.

This stack requires Hypercard 2.0 or higher.  Sound on PowerMacs
requires QuickTime 2.0 or higher and QuickTime Musical Instruments.
