I agree that "meantone" or, if one wants to be excruciatingly correct, "mean
tone" (the English term for it was first used by Robert Smith in his
_Harmonics._) is easier on the tongue than 2/7 linear.  But as with any
foreign language, it becomes easier with practice...     :)

If I'm not mistaken, I believe that Zarlino himself later admits that it is
inferior to 1/4 linear...

If I understand you correctly, you're referring to 2/7 linear here.  I have
never seen any evidence to suggest that it was even *concidered* by theorists
beyond Zarlino.  There may be an honorable mention by Mersenne, but I'm not
sure.  Certainly not in Germany.  The person to ask would be Edmundo Hora.
If anyone reading this speaks to Edmundo regularly, please tell him to get
on the Net!
