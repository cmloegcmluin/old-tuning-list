<The bridge and nut or fretted fret are trivially nodal points for all

The placement of the sympathetic string's nut beneath the correct fret
serves two purposes (1) allows the symp. sts. to have the same guage, and
(2) allows the player to tune the symp. sts. using the fret above as a
reference. Nifty.
