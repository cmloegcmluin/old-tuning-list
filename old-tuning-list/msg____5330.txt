Subject: Bela Bartok Centre for Musicianship

The Bela Bartok Centre for Musicianship (BBCM) offers specialized aural tra-
ning (including quarter tone pitching), history, analysis, performance skills
and teaching skills. Material of the classes includes music from the renas-
saince to the 20th century. Folksongs of many nations serve as basis. Public
educational concerts form an integral part of the BBCM, whose patrons are Sir
Georg Solti, Sir Charles Mackerras, Norman Bailey CBE, Daniel Barenboim, Radu
Lupu, Professor Reinhard Strohm and Andras Keller. The BBCM presents its next
public educational concert at 4.p.m, Sunday, 16 March in The Steiner Theatre,
35 Park Road, London NW1 6 XT. Apart from its regular classes, the BBCM orga-
nises occasional intensive courses. This year we offer two options: 24-27 July
in London and 20-27 August in Budapest. Both courses will include material 
from regular BBCM classes as well as special presentations on such topics as
various tuning systems, various teaching systems and Bartok^s connection to
ethnic music. Practical music making will form an important part. Tuition fees
are 200 pound sterling (London) and 300 pound sterling (Budapest) respectively.
Both courses are credit bearing for the Trinity College of Music Certificate
and Diploma of Music Education. Application (with a deposit of 50 pounds ster-
ling) is due by 15 May,. For further details please send a stamped addressed
envelope or an international coupon to Agnes Kory, 6 Frognal Court, 158 Fin-
chley Road, London NW3 5HL England or call London 0171 435 3685.
