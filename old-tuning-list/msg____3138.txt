I think I was reacting to the complexities of persuading MIDI
synthesisers to play in "non-standard" tunings.  For simple sounds I
can use samples and Csound to play them at any frequency.  I can play
a set of Bosendorfer piano samples from my MIDI keyboard in real time
(but I am a bad keyboard player).

When I started to use computers for music some years ago I assumed i
would use MIDI.  As it turned out I almost never do, and would rather
synthesise ab initio.

At the time of writing Csound in realtime is almost possible on simple
computers.  It should not be long now.  Until then I will work in
non-real time in order to get the sounds at the frequencies I (think
I) want.
