Steven, thanks for your comments.

This is something I never thought of. Which diminished triad, exactly, 
sounded nice here?

(I know you already told me in e-mail; just thought the rest would like to 
know).

What is interesting here is that in your solution with the diminished triad, 
you circumvent the comma shift by moving one voice a chromatic semitone -- 
but both the comma and the chromatic semitone are represented by 54.5 cents!

Sounds like a good explanation to me. 21.5 cent shifts can happen a lot with 
real instruments.
