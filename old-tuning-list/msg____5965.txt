Subject: Theremax at the Lyric

From: sejic@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu (World Harmony Project Inc.)

I played theremax for a small but appreciative crowd last night at the Lyric
Cafe in downtown Gainesville. The first segment of the program was devoted
to various "special effects", which generated a lot of interest, right away.
After a round of aplause, I then began playing phrases from various melodies
rhat I have heard over the course of my life, including classical, oriental,
popular american and traditional Hawaiian and Italian melodies, in between
improvised episodes that explored the higher numbered segments of the
harmonic and subharmonic series. For a while, I was allowed to play some
quiet, sensitive stuff, but what they seemed to like most  was when I made
really loud building-shaking bass sounds that resembled body noises. In any
case, the entire performance was in just intonation and the audience loved it.



Best wishes,
