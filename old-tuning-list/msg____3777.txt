     I am not sure of what is meant by "extreme" here. {pardon me if I have
totally missed the point}. 
      If something like a Pietro Aaron (1/4 comma), is used, yes that is
extreme for WTC...............
       The other temperments that were being published at the time, ( Peter
Prelleur, Gottfried Keller, and Roger North),  all contained a wide variety
of tempering in the thirds, but no wolf intervals.  
      Amongst the well temperaments, the Werckmiester III is fairly extreme,
but the WTC I goes well in it. (perhaps not on a small, highly inharmonic
piano, but on harpsichords, or 9' concert grands, this temperament is
beautiful).
