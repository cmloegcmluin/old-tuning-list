Agreed!

Unfortunately, real music is more than just an isolated presentation of 
harmonic intervals. Therefore, I do not reach this conclusion. In fact, 
there are many musical considerations which contradict, and need to be 
balanced against, the desire for pure intervals. I chose to reinterpret the 
9-limit example in 41-tet so that I could add notes which would form 
consonances with more of the existing notes than would be possible in just 
intonation (what is often called "punning").
