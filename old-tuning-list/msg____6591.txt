Greetings,  Inre:

      Actually not.  I had posted earlier the difficulty in transferring a
temperament via unison matching of two instruments.  Even though fretted lutes
could be set to ET with some mathematical precision, trying to get a
harpsichord properly tempered by matching the fundamentals to a lute, (not
many overtones in a gut lute string) would only result in a crude
approximation.  I would encourage anyone to try this.  (all you need is a lute
and harpsichord, plus a lotta time. )

      Hmm.  These well temperaments had pure intervals galore!!  the root
tonic thirds in the keys of G, C and F were often tuned purely.  This is a
foundation of the earliest tuning plans.  The Prinz temperament of 1806 uses a
pure C-E third as a benchmark in it's pattern.  Also,  the fifths of the most
remote keys are often left in Just intonation.

    I personally think that the 15 minutes was the time to change meantone
keys, and may not have necessarily needed a change to all notes......  this is
more suspicion on my part than research.

     On the keyboard sonatas?   I really don't agree there, as the development
section of the sonata form seems to have grown with the freedom afforded by
ever-increasing ability to temper the higher keys into a more usable degree of
dissonance.

      On this I must disagree strongly.  Modern day ears can easily hear the
differences in a tuning that provides key character and ET ,which does not.
      The temperament CD uses two different tunings, a Prinz and a Young, and
already I am hearing from people that clearly and profoundly hear the
differences between not only these two, but between the sound of both the well
temperaments there and ET.
       The differences on a harpsichord would be less vivid than on the
Steinway D that we recorded, but 12 ET has it's own, easily distinguishable
sound.
