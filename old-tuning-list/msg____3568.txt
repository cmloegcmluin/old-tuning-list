Subject: Announcement of radio programme

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

On the Dutch channel Concertzender, tomorrow Monday 9 September,
15.30-17.00 h. is the programme 220 Volt with music of Alessandro
Cipriani and Eric Lyon: "1979" and "Tapeworm". Repetition of
28-8-'96.

This is Eric's statement about the works:

"Both pieces come from the same aesthetic which is
to "liberate" music from found sounds from any possible
source including commercially recorded music, originally
recorded sounds and sounds synthetically created on computer.
None of the music is created according to a specific
microtonal scale, although various equal tempered and
just scales are sometimes used as templates for filtering.
The processes I use guarantee that 12 TET rarely if ever
surfaces, but no tuning is systematically applied."
