Subject: Escaping the diatonic hegemony

>>I am on my knees!  You cannot believe this, Paul!  You just can't!  There
>>must be a million and one good ways to escape diatonic hegemony!  That they
>>might not meet the same criteria you use to make 22TET good does not
>>dis-qualify them!

>>MHO, with nothing against your criteria for 22TET.

>I am speaking more in the popularist vein of Gregg Gibson. Yes, I have been
>emotionally moved even by 1/6-tone atonal music (I am thinking of the set of
>improvisations by Steven Lantner and Mat Maneri at the recent Boston
>Microtonal Society event -- a powerful performance where occasional 1/6-tones
>(33 cents) were effectively elevated to the status of autonomous melodic
>intervals -- despite Gregg Gibson's theory). But the vast majority of music
>with popular appeal in this culture is pentatonic or diatonic. There has
>still not been a threat to this status in the West. The decatonic scales of
>22TET have more important properties in common with pentatonic and diatonic
>scales in a Western-style harmonic context than any other scales yet
>described and so represent, in theory, the best chance for an alternative.
>The second-best chance is probably an extended-diatonic chromatic style in
>31-TET that encompasses septimal harmony; 19-TET's septimal harmonies are a
>bit too coarse for me to stomach. By the way, 31-TET played as a scale seems
>to satisfy me that all notes are distinct, but couldn't be any closer without
>losing that property.

>Meanwhile, I go on blissfully playing diatonic/pentatonic music, with
>occasional octatonic excursions amongst my more educated musician friends,
>and feel quite artistically fulfilled. I will truly have to lock myself in a
>room with only 22 someday.
