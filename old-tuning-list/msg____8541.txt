Subject: Unsubscribing

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Dear Tuning,

just to say - this is my last day at work before my trip to USA and Europe. I've 
been picking up the list digest here, and am unsubscribing for now.  

If for some reason the unsubscribe message fails and dumps itself in the digest 
- apologies in advance - I hope someone will unsubscribe me.

If I can obtain a laptop on the trip I'll pick it up again later - otherwise when I 
return in late December.   

Also - sorry that I've been extremely busy recently and unable to sustain as 
many contacts off-list as I would like. 

You can find me at pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk  until October 4 (I leave 
for New York on the 5th).  After that I don't know yet, but I'll at least try to post 
any new address on my website:
