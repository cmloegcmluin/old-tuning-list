Subject: A new way of regarding non-octave
  scales; Jose Wurschmidt's categorization:
  implications for non-octave composition
---
As Erv Wilson has remarked, "The field of
microtonal scales is absolutely infinite."
The closer one looks at any given category
of tunings, the more detail one sees.
This is nowhere more apparent than with
non-octave scales: specifically, that subset
defined by the Nth root of K.
As everyone realizes, non-octave scales are
so new and so unfamiliar to Western ears that
their properties remain largely unexplored. 
While Enrique Moreno (1992) and myself (1989,
1992, 1993, 1995) have made a start, much
theoretical work remains.
One of the more striking characteristics of
non-octave scales is that they often exhibit
a marked disjunction between what Jose 
Wuerschmidt called the "defining interval"
and the "constructing interval."  Indeed, this
perceptual dissonance can be so great in 
non-octave scales as to turn the ordinary rules
of harmony and melody upside-down and inside-
out, and often leads to puzzlement and frustration
among those who hope to compose with Nth roots
of K.
Gary Morrison has alluded to this problem in posts
on his non-octave 13.6363/oct scale (what he 
calls "88 CET," an appelation which while accurate
stresses its defining rather its constructing interval;
and in the case of 13.6363/oct the constructing intervals
are actually the ones with most musical importance).
However I propose to discuss the issue on a more general
basis, covering all Nth roots of K.
First, a word about the terminology.  Jose Wuerschmidt was
a microtonal theorist who did seminal work during the
1920s: his article "Die Quinten- und Terzengewebe" ("The
Web of Fifths and Thirds") had a huge impact on subsequent
thinking about scale generation, and to a large degree 
underlies Rothenberg's, Wilson's, Fokker's and Lucy's
approach to xenharmonics.   (Although they themselves are
often not aware of this; W's ideas diffused far & wide, often at
2nd- 3rd, and 4th-hand.) Wuerschmidt's essential idea
was that tunings are characterized by two kinds of intervals:
one, which he called "constructing intervals," which generate
the tuning via an implied underlying harmonic root progress
and which define the tuning's tonality--and a second kind of
interval, which Wuerschmidt called "defining intervals."
This is the interval which (in what Erv Wilson calls "logarithmic
space," as opposed to "ratio space") linearly defines the melodic
modes of the scale.
In the case of 12-TET, the constructing interval is clearly 2^[7/12].
Underlying this approximation one can reach back to a Pythagorean
(one might say archetypal) constructing interval 3/2, which places
12-TET firmly in the camp of the positive scales. (I.e., those whose
fifths exceed the 3/2 in size. Technically, Bosanquet's positive/negative
classification was originally intended to relate scales to the fifth of
12-TET, as anal-renentive detail-obsessives  will
doubtless point out, but modern usage relates equal tempered
scales to the 3/2. )  Other constructing intervals are equally
plausible: Erv Wilson has generated JI tunings based on cycles
of an interval given by the harmonic mean twixt 4/3 and 11/8,
and he has also generated JI tunings based on cycles of 6/5s and 
5/4s.   One could equally well imagine JI tunings based on cycles
of 7-limit, 11-limit, 13-limit and other constructing intervals;
Johnny Reinhard has generated a tuning based on the squares of
prime numbers.  Other constructing intervals are possible.
Returning to equal-tempered scales, clearly harmonic progressions
other than the 3/2 have been used in other cultures.  The Javanese and 
Balinese do not appear to use a 3/2 at all, nor do the East Indian
srutis.   Even in this culture, some instruments favor the 5/4
rather than the 3/2--as for example vibes. 
In the realm of the Nth roots of K, subdivisions of the 3:1--most
notably the Bohlen-Pierce scale, 13th root of 3--tend to preserve
the 3:1 as a constructing interval when the division is a small
number of scale-steps, but as the number of steps rises, other
constructing intervals can appear (depending on the exact Nth root
of K).
By constrast, the defining interval of 12-TET is the semitone of 
100 cents.  This interval defines the melodic structures,  the leading
tones and modes possible in 12-TET.  Because of the size of the
12-TET defining intervals, many characteristic melodic structures
of antiquity cannot be accurately rendered; in 12-TET there is
no distinction between the diatonic and the chromatic semitones,
for example--nor can the Hellenic enharmonic genus' characteristic
plangent near-quartertone be rendered at all accurately.  The sharped
leading-tone favored by fretless string players (very well rendered
by 17-TET) cannot be faithfully reproduced in 12.  Ditto the string
player's flatted II in the root of a typical I-IV-V-II-I progression.
In fact, string players will tend to make a consistent pitch distinction
twixt II and IIb, while recovering pianists (and other musically
challenged individuals) will perceive no difference between the
two root notes.
However, the defining interval of the 13th root of 3 is the single
scale-step of 146.304 cents, very close in melodic size (and effect)
to a single scale-step of 8-TET.  Thus, while 12-TET uses a
whole-tone very similiar to the familiar tonal 9/8, 13th root
of 3 uses a defining interval not close to anything very tonal.
In fact the scale-step of 13th of 3 is a good approximation to
3 scale-steps of 24-TET, which forms an entirely anti-tonal
interval, lying as it does halfway between one 24-tone circle of
12 fifths and another; again, 146.304 cents is a reasonable counterfeit
of the neutral third formed by the geometric mean between
the 6/5 and 5/4, but again this is hardly a tonal interval in 
the just intonation sense (since 350 cents corresponds to an
irrational number 1.224053543).
Thus 13th of 3 boasts quite tonal harmonic progressions, especially
if one deliberately mis-spells the chords with a 13-scale-steps
3:1 on the outside and a 292.608 2-scale-step third on the inside.
But the melodic defining intervals and thus the modes of 13th of
3 are utterly anti-tonal and inharmonic, and produce an
interesting clash with the constructing intervals.
In the Nth roots of 2, this kind of war twixt defining and 
constructing intervals is rare.  Above 48 tones per octave it
does not exist; and below there are only a few examples. 35-TET
is one example, 26-TET another.  The most notable exemplar is
19-TET, in which the 189.47-cent whole-tone defining interval 
clashes headlong with the very good 694.7368-cent constructing
interval of a fifth, unless purely diatonic progressions are used.
(That strategy quickly wears out its welcome unless the listeners
harbor a particular love for Christmas carols.)
Wendy Carlos' alpha and beta scales are characterized by virtually
just constructing intervals almost bang-on the just 3:2, but their
defining intervals are nothing like the 200-cent approximation of
the 9/8 with which we're familiar. 
Thus the clash twixt defining and constructing intervals must
be considered a particular resource of non-octave Nth root of K
scales.
Moreover, because many Nth roots of K share identical constructing
intervals while boasting entirely different defining intervals,
the adroit scale designer can fix the constructing interval and
generate new scales by searching by alternate Nth roots of K with
a different N but the same K.    
For example, one might decide one wanted a just 5/4.  In that
case one would fix the constructing interval (a chain of 5/4s)
and use a successive set of Ns to generate alternate
non-octave scales and then explore their characteristics.
The most obvious example is of course the set of equal divisions
of the 5/4 ordinally greater than and ordinally less than the 
familiar 4-equal-part division of the approximate 5/4 used
in 12-TET.
Maintaining a just 5/4 and using 5 divisions gives a scale-step
of  [386.31371/5] cents, which yields a non-octave scale of
1200/77.26274 tones/oct = 15.5314 tones/oct.  Using 3
divisions of the 5/4 (one less than the familiar 4, just as we
above explored one more than the familiar 4) we obtain
a scale-step of [386.31371/3] cents, for a non-octave scale
of 1200/128.77123 tones/oct = 9.31885 tones/oct.  In both
cases the constructing interval will be a 5/4, but the defining
intervals are quite different.
One result of this procedure is to generate a family of harmonically
related non-octave scales among which one can "transfer" (to
use Ivor Darreg's, and earlier still, Augusto Novaro's, terminology)
in a non-octave analogy to traditional tonal modulation.  In the
case of standard Western modulation, changing to another key
maintains the defining interval while moving by the constructing
interval; non-octave "modulation" of the kind described above
turns this process on its head by maintaining the constructing
interval but often moving by the defining interval.
Other obvious elaborations abound, but that must be left for
another post.
