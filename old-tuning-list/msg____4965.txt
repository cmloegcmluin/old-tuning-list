As a result of this assumption, most of the tunings that John derives have 
significantly worse major sixths and minor thirds than the ones I derived. 
If one wants these intervals to be smooth just as much as one wants the 
major third and minor sixth to be smooth, including them certainly is 
necessary!

I would like to propose a test so that anyone can decide for themselves 
whether I or John Chalmers have better specified the problem of finding a 
tuning with the best triads. Compare major and minor triads in 15-equal to 
those in 10-equal. The perfect fifth is identical in both tunings. The major 
third is 14 cents sharp in 15-equal, and 16 cents flat in 10-equal. So John 
Chalmers would rate the two tunings as equally good. However, the minor 
third is 4 cents sharp in 15-equal and 44 cents sharp in 10-equal. So I 
would rate 15-equal as much better than 10-equal. Listen for yourself and 
decide!
