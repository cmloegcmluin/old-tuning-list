Subject: Matthieu's _The Harmonic Experience_

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

I spend some time looking at this monumental book yesterday, and it is
quite good. I feel certain that the majority of list members will find
that it strikes many chords with thier own musical understanding, in a
way that has never been succesfully verbalized before. There seems to be
a big hole, namely meantone temperament. But for the most part, the book
is beautiful and honest. The author believes, as I do, that under normal
musical conditions the ear does not recognize harmonic relationships
based on partials beyond the 13th.
