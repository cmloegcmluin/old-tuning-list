Subject: RE: Who's Who in the Tuning discussions

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

There is a list of people compiled by Johnny Reinhard: "Who is who in
microtonality" which appeared in an issue of "Pitch: for the
international microtonalist" several years ago. 

I studied electrical engineering at the Technische Universiteit
Eindhoven from 1981 to 1988. Then I worked for a short while as a
technical assistent at the Sonology Department of the Koninklijk
Conservatorium (Royal Conservatory) in The Hague. There I read among
others Barlow's and Fokker's writings and became interested in
tunings. There was also a computer program that I played with there,
called Archiphone, with which you could play in 31-tET on an Atari
computer keyboard.
Now I work as a system engineer, making software (real-time, C/S,
reusable components, etc.). 
I'm a member c.q. donor of Stichting Huygens-Fokker and attend their
concerts most of the time. 
I have a Yamaha DX7II with E!, an FB-01 and a PC with a soundcard.
I also have a mbira but need to learn to play it.
There's no real single special area of interest in microtonal tuning
that I have. 

I maintain a discography of microtonal music on CD:
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/discs.html
and have put some more stuff in that directory.
