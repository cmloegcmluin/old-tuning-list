Your scale is not that "wild" and only adds a couple of harmonics to a more 
consonant resolution to 12ET.  Objectivity is lost on 12ET-fretted minds 
that are the result of a lifetime of indoctrination.

If you have the conviction of hearing the exact intervals so can any 
professional musician.  If your mind is "muddy" than clear it up.  The 
piano and most electronic timbres are inharmonic, muddying up just 
relationships.  And on the piano, what with the artificial node creating 
a blank space due to the striking hammer, and the bad odds regarding 3 
wires under tremendous tension being exactly in tune...  From where I 
stand keyboards are extremely limited regarding musical expression.  They 
are only a short term fix, except in the hand of extremely talented 
individuals.  There is no reason to believe - at least in theory - that a 
non-keyboard musician that can hear intervals in their head before 
playing them aloud makes an inferior microtonal statement.  And besides, 
music is music and need not aim for "xenharmonic" shock value.

I also find

About 13 years ago I had the opportunity to ask advice about a similar 
problem from the late Issic Asimov.  I had just performed on electric 
bassoon with Jon Catler and The Microtones at The Other End in Greenwich 
Village - the whole set in 31-tone ET.  6 ethnomusicolgist grad students 
that were my colleagues at the time from Columbia University swore that 
they couldn't hear any microtones in our playing.  (This did not give me 
much faith in their ears.)

After a Barnard College lecture on the future, Mr. Asimov responded to my 
frustration at my colleagues.  "Firstly, you are ahead of your time and 
can't expect people to understand what you are doing.  And secondly, keep 
calm about it and be patient with them for in time they will come around.
