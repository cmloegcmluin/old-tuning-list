Subject: "microdoodling" vs. micronoodling

From: PErlich <AAM/AAM/PErlich%0005695065@mcimail.com>

Constructive criticisms of one another's music can have a place on this 
forum, as can reviews which present both "subjective" and "objective" 
aspects of a work. However, taking an overgeneralized, dismissive, and 
patronizing tone towards one's fellow microtonalists is below the level of 
discussion here. Music that touches some people's hearts will leave others 
cold, that's the way it is. Neil, your music is no exception, having heard 
opinions from several members of this list (and having formed my own 
opinion). Subjects that are "quirky" and "vague" to some are relevant and 
clear to others. Neil, the subjects you post about are, again, no 
exception. You are a perfect target for all your own criticisms yet I would
never level them against you. You are passionate about what you do -- 
that's good enough in my book -- there's enough room in this world for all 
our approaches. I would never presume to tell anyone how to direct their 
musical energies unless they came to me specifically for guidance.

The only reason I think about music theory and discuss it on this list is 
because I spend hours every day pouring my heart and soul into making 
music, and seeing how powerfully it can move people (physically, 
emotionally, spiritually). Otherwise it would be as interesting to me as 
toaster engineering. Like you, Neil, I seek to understand the theory 
better, but rather than accept mystical dogmas or ancient doctrines or buy 
into a particular school of thought or drown in the vast sea of 
misinformation, I question everything. If a theory doesn't agree with what 
I hear, than at least one of the assumptions underlying it must be false. 
This is not "fruitless speculation," it is throwing one's entire self, 
including one's mind, into the pursuit of artistic expression. Many of your
own heroes, Neil, had a very cerebral approach to music, but that did not 
get in the way of the reasons they were making music in the first place: 
emotion, communication, spirituality.

Good luck to all of us in our own efforts to create!

P.S. For Doren Garcia, a third category: micropoodling!
