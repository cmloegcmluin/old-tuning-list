   I suppose I should make sure that everybody realizes that I'm not claiming
that 7:4 is in the same interval-size range as 3:2.  I'm speaking here in terms
of its general feeling.  To my ears, it has a lot of the same "steely, cold,
logical, simple" sound that a fifth or fourth has.  It certainly doesn't have
the sweetness of a sixth to my ears.  But in addition to that fifth-like
sensation, it also has that classic septimal zap to it.
