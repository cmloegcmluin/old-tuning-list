>In a recent exchange here, entitled "Pop In Microtones", I had a bit of a
>disagreement with Maestro J. Reinhard's somewhat enthusiastic overview of
>the world. Please be assured, as Johnny and I have 'taken it outside' more
>than once that it's all on a contextual level, with no (none!) enmity.
>Onward...

>Perhaps the greatest mistake is the confusion between "microtonal music"
>and "music containing microtones". At least I believe this to be the crux
>of the problem. I would propose that a music *fundamentally* based on some
>sort of microtonal architecture, in any form, would constitute a piece of
>"microtonal music". This, therefore, excludes musics that *happen to have*
>microtones produced as a side effect, as an addition or coloration or
>ornamentation, or an accident. I believe this to be a very important
>distinction, and the one on which I base the premise that we are very, very
>far, indeed, from a world of microtonal pop music.
>
>After all, if the second schema was the yardstick, then most every
>orchestral concert I've been involved in has been microtonal, at least in
>the general vicinity of the back stands of the second violins...
>
>Johnny had a very telling remark, in response to some of my questions about
>globalization vs. Kenny G, and his ilk:
>
> "The important thing here -- at least to me -- is that there is a
> soup of interval useage out there in the real world of music, and
> that includes pop."
>
>Which only heightens the contrast between the two premises: is it
>microtonal music just because it has a few out-of-tune/in-tune notes? I
>don't believe it is.
>
>So then Johnny, after a shotgun attempt at supplying information to back up
>his claims, tended to reinforce my main point, which was only to keep
>everyone from overheating with joy that the Microtonal Millenium had
>arrived! The facts still exist:
>
>1. Whitney Houston is not a microtonal pop artist.
>
>2. In spite of any analysis, Pink Floyd could not realistically by
>considered as composers/performers of microtonal pop -- because adjusting
>3rds just doesn't overcome the inheirently 12TET underpinnings of the other
>99% of the work.
>
>3. Having microtonal (or microtonally sympathetic) personnel at *some* of
>the stations or print outlets does not constitute mainstream. For heaven's
>sake, NPR? Mainstream? In Jesse Helm's dreams...
>
>The other rationalizations were also similarly weak. I didn't realize that
>the Grateful Dead listened to Ive's 4th before each concert for a year, but
>then I wouldn't ask Gerry Garcia to be my pharmacist based on his other
>interests at the time, either. Not to mention that anyone hoping to peg
>Aaron Copland as a microtonal composer (scattered experimentation
>notwithstanding) is on shaky ground indeed; like he was a great serialist,
>too, huh? Nope. Pretty traditional guy, by just about anyone's standards.
>
>I hope no one took my thoughts on San Diego's microtonal 'scene' in a
>mean-spirited way, I just wanted to make clear that (since we are speaking
>of the present) that it is about as nowhere as most anywhere these days.
>Past history is just that, and no personal slights were intended. Believe
>me: there may be folks living here that know about it, but nobody doin' it.
>
>HOWEVER, JR and I do have one potential common ground with rap. In its
>infancy, with a reliance solely on vocals and rhythm, there was a freedom
>from rigid harmelodic dogma that hadn't been seen in a great while. The
>setting of words that mean a great deal to ordinary people, set
>intervalicly (sp?) more closely to 'real' speech than any piano can
>produce, certainly warmed my heart -- and I'm sure Partch would love it
>too, harkening back to his earliest days of text settings in monophonic
>arrangements (though Harry would have abhorred the violence and brutality).
>Even though the scents of other musical styles are seeping back in, there
>seems to be *much* more fluidity, harmonically and melodically, in the
>vocals of these artists than most any other pop. Of course, that's all been
>co-opted as it became fodder for Sprite commercials, etc. Damn.
>
>Well, anyhow, that's one evenings ruminations. I figure I'm quiet enough on
>the list that I can spew a little occasionally. I like to keep things in
>perspective, yep...

>Hey, on a completely different note(s), if you haven't stopped by Corporeal
>Meadows recently, please do (see the .sig). In the last couple of months
>I've added a few new bits, including a reproduction of a brochure on
>Partch's instruments that he included with the Gate 5 recordings, only (on
>the web site) you can hear the instruments demonstrated.

>Also, Philip Blackburn continues to bring out more material in the
>Innova/Enclosures project, and we're probably just weeks away from the
>first volumes of the CRI Partch Collection.

>Besides, I never get any complaints about my site. I must have gotten
