We've seen that three competing theories
of pitch perception have tried to explain
the ear-brain system since the middle
of the 1840s.  No one model accounts
for all the ear's behaviour, and some evidence
contradicts each hypothesis.
"Protagonists of both place and time theories
point out how small the detectable limits are
when translated into the terms of the other theory.
Temporal [i.e., periodicity] theorists point out that a frequency
discrimination limen of 3 Hz at 1 Khz corresponds
to a shift in the pattern of excitation on the basilar
membrane of 18 microns, or the width of 2 hair cells.
Place theorists point out the that the same limen
corresponds to a time discrimination of 3 microseconds,
as against some 1000 microseconds for the width of a
nerve action potential, and a variability of some hundreds
in its intiation.  (..) There are several lines of evidence
for and against these two theories, none of which is
conclusive." [Pickles, James O., "An Introduction to
the Physiology of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd.
ed., 1988, pp. 271-272.]
At this point it's instructive to step back
and recall that all cultures are conceptually
limited by their experience.  The Cargo Cult
of the South Seas Islands during WW II arose
because the islanders fitted B-17s into
their experience as godlike birds from
a supernatural realm.
In the same way,  the most sophisticated
means of frequency analysis available to
Helmholtz was a set of tuned glass resonators.
By putting his ear to these globes, he could hear
a particular resonant frequency amplified out
of a complex harmonic timbre.  So it was
natural for Helmholz to model the ear/brain
system as a set of millions of tuned
resonators.
As technology advanced during the late 19th
and early 20th century,  high-precision machine
tools became available.  So it was natural for
von Bekesy & others to model the ear/brain system as
a precision machine for performing mechanical
Fourier transforms of complex harmonic sounds.
[For more details on these hypotheses, see:
Helmholtz, "On the Senations of Tone," 1863;
Plomp, R. "The ear as a frequency analyzer," JASA,
1964, vol. 36, pp. 1628-1636;  Boomsliter & Creel,
"The Long Pattern Hypothesis of Pitch and Harmony,"
Journ. Mus. Theory, Vol. 5, 1961, p. 1-12; von
Bekesy, G. "Concerning the Fundamental Component
of Periodic Pulse Patterns and Modulated Vibrations
Observed on the Cohlaer Model with nerve Supply,
JASA, Vol. 33, 1961, ppg. 888-896; von Bekesy,
"Three Experiments Concerned with Pitch
Perception," JASA, Vol. 35, pp. 602-606, 1963;
von Bekesy, G. "Hearing Theories and Complex
Sounds," JASA, Vol. 35, pp. 588-601, 1963;
Licklider, J.C. R. : "Periodicity Pitch and Related
Auditory Process Models," Intern. Audiol. Vol. 1,
pp. 11-36, 1962.]
 Then  in the 1940s and 1950s computers became
available, and with them software.
So it became natural for modern researchers to
model the ear/brain system as a combination
of hardware and software, with software
performing the crucial functions of pitch
detection, perception of consonance, dissonance,
etc.  Thus we now see papers like: Goldstein, J.R.
 "An optimum  processor theory for the central formation of the
pitch of complex tones," JASA, 1973, Vol. 54, pp.
1496-1616; Wightman, F. I. "The pattern-
transformation model of pitch," JASA, 1973,
vol. 54, pp. 407-416.
So what do we have?
Quite possibly, a series of cargo cults.
 The ear/brain system is viewed
by each era in terms of the most convenient
available paradigms, regardless of whether
those paradigms are actually appropriate.
In an interview with Curtis Roads, Max Mathews
summarized all 3 theories of hearing with
typical elegance and pith: "In a book first published
in 1863, Helmholtz proposed that dissonance
arises from unpleasant beats between partials
whose drequencies are too close together. [4] The
octave is the most consonant of intervals because
all of the partials of the upper coincide in frequency
with partials of the lower tone. (...) Rameau had
another view of harmony. [6] He observed that
in a major triad all frequencies present are integer
multiples of a basse fundamentale or fundamental
bass which, in the root position of the chord (C, E, G)
lies two octaves below the root of the chord. (...)
But, one might hold that musical harmony is merely
a matter of brainwashing; that we accept combinations
of tones that we have been taught are correct, and
reject those that we have been taught are incorrect.
We have some experimental evidence that bears on
this." [Mathews, M. and Pierce, J.R. "Harmony and
Non-Harmonic Partials," Rapports IRCAM, 1980, pp. 3
-5]
The above passage describes clearly the 3
different competing hypotheses of hearing
still competing even today: namely,  [1] that
the ear is a frequency-domain Fourier analyzer;
[2] that the ear is a time-domain autocorrelator;
[3] that the ear/brain system uses a learned
neural net system of pitch/interval recognition
and consonance/dissonance classificiation.
The contradictory results of experiments on
pitch sensation lead to the conclusion that
some aspects of all of these 3 models of human
hearing bear some relation to the ear/brain
system's actual operation.  However, because
some of the experimental results are contradicted
by each of these 3 models of hearings,  it
is inescapably clear that under various
circumstances one or more of these ear/brain
hearing systems becomes dominant, and in
some cases (particularly in the case of
auditory illusions) all 3 of the ear/brain
systems can clash and yield conflicting
results.
These  3 separate hypothetical mechanisms
for processing  both vertical and horizontal
(sequential) pitch are: [1] a frequency-based or
Fourier analysis system; [2] a time-based or
autocorrelative system; [3] ear/brain "wetware"
that includes a strong learned component,
and which is capable of actively filtering
out auditory information, creating illusory
auditory information, and transforming some
or all of the information conveyed from the
basilar membrane and the hair cells  to the auditory
nerve, and from there into the Sylvian fissure,
the superior medial olive and the geniculate
nucleus--all areas in the brain responsible
for dealing with aspects of auditory perception.
This last point is important, because it is now
known that musicians and non-musicians use
different brain centers when hearing the same
music.  Musicians show glucose metabolism
primarily in the left brain when listening to
music, while non-musicians show glucose
metabolism both brain hemispheres.
These PET scan results offer strong
confirmation of the third model of hearing--
what Mathews and Pierce call the "brainwashing"
hypothesis, the model of hearing as molded by
learned response (first put forward by Fetis and
Alexander J. Ellis in the middle of the 19th century).
While the Fourier analysis model of the ear/brain and
the autocorrelative (or periodicity pitch) model
have been extensively documented, what
about experiments documenting the "wetware"
component of the ear/brain system?
Auditory illusions provide strong evidence

system: Shepard, R. N., "Circularity in

Why are these 3 models of ear/brain function
important to musicians in the real world?
They're of crucial concern to microtonalists because
if the place theory is right, then just intonation is
the ideal tuning.  If the periodicity theory is the
correct description of how the ear hears, then
many tunings are acceptable provided that the
interval between the fundamental and the first
partial, and twix each subsequent pair of partials,
is larger than the critical band at that frequency.
As Pickles points out, the periodicity theory does
*not* offer support for conventional Western
musical practice: "It might be thought that the
pleasant consonance of simple musical intervals
depends on the simple relations between their periods,
resulting in synchronous nerve firing.  However,
once it is realized that most musical notes are
rich in overtones, and that consonance might depend
on a lack of beats between the harmonics, the
argument cannot be used to support the importance
of time information." [Pickles, James O., "An Introduction
To the Physiology of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd ed.,
1988, pg. 274]
On the other hand, if Fetis/Ward/Burns' "pattern
recognition" hypothesis of the ear as a pliable active
feedback system molded by learned response is the true
picture of human hearing, then *any* type of tuning is
acceptable.  After a while, the listeners will
become acculturated and learn to accept *any*
arbitrary interval as "consonant" or "dissonant."
And what if elements of all three models are
at work in the ear/brain system?
In that case, the implications for musical tuning
are more complex--a situation which will be
considered in the next post.
