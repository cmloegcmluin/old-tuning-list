It is also well documented that stretched octaves are preferred to just 
octaves. But all these studies tend to focus of melodic rather than harmonic 
intervals, or else tones with weak harmonics. The fact that "stretched" 
intervals are preferred to just intervals in a context where beating between 
partials is not the most prominent determinant of consonance may indicate 
that Terhardt's hypothesis about a "stretched" harmonic template is correct. 
The ear, when presented with a multiplicity of pure tone components (in 
Parncutt's version, the prenatal ear hearing the mother's voice), is known 
to slightly stretch the intervals between them, and one hypothesis is that 
this stretching is "expected" even when a meager stimulus is presented. 
Goldstein studied the precision with which frequency information is 
transmitted by the brain's central pitch processor by measuring residue 
("virtual") pitches produced by two pure tones, but I think his approach 
assumed symmetrical errors and did not pay attention to systematic biases in 
the allowable mistuning of the pure tones. I wonder if such a study would 
reveal that judgments of harmonic relationships are easier to make when the 
distances are stretched somewhat. In any case, it may be a case of the 
archers aiming for the bullsye, but a steady wind blowing the arrows off 
course. The aesthetic of stretched intervals must be somewhat compromised in 
practice: phenomena such as second-order beating and combination tones can 
be disturbing for significant departures from harmonicity.

The "small integers" concept of consonance that McLaren "disproves" is a 
rather extreme, Partchian version. Which is more consonant, 300001/200000, 
or 11/9? While the former clearly involves larger integers, it is also very 
close to 3/2, and is likely to be heard as such. He also extends the small 
number theory to chords of more than two notes, where the use of frequencies 
vs. periods can determine which chord is calculated to be more consonant. 
Observe:

Frequencies:

Major - 4:5:6
Minor - 10:12:15
Suspended - 6:8:9

Periods:

Major - 10:12:15
Minor - 4:5:6
Suspended - 6:8:9

Using either frequencies or periods, the suspended triad comes out in 
between major and minor; the fact that the suspended triad is more dissonant 
is related to the fact that when the intervals are looked at individually, 
it requires higher numbers. Moreover, McLaren seems to love neutral thirds 
and hate tritones; I have to strongly disagree with his consonance judgments 
here. But consonance is a very subjective judgment, and the art of 
composition can be just as effective (or more so) when based on flawed or 
subjective premises. . . .
