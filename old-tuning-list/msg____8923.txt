Subject: two suggestions for the promotion of tuning

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I have two suggestions for the promotion of tuning to broader musical
communities. =


The first is that the continuous invention and proliferation of new
terminology (and the ensuing conflicts over definitions) is self-defeatin=
g.
Most of the ideas we are engaged in can be discussed without inventing ne=
w
terms and most ordinary musicians are turned aback by the mass of
terminology we tend to throw to them. =


The second idea is that we should be  more relaxed about notations. To ru=
n
a riff on Korzybski, notations are not the sounds themselves, and no matt=
er
how convenient a particular notation may be, no single notation is
neccessary. For example, attempts to standardize Just intonation with
Johnston's or my own or some other notation should be discouraged in favo=
r
of getting players to think flexibly about pitch in general. Flexible
notational will only follow from such a precondition. As another example,=

the continuous claims for priority in graphing techniques on this list
don't lead anywhere (or at least anywhere previously unvisited by Riemann=

or Tanaka or Wilson...). As some one has recently pointed out,
triangulating a lattice is an obvious idea (as it was to Tanaka a century=

ago).
