   I suspect that Neils' and some others' response to that would be, "but
REALLY GOOD improvisation doesn't sound like just noodling around".  

   I personally would be inclined to both agree and disagree.  I find that
the best usage of improvisation is in live performance, more so than in
recorded performance.  I say that because in that scenario, you can
actually react to the audience ("oooh, they liked that lick;  I'll expound
upon it a bit").
