Dave, I thought you were being prudent. Even though Denver is big enough
to have nasty criminals (I have a bullet hole in my bathroom window) I
had not considered the possibility of robbery based on a nice internet
shopping list of instruments, and I think it was sensible to remove
the names. Your new idea about e-mail addresses is good, so in the
interest of maintaining a useful archive of microtonal instruments, I
will attach an e-mail address at the beginning of each entry should the
owner of the instruments desire it. Just clip the first line of your
entry, mail it to me at jstarret@math.cudenver.edu and I will affix your
email address (and any other information you desire, including your name,
if you wish) thereunto . Also, I am sure some list members know the location
of other microtonal instruments, perhaps in a museum or university studio.
I would love to post these instruments also, so if you know about any other
unlisted instruments, please pass them along.

I just signed on to Neil's tuning forum compilation project. I think it
is a great idea.
