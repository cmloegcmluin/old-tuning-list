Well, the thing about the generalized keyboard as Wendy and I envision
it 8-)> is that every single key (excepting octave equivalents) is set
at a slightly different height.  An invariant pitch relationship
between notes maps to an invariant spatial relationship between keys.
Thus, you have whole-tone scales sloping gently up and to the right,
and so on.  I don't see how to do that by stacking standard keyboards.
