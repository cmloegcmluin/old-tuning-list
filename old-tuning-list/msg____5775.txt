How so?  The way I larnt it, a simple C major triad in root position consists
of a minor third stacked on top of a major third.  In first inversion, it
consists of a perfect fourth stacked on top of the minor third.  In second
inversion it's that perfect fourth with the major third stacked above it.
 From what perspective are those the same set of intervals?

I don't quite follow all that, especially the "privileged root" part, with
which concept I am unfamiliar.  Could you give an example?

To my great surprise, I am increasingly inclined to agree with you on that.
 After all, orchestrators and arrangers have known the importance of
appropriate "voicing," or spacing of intervals across octaves, for about as
long as there has been 4-part harmony.
