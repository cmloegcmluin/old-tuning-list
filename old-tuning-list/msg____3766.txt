This seems an opportunity for a clever algorithm to minimise that
effect. It will need as many MIDI channels as the user can spend for
each voice. It could select used channels on a least recently used
basis except where it can take advantage of occurrences of notes that
are multiples of 100 cents different from some previous note in which
case it can reuse a channel without changing the pitch bend value.
The algorithm could also trade off between selecting the channel that
would need the smallest pitch bend change from the previous note and
taking the channel which has the lowest volume. It would need to
know the voice parameters for that of course. It might also fiddle
with the moments of note-off messages if a decaying tone would
otherwise be audibly detuned. 
Has anyone done something like this?
The unproblematic case is if one has only one voice and a fixed octave
based scale of 16 tones or less, the pitch bends can be set for each
channel at the beginning.
