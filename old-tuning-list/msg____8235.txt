I don't have full details of Java Sound, but I bet it won't allow
low-level access to the MIDI ports.  I wrote my Windows program in C++.  I
don't know much about Macintosh, but I'm sure the same thing could be done
for it.  Unfortunately, graphical and multimedia code is highly machine
specific, so I can't do a quick conversion.

What's "Megalomania" then?
