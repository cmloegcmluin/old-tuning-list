Subject: Re: South Dakota Microtones

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Just back after a week lecturing on microtones at South Dakota Stae 
University in Brookings.  My 4 lectures (outlined in a previous post) 
were written about in 2 papers and attended by the Freshman-Sophomore 
music classes.

The students regularly surprised the faculty by their astute attention to 
the issues discussed; by their willingness to "sing" aloud - 
microtonally, of course; and expecially by the non-jazz improvisation by 
8 students in their orchestral hall.

Reminding me somewhat of the openness I experienced in Denver during 
MicroStock I, I found South Dakotans accepting microtonality at face 
value.  The _Shrine to Music_ in Vermillion, SD has a huge building 
devoted to musical instruments, proud of its Stradivarious violin and 2 
Strad guitars (10 string).  It also has a Janko-keyed microtonal piano 
and the cello-Termin, a theremin cello that specializes in the playing of 
"quarter-tones and micro-tones" (as it says on the card next to it.

Professor Anthony Lis, director of the 9th Annual New Music Festival in 
Brookings says "It is important for our students to see first hand what 
is happening in music" and felt at the end that "people will be talking 
about this for a long time to come."  :)
