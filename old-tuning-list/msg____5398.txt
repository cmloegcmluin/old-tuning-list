Subject: Xenharmonikon web site has moved (slightly)

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

The Xenharmonikon web site has been restructured and moved (slightly).
The new URL is as follows:

    http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/xh/

Please update your links and bookmarks to point the new address.  I have
also spiffed up the graphics on the XH pages and added navigation bars.
Hope you all like the new format.

I never formally announced the addition of the XH Errata page last
summer -- but it is indeed there (many thanks to Manuel Op de Coul for
sending info on many of the errors).  If anyone knows of any other
errors in XH that are not included on the Errata page, please send them
to me for verification and inclusion.

John
