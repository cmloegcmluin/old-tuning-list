>On Friday, November 7, at 7:30 PM, Harmonic Arts and the School of
>Healing Arts, 159 W.25 th St., New York City are proud to present
>internationally acclaimed composer, singer, and meditation music pioneer
>David Hykes in a rare New York solo appearance, entitled ?the universe
>of harmonic chant, an integral sound yoga.?   Hykes, who has lived in
>France since 1987, is a principal pioneer in the ?chant? and ?healing
>sounds? movement worldwide. The founder of  the harmonic chant  with his
>group, the Harmonic Choir,  Hykes was the first Western artist to study
>and spread awareness of the Tibetan, Tuvan and Mongolian styles of chant
>often called ?throat-singing,? in which a singer produces both a
>fundamental note and soaring harmonics from the note?s harmonic series.
>(Harmonics, or overtones, are to musical sound what the pure colors of
>the spectrum are to light.)
>
>Hykes will present a concert program of his works for harmonic chant,
>accompanied by percussionist Robert Mann,  followed by a participatory
>workshop, ?harmonic source teachings,? devoted to this contemplative
>chant practice he has developed over the past 22 years. The harmonic
>chant combines innovative use of the monophonic and polyphonic resources
>of Western chant with an original approach to the vibratory mathematics
>of vocal harmonics, taken as ?the DNA of melody, harmony and rhythm.
>
>Hykes and his group, the Harmonic Choir, were Artists-in-Residence at
>the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York for  ten years, where
>he participated in the first-ever joint concerts with the Gyuto and
>Gyume monks.   Hykes began his exploration of the realm of sacred chant
>in Mongolia, Tibet and Tuva at the age of 21; in New York  in 1975 he
>founded the Harmonic Choir , the first western group devoted to
>performing original overtone-based chant and singing.  Pioneers in the
>field of contemporary sacred world music, Hykes and his Choir were the
>first Western musicians to deeply explore new possibilities for vocal
>music based on harmonics. A new sacred art both  contemplative and
>dynamic, Hykes? s harmonic chant has been performed to great acclaim
>with the Harmonic Choir and in solo performances in some 25 countries
>since 1975.   Invited  to France by the French Ministry of  Culture in
>1987, Hykes has worked with theater director Peter Brook and founded an
>international music center, near Paris. Hykes has contributed music to
>many films, including ?Meetings with Remarkable Men,? ?Ghost,? ?Dead
>Poets Society? and ?Baraka.? The 8th ?David Hykes and the Harmonic
>Choir? CD has just been released, entitled ?Breath of the Heart? (Fonix
>Music, Denmark; US distributor: White Swan, Boulder, Colorado).
>
>Founded by Hykes in 1979,  the Harmonic Arts Society was  the first
>cultural  organization in the western world devoted to ancient and
>modern vocal music based on harmonics. HAS has organized many
>cross-cultural projects, including an evening Hykes co-hosted with the
>Dalai Lama.
>
>Tickets for the full evening are $40 (concert/presentation only, $20)
