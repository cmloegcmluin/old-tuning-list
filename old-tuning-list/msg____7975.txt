Subject: Re: magic chord

From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu>

I seem to recall having offered this chord (1/1 5/4 7/5 7/4) some time
back as a small-integer-ratio "interpretation" of the French sixth
chord.  Since the 225/224 vanishes in my fave, 31TET, it works in that
tuning as well--in fact, I'm beginning to realize that the 225/224 may
be as significant in my septimal messing about as the 81/80 is to the
diatonic scale.
