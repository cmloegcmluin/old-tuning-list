Notation is, to me, a topic on equal footing with visceral topics in the
tuning discussion, since I believe that microtonality will never become
widespread nor will it develop a significant repertoire without some kind
of standard notation.  When a standard is established, then music can be
raised to the level of sonic discourse, just as the emergence of Western
common practice music was marked first by the establishment of our standard
notational system, followed by the development of standard forms like the
da capo aria, sonata form, symphony, and other frameworks upon which
composers can comment and impress their own styles.

In this regard, the notation debate ties in strongly with last year's "what
is JI" thread, a heated topic which emphasized our divergent styles and
approaches across the world of tuning.  Don't get me wrong--I don't think
that all music should be homogenized for the sake of so-called "progress",
but it is aparrent that when people band together, great things can happen.
We don't need to worry about this; it will happen effortlessly as long as
we continue to pass around tapes and books.  What we should work on is
continuing the innovation and the debate about how to create a musical
framework and notation which will accommodate the widest range of styles,
and adopt it as "standard".  Then, the next wave of innovators can exand
upon it and take the next step.
