Re: Wolves

If I am correct, (and I have known to be wrong <G>) I believe that the
term "wolf" was originally used because the beating of an out-of-tune
interval was perceived to sound like the growling of a wolf.  It this is
true, than any out-of-tune interval which produces beating fast enough to
"growl" (and I guess everyone would have to decide for themselves just how
much tolerance they have for beating) would be a wolf.  

And for me, that includes major thirds in equal temperament.  (Especially
in the tenor octave!)

There are WOLVES EVERYWHERE!
(Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that they're NOT out to get
you.  I mean, even hypochondriacs REALLY get sick!)
