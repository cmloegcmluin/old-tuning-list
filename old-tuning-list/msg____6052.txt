On the evidence I've got, which is purely the modes Manuel put on
this list as well as the FTP site, I wouldn't say that a schisma
is even theoretically 1 sruti.  As it took me a while to sort this
out, I'll share my thoughts with the list.

First, the sruti scale I'm using is:

        s p r p s p r p s|p r p s|s p r p s p r p s

With s a limma, r a chromatic semitone and p a syntonic comma.  I
think these work out as:

                  (s)   ( 8 -5 0)
                  (r) = (-3 -1 2)H
                  (p)   (-4 4 -1)

Setting a schisma=0 means s=p+r.  Setting a diaschisma=0 means s=r.

Most of the scales work as 5-limit harmony with the just version
of this scale.  In some cases the schismic and diaschismic
approximations both work.  The following scale doesn't make sense
to me:

3 2 4 3 2 4 4   Gandhaara Grama (Sarngadeva der. ma-grama)

I suggest that Pa should be flat by p rather than s, so that the
interval of 3 steps separating the tetrachords is a minor tone.
Either this uses a different version of the sruti scale, or it is
assumed that people will guess the correct tuning.  Or, my
interpretation is wrong.


This scale works as a diaschismic but not a schismic scale:

2 6 1 4 2 6 1   Raga Bhairav

I'm assuming the intervals of 6 steps should be just minor thirds,
but I have no proof of this.


I think the following scales imply schismic tuning:

1 4 6 2 1 7 1   Raga Todi
1 7 1 4 2 2 4 1 Raga Saurastra
1 4 7 1 1 6 2   Raga Varali

The intervals of 7 steps aren't right for diaschismic major thirds,
so I'm assuming they should be schismic minor thirds.  The upper
tetrachord of Varali suggests the same _diaschismic_ approximation
as in Bhairav above!  That's consistent with the sruti scale being
a kind of well temperament with no single interpretation.
Because the tonic is always sruti 0, you don't have to worry
about transpositional invariance, so this sort of thing is
allowed.  Then again, the 6 steps could denote a Pythagorean
minor third (5 -3)H.


There are also some that may have 7-prime-limit intervals.  The
following is the only one that doesn't work schismically:

4 2 4 3 3 3 3   Gandhaara Grama (Narada der. sa-grama)

The middle of the three 3's is 2s+p.  This can't be a minor tone.
I suggest it should be the interval (-1 1 1 -1)H or 15/14.  It
can be better represented as either r+r+p or s+p.  The two are
identical in a schismic temperament, and the former is the
diaschismic equivalent of 2s+p.  One of the other 3's will be
(2 0 -2 1)H to compensate.  It's also possible that all the 3's
are supposed to be roughly equal intervals, and no 7-limit
interpretation is intended.
