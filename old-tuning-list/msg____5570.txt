From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I assume that the cent values in the program represent the following
ratios:

C = 0  = 1/1
C# = -29 = 25/24
D = +4  = 9/8
D# = +16 =  6/5
E = -14 = 5/4
F = -2 = 4/3
F# = -10 = 45/32
G = +2 = 3/2
G# = +14 = 8/5
A = -16 = 5/3
A# = +18 = 9/5
B = -12 = 15/8

Perhaps someone initiated into the deeper mysteries of the Kurzweil concern
could give a source (recording or scholarly) for this in Tibetan music.

Assuming that c is the ''tonic'', the 25/24 is certainly surprising unless
it's used as the fifth harmonic of a. My experience of Tibetan music has
been that of an intonationally flexible affair, with the instruments often
using very different tunings (with beats between instruments common) and
the voices adjusting their choice of melodic pitches to instrumental
reference pitches and perhaps to pitches found in harmonic spectra (i.e.
sometimes using a lower neighbor tone around an 8/7 below the reciting
tone).

The best scholarship, by the way, on Tibetan music, is that of Ter
Ellingson. (In fact, all previous work in the field is superseded). Tuning,
however, does not feature in Ellingson's work.    Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
