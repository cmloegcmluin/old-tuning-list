Subject: good posts

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...a recent post looking at rhythmic structures was
great...I don't think I've ever seen this vital subject mentioned on
this forum, at least in such a dynamic way...as a long time blues
guitarist, I know that messing with the time is a very natural part
of the blues (and jazz) genres, and that subtle pushes and pulls on
where the time is over a 12/8 blues rhythm is absolutely killer...the
way Albert King bends his notes it feels like he's dragging a bit;
this, of course, is very deliberate and sets up a powerful tension;
when he finally resolves to the 1, it's like a bomb dropping on your
head. Again, I'm one to always approach this stuff from a more intui-
tive point of view...yet, I do have a pretty good intellectual under-
standing of how this translates to other concepts as well, especially
math and number theory.
Also, the recent surge of posts regarding performance and content of
concerts involving microtonal music is a very good sign...it's time,
I feel, to make some changes in the structure of Western music, but
on a real practical level...there's some mighty baaaad 12 tone players
out there, and we need to catch up. We seem to have success in Denver
with other tuning systems because we've managed to simply make it a part
of the music scvene here...for example, the music school I teach at
juct booked me on 2 different gigs, one a kid's concert (I write
children's songs) and the other at a local New Year's Eve celebration
that gets tons of press, where I am billed as "microtonal guitar";
in other words, it's becoming integrated in a very basic way with
my other gigs, which is, I believe, exactly what we need to accomplish
if 12 tone is to get it's butt kicked. And, I think Reinhard is a hoot,
a great and entertaining musician...his wife Mayumi is a monster com-
poser, using a beautiful 13 limit tuning of her own devising. They
are not included in my definition of microdoodling...
