Here's my problem with that: the 28:25 is represented in 31TET by 193.5
cents, and that interval by itself doesn't really evoke a consonant 9:8.
If one really hears intervals at the 9-limit or higher, then both 9:8
and 10:9 must be considered consonant, and there should be a dissonant
point about halfway between them. 193.5 cents is awfully close to that
dissonant point. There are many chords in 31TET where the 9:8 is clearly
evoked, because other ratios are supporting that interpretation. But in
this chord, that doesn't happen.

The chord doesn't sound too bad in 31tET, but I would argue that that
has nothing at all to do with the vanishing of the 225/224. Instead,
it's that the five consonant intervals are tuned extremely well in
31tET.
