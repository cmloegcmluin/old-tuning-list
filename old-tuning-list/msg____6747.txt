I agree.  I find that the 7/6 juices up minor 7th chords, not to mention
providing the 7/4 for the 4^7 chord.

Good adjectives.  I'd like to also remind of the way harmonic intervals work
with their buddies.  The 9/7 behaves quite a bit differently in a plain dyad
than it does in a 4,5,6,7,8,9 chord.

I'd never thought about this before, but it is so true.  It has that
"square" feeling I always associate with the 3:2.

>But unlike any perfect interval, it has a flourescent "zap" much like
7:6's, >which is the "attitude" part.

damn straight.
