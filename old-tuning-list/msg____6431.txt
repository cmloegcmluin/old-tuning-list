I do not have the contacts in Prague but the players of the enahnced
clarinets would certainly have vital information.  As I understand it, the
players exchange their A and Bb clarinets for the quartertone ones.  I'm
sure they have importants opinions based on their personal experiences.
Check with the Czech opera in Prague and talk to the clarinetists in the
orchestra about who has experience with the extra-keyed versions.

Pardon me, I meant "thorough."  The advent of keys to woodwinds has been a
boon to expressivity.  Certainly, it allowed for playing in more keys than
those without.  The fingerings on bassoon allow for absolutely any pitch
frequency (except perhaps for the lowest tetrachord, which has the least
available combinations of keys).

When asked which instrument is the hardest by a young, naive individual.
The honest answer is that they are all equally hard in the long run.
While a harp string is easy to pluck, this easy challenge is compounded
later on by the rapidity of of multiple harp simultanaities, artistically
rendered...and invariably by memory.

I honestly think it's not that hard to learn microtonal playing on
conventional instruments.  And that if there is was even a little bit of
emphasis on microtonal playing, as well as ear training, and historical
development in the schools -- across the board -- it would be accepted
right now as a mere matter of fact.
