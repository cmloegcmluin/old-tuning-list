'' It must be said, though it partially supports Matt's viewpoint, that

cultures (the West, India, Arabia) seem to have discovered the 5-limit 
relations through their SCHISMATIC, not SYNTONIC, approximations. It seems 
that Pythagorean tuning was extremely well developed long before any 
theoretical understanding of the 5-limit came about.''

and:

'' Ptolemy's scales (much like his astronomical models) seem to have been 
derived from geometrical and mystical, not scientific (the appropriate 
science for music is psychoacoustics), considerations, so they don't count.
''

Response:

You can't have it both ways. There are alternative readings of the
historical materials, but the most convincing rationale for the use of
schismatic approximations of intervals with five as a factor would be a
doctrinal or mystical commitment to a three limit. (And, in practice, most
Saz players correct their schisma-off thirds to 5-limit ratios). That
Ptolemy would go beyond the three limit in his tunings was contrary to the
prevailing neo-pythagoreanism, and, among the classical harmonicists,
Ptolemy is probably farthest from any such mystical tradition. In fact, his
_Harmonics_ is virtually the only classical source to clearly discern
between theoretical and actual tunings. The remainder of the remark,
criticising Ptolemy on the basis of the superior propriety of a discipline
(Psychoacoustics) which would wait until the late 19th century to be
established (in Leipzig), and whose scope and dimensions were well ouside
of the scientific discourse of Ptolemy's time is, simply, ridiculous.

As to the historical priority of a three-limit in music theory (given
Assyrian and Chinese evidence), I assume this is true, but the advent of
work with a monochord (and the entire discipline of harmonics) is not
characterised by an innocence towards higher prime numbers. I would suggest
that the prior three-limit theories were not constructed with such
innocence but in full comprehension of the fact that additional primes were
not going to create any systemic closure, and that factors of three were
sufficiently complex to generate a large supply of useable tones, thus the
''mystical'' attributes of the number three were a - for us -
comprehensible recogition of real mathematical and musical properties,
while not explicitly condemning the introduction of higher primes - which
may very well have been part and parcel of the actual musical practice.
