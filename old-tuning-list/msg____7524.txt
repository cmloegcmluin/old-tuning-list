Nonoctave equal temperaments are not a problem.  I gave examples of Carlos
alpha, beta and gamma and Bohlen-Pierce at my web site.  Because of the
skipped key, however, I'm not sure you could accomplish this scale on a
K2000/K2500.  It might be possible to adjust the pitch every nth key using a
quantize function, but I'd need a better understanding of your scale to do
this, such as a mapping from MIDI note number to cents for the entire
keyboard.  I'm not sure where the successive gaps will occur since your
scale is non-octave repeating and the G#/Ab of the first octave is not the
same as the other octaves.

So what is the minimum pitch resolution that is acceptable?  Is this for
music comprised mostly of long sustained harmonies?
