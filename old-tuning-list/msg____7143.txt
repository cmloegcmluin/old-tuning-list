Subject: Fw: PARTCH collection must relocate (fwd)

From: Adam Silverman <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

>PARTCH COLLECTION SEEKS NEW HOME
>
>The legendary Harry Partch instrument collection, currently housed at
>the Purchase (New York) College Conservatory of Music, is desperately
>seeking a new home.
>
>Dean Drummond, Artist-in-Residence at the College Conservatory and
>custodian of the Partch instrumentarium, says he has been given notice
>that the school will no longer provide space for the huge collection as
>of Fall 1998.
>
>These magnificent instruments were hand-crafted by Partch (1901-1974),
>and his compositions can only be performed on these unique 43-note
>instruments.
>
>"We'd be willing to move to most major cities in the United States or
>Europe," said Drummond. "However, if I leave the New York metropolitan
>area, a paid position must be part of the deal. We're looking for an
>institution that thinks that preserving Partch's legacy is essential,
>and for whom providing such a space isn't an inconvenience."
>
>The minimum space needed is 1900 sq. ft., of which at least 1300 sq. ft.
>must be one room in which all the instruments could be arranged for
>rehearsals. Reasonably large doors and access to load-in/load-out are
>also essential.
>
>"Ideally," Drummond explained, "I am interested in moving to an
>institution dedicated to participating in the production of major
>multi-media works by Harry Partch; commissioning and performing new
>works for the instruments; recording; and training a new generation of
>composers and performers in the growing language of microtones."
>
>Please contact Dean Drummond directly at:
>email: <drummond@purchase.edu>
>Office: 914-358-2759
>Studio: 914-251-6887
