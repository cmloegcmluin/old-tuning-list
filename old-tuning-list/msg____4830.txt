Subject: laws and the cost of books

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Haverstick here...the way I define laws, in a Universal sense, is that 
which IS...science is certainly capable of examining and perhaps 
explaining certain things, but gets pretty goofy when it tries to 
understand the Creator in those same terms. As we all know, physics is 
getting into some pretty weird corners, from which I feel there is 
nowhere to turn.
If one wants to create one's own tuning, ot theory thereof, that is a 
very admirable undertaking, and I respect anyone who tackles such a 
project. I do believe, however, that there ARE some basic Laws of Music, 
which have nothing to do with anything the human race thought of, or 
created; I want to find out what those Laws are, and the study of tunings 
is my path...it is a deep one.

There's also a big difference between personal experience and a theory; 
to me, there is not "your" God, or my "God" there IS a higher Power, to 
use a cliched term, and He/She is the same, regardless of what any human 
thinks or theorizes. To EXPERIENCE this Creator is, indeed, another 
story, and for me is intimately connected to my music. I am not into 
music or tunings just to theorize; I am a player, and that is where the 
music lives, in the playing, not the talking.

I definitely think that $300 buckeroos is too steep, especially for a 
book that is about, to me anyway, just another man made tuning...there's 
a ton of them, but they all deviate from what I call pure tunings. Again, 
what effect this may have, in a vibrational sense, perhaps we do not yet 
know....maybe this is a subject that needs to be talked about more. I am 
mighty curious if Mr. Lucy walks the walk, or just talks the talk. I've 
often found that theory knowledge, and the real shit, do not necessarily 
go hand in hand. I would be ecstatic if Lucy's music kicks my ass; 
perhaps he could let us know how to get ahold of his recordings...Hstick
