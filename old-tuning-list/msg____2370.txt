Subject: JI Calc & WAV to MIDI

From: William Echard <wechard@yorku.ca>

I've been trying to FTP JI Calc, but the old addresses don't seem to
work for me anymore :-(  Can someone tell me where to find it?
     Also, I've been wondering if anyone has created a PC version of
the melograph, i.e., something that will read a sound file and provide
a continuous graph of pitch & loudness?  Similarly, I'm wondering if
anyone knows of a program that will give an *interactive* graphic
representation of a fourier analysis, so you can point the mouse and 
get the data for that particular spot (I've seen this in linguistic
analysis software from UWO, but it requires a special card and costs a
fair bit).  Thanks for any and all illumination.
