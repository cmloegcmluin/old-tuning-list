Yes I remember Matt. You did a great job on the manual for
Music-X. I am still looking for Music-X 2, for less than
$150 which was the price at the Virgin megastore in Oxford
Street a few months ago. Iwent back with cash in November
two months after I first saw it and the shelves were empty.
Now to LucyTuning.
>A sampler can - simply sample the instrument.
That is exactly what we have been doing with arc-angel,
sampling LucyTuned guitars, and building riffs and loops.
Search on arc-angel for his site with sound etc.
It is at cityscape.co.uk, last time I looked, or4 EMail him at
arc-angel@cityscape.co.uk.
The problem comes when you try to retune the samples with
a sampler for the Ensoniq fails to give closer than one cent,
and playing against the retuned sample produces tuning errors,
unless you retune to the retuned sample, which then results
in interval errors between the retuned samples.
We have got around it as best we could with the LucyTuned
Lullabies album, yet problems remain if you try to get too
complicated with the samples using MIDI to drive them.
Have a listen on our new ShockWave site at
www.WonderlandInOrbit/projects/lullaby from Tokyo.
>partials

I stand semantic correction. I had always understood "partials"
to mean multiples of a frequency. i.e frequency multiplied by an
integer.
I have been using the term "harmonics" in the musical
(what you hear) sense rather than in the mathematical sense.
I agree, we do need some agreement on terms.
Would someone be prepared to compile a draft "Tuning 
Termanology Dictionary" which we could discuss and agree here
on-line?
My problem with the term harmonics is that I have failed to find a
better term to describe those notes that you hear as you touch
an open guitar string gently at specific "audible" points.
(Remember, my first indtrument is guitar)
So what do we call those positions, without implying that
they MUST only occur at integer frequency ratios.
I sometimes feel that the whole termanology of music,
has been "hi-jacked" by the traditional physics model.
This makes it very difficult to express otherperspectives.
