All-
	At the first two Microstocks we (the Neil 
Haverstick Trio) performed 19tet pop songs of mine, the reggae tune 
Sometimes its Right to Kill a Man and the heavy metal bluegrass Citified 
Notions. Neil, Ernie and I are currently rehearsing my other 19tet pop 
tunes for a CD, and I expect I will have at least one pop tune on the 
upcoming tuning@eartha.mills.edu compilation. I'm sure there are more 
micro-popsters out there. This stuff is just starting to find a popular 
foothold, and I wouldn't be surprised if someday soon "alternative" comes 
to imply micro.
