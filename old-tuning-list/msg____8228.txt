Oops (kind of), I was going through the digests and see that some of 
you've 
been doing similar things for a while, non ?

I use a Mac and I can't think of anything but Max that would allow 
programming this sort of thing. There is always the not so happy option
of using a regular ascii style programming language, like Java , I 
suppose ?
Has anyone here used Java to write this type of thing ? Anyone know if 
the shareware/freeware "Megalomania" can be used for this ?
