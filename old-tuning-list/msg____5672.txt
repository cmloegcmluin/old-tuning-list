Once again I correct myself: 7 is unusual in this regard because it is
smaller than 9, the smallest odd composite; actually in the example Paul
gave the chord overall was 15-limit, while each individual interval in
it was 9-limit, which shows that strictly speaking it _is_ possible for
larger primes, such 11 and 13.  However, it would not be possible to
construct a chord which included a (say) 11-limit interval, but none
higher, such that the chord overall had a higher limit.
