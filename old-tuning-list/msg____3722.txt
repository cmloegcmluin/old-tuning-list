   I absolutely agree with Paul here;  off-octaves (in 88CET at least) to my
ears really do sound like out-of-tune octaves rather than pitch relationships in
themselves.  Some have disagreed however.  

   In my 88CET demo tape I have an example of traditional harmonies as rendered
in 88CET.  The first ... six I think it was ... chords illustrate this
"wandering tonic" effect.  The progression I think was a typical I V ii V V7 I.
The trick is that the second I chord is written with the tonic in a different
octave from the first.  The effect I think is really wild and fascinating:  If
you're not paying much attention, it just sounds like a boring old chorale
fragment.  

   But if you listen more carefully (and only a little more carefully), you
notice that the tonic mysteriously migrated by about 1/41 octave.  All of our
musical experience since childhood tells us that we just went 360 degrees around
and landed where we started, but mysteriously we somehow landed somewhere else.


   Forgive me for pushing one of my proverbial hot-buttons, but some feel that
this wandering tonic effect is a problem to be dealt with, but to me it's a
really interesting, surprising, and useful musical effect.
