From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

This is a little off the beaten path, but has anyone enountered some
research about background audio frequencies and their effect on other
senses? I recently reread Lawrence Wechslers book on the artist Robert
Irwin, and mention is made of specific frequency response to the taste of
Carlsberg Elefant Bier (at one frequency it tastes best, at another it is
undrinkable); I would really like to verify the existence of the research.
Or, perhaps someone would like to duplicate it?
