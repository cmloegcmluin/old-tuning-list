   Yes, I certainly agree.  Also, the more unusual the tuning the less you can
draw from centuries of exploration in traditional tunings, and the more you have
to make up for yourself.  

   As I've opined a couple of times before, we xenharmonic composers have to be
super(wo)men.  We have to derive the equivalent of centuries of theory, and then
write music that is enjoyable even if it weren't xenharmonic.  And we often also
have to perform our own music too because nobody else can play our weird
tunings.  It's just simply a tough job, no matter how you slice it.

   But there's certainly no point in giving up, because I've found it to be a
fun and rewarding task, despite the difficulty!  And we've seen some really
exciting success stories in recent times.
