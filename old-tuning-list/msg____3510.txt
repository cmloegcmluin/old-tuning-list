   Important caveat:  That is true only with a fixed set of tones per octave.  I
Just (harhar) wanted to make sure that everybody bears that in the backs of
their minds.  

   A lot of the reason why Wendy Carlos gets impressive results with extended JI
is that she has a well-defined means of making an indefinite (not to be confused
with "infinite") number of tones per octave.  Or to put it another way, she
escapes the modal limitations Neil mentioned.
