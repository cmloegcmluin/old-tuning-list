Not really. You could conceive of a "perfectly" performed brass tone, where, 
say, the odd modes of vibration were completely absent. Then you would have 
a harmonic (a note an octave above the fundamental pitch of the instrument) 
without subharmonic content. However, there is no such thing as a 
"perfectly" performed brass tone, and this applies to winds as well. 
However, string instruments typically perform in their fundamental mode of 
vibration; did you find subharmonics in string timbres as well, after 
controlling for Nyquist effects?

In the case of brass and wind instruments, clearly the expected effect 
according to my argument is undertones, not necessarily subharmonics. These 
undertones would form an overtone series above the fundamental mode of 
vibration of the instrument, and not a subharmonic series below the note 
being played.

There is also a technique of playing brass instruments (or singing) so that 
a buzzy note results which is a subharmonic of the intended note, but is not 
an overtone of the fundamental mode of vibration. I believe Benade describes 
this phenomenon in his book on acoustics. A brass instrument with a 
fundamental frequency of 100 can produce buzzy notes at 125, 133.3, 150, 
250, 266.7, 375. But again, the final product is a harmonic series (above 
the "subharmonic"), not a subharmonic series.
