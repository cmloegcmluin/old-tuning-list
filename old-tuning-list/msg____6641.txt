What is `C'?  What is 'G'?  What is `B'?  What is the sound of
forcing a seven-sided peg into a ten-sided [for sake of argument]
hole?

When I first got into tuning, I was locked into the 7 tone diatonic
thing, too -- problem was I could never reconsile that with what
I wanted to hear.  Once I let go of my security blanket and opened
up my ears, a whole world opened up around me.

I had absolutely no trouble finding a 10 tone scale in 22 by ear,=20
with no theory at all to guide me (until after the fact, that it :).
Maybe that makes me special (of full of it), since it's more than
the magic 7, but what of it?  Lots of people listen to 12 serial
rows and to them it is comprehensible [I'm not there yet, myself].

At any rate I make music for myself, and whomever is open enough
to listen to what I might have to say.  I've no interest whatever
in forming a band to please the masses [and I'm not that good=20
yet, anyhow ;-)].

I found this yesterday, while noodling around on my worthless^H^H^H^H
22TET guitar:

To make sense of it, you should read Pauls paper on 22.  I will say
now that I found this aurally, and I have yet to sit down and grind
the numbers out.  Frankly, numbers don't mean squat if it sounds
good, IMHO as a musician.

I've been working with Pauls Decatonic Minor modes, notably the=20
Standard Pentachordal form.  [I haven't seen the edition of the
paper with the graphics, so I'll use the following notation:
=09
=09I(10) - Maj decatonic tetrad
=09i(10) - min     "       "
=09I-(10) - Maj-Min tetrad
=09i+(10) - min-Maj tetrad
=09I*(10) - Augmented tetrad.
]

What I've found is that the three _consonant_ chords that completly
define the mode as suggested by Paul are i, II- and III. =20

I was playing with various patterns of chords like this:

    i(10) -> v(10) -> i(10) -> IV(10) -> III(10) -> II-(10) -> i

when I came up with the following modulation to the subdominant (v):
[assume the `(10)' subscript here]:

  First, firmly establish the sense of tonality:

    i -> v -> i -> IV -> III -> II- -> i

  Then, go to the subdom:

   i -> v -> i -> IV -> III+ -> IV+ -> v   (of i)

                        [IX+] -> [X+] -> i  (of v)

This was every bit as powerful, if not more so, to my ears, as the
usual diatonic modulation to the dominant. =20

Now, as soon as I can find an equally cool way to get back again,
I'm going to plop a reel on the 8 track and start working on a=20
bass line. ;-)
