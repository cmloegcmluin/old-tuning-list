   Does that mean that you'd like to change the name of a scale that's
existed for several hundred years to quarter-ptolemaic-just-syntonic-comma
meantone?

   A P5 is a basic chord and scale constructor, whereas a syntonic comma is
a measured result of a specific experiment, which has subsequently been
used as a semigeneric unit of pitch difference for specifying the sizes of
meantone fifths.

   I'm not in favor of changing the size of the centimeter, thank you.

   The syntonic comma is interesting, historically speaking, for two
attributes:  First is how it comes about (the pitch difference between
large and small Ptolemaic whole-steps).  The second is that it is probably
the most basic of a handful of justifications (all puns intended) for an
OPEN system of tuning - one with an indefinite number of tones per octave's
span.

   The task of either accepting precise renderings of just ratios,
including the comma discrepancies it generates, or of tempering in terms of
that comma, is almost certainly the single-longest running thread in the
history of tuning.

   Now, we have a new concept that shows only one of those two vital
attributes - the difference between large and small whole tones, but
explicitly precludes an open system of tuning.  We are faced with a choice:
Do we generalize an existing term to where one of its two most important
attributes is rendered irrelevant, or at least secondary?  Or, do we derive
from the first term, a new term for the new concept?

   I think that Ivor Darreg's choice of "pseudo<X>" is at least a pretty
good term for something that has some, but not all, of the qualities of an
"<X>".  Perhaps a "quasi<X>" would be better?

   If you two really think that it's better to reuse an existing term ...
Well...  OK...  "Syntonic comma" certainly wouldn't be the first such term.
