Barbershop singers must then be superhuman, as most can and do sing way way
way more accurately than this.

This is all Greek to me.  All of the septimal intervals are used in
Barbershop singing, and I've got some Barbershop that sounds like glass.
Exposure to it has been known to cause paradigm shifts.

This third is only 1 cent off the 9/7, which is only dissonant if you use it
like, or expect to hear a 5/4.  Speaking of which, the 7th 22TET degree
offers a 5/4 far better than 12 or 19 tone.  Only 4 cents off.

>minor thirds (273 cents)

The 7/6 is the 7th superparticular, one of the most consonant intervals
known to man.  The 22TET, 6 cent deviation is very significant, however.

>major sixths (927 cents) and minor sixths (764 cents)

Inversions of the above.=20

We're talking about equal temperament?

The gods aren't cool enough to have invented dissonance

But the other isn't melodically usable?

I don't understand.

Narower from what?
