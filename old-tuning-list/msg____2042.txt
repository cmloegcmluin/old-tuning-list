If you read the above again carefully, I never said that Kirnberger quoted
any statements by Bach.

Yes and no: Although Circular Temperaments fit the above criteria, all
Multi-linears and most Linears, by their very nature, don't.  (e.g., mean
tone limits modulation to keys utilizing no more than three sharps or two
flats...free modulation [through the the peripheral keys] doesn't exist in
mean tone.)

[quote by Mr. Hahn]
:Several times Kirnberger himself told me and others how the famous J.S.
:Bach (during the time of the former's musical instruction under the
:latter) made over to him the tuning of his keyboard, and how that master
:expressly desired him to make all major thirds sharp.  In a tuning with
:all major thirds sharp, no pure major third can occur, but as soon as no
:pure major thirds are found, so too no major third can be found [which
:is] a comma (81/80) sharp.  J.S. Bach, whose hearing was not impaired by
:bad arithmetic, must have heard that a major third a comma sharp is a
:disgusting interval.  Why else did he entitle his collection of preludes
:and fugues in all twenty-four keys the Art of Temperament?

Flat fifths were never mentioned in Rasch's quote.  But you are correct in
stating that Marpurg is wrong; What Marpurg probably meant to say was
that if all the major thids where to be made wide, a major third, wide by a
syntonic comma, was not possible.  I suspect that Marpurg wrote the
above just to perturb Kirnberger.  (The whole quote refers to Marpurg's
ridicule of Kirnberger II and Kirnberger's temperament theory in general.)

Kinberger himself, for all the polemics with Marpurg, remains silent on the
disposition of J.S. Bach's temperament.  However, knowing Kirnberger, he
would have LEPT at the chance to publically humiliate Marpurg, were
Marpurg's original statement about J.S. Bach's temperament false (this
would follow the pattern of their famous vituperations).  He didn't.  It is
inconceivable that Kirnberger was unaware of the passage in question.
That is why we can probably trust that the quote represents correct
information.  This is also the reason that you should not dismiss evidence
in Marpurg so quickly...
