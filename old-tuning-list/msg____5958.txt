Subject: Re: World Harmony Project Tuning Digest 1150

From: "Andrew L. Kaye" <androsky@multicomnet.com.br>

I appreciate Denny Genovese's response to my query: "So, thanks to your
interest we are (at least for now) abandoning the assertion that '[Just
intonation] is therefore the starting place from which all indigenous
musical traditions began' and will modify our web page accordingly."   I
especially like the parenthetical "at least for now," because my point
was not to criticize the assertion, but to encourage our tuning experts
to undertake the research that would prove or disprove it.  We badly
need a "World Harmony Project": if we actually measured and classified
world harmonic practice (i.e. intervallic usage whether played
simultaneously in chords or in recursive melodic patterns) we would
probably have many of the answers participants in the tuning list are
looking for.
