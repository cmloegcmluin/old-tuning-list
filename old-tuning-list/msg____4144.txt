Well, one possible strategy for making sure that your friendly neighborhood
academic will have *no* reason for exploring said nontraditional tuning spaces
would be to adopt the rhetorical strategy recently widely visible in the past
Presidential contest, in which the estimable Mr. Dole railed at some length
about where the "outrage" was in such a way as to suggest that his audience was
either ignorant or complicit. It strikes me that Brian's ah...interpretation of
academic life has much to disrecommend it in that regard. I'm going the stealth
route myself - sneaking in the microtonal work now and then, and raising up an
interactive radio audience of folks who call me with questions which I can then
transform into the beginnings of a discussion on using something other than
equal temperament. It works for me, anyway. Of course, I suppose that 5 hours
of LaMonte Young doesn't exactly qualify as a "sneak...." :-)

with regards,
Gregory

paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
