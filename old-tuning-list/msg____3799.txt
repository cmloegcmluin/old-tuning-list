Subject: The pleasures of listener-sponsored radio

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

I think it's actually going to happen: On November 10th, the two gentlemen
who come after me in the Sunday evening radio landscape and I are creating a
long meta-program which will air all of LaMonte Young's "The Well Tuned
Piano" in its entirety, from 9:00 PM - ~1:40 AM or so. As it currently
stands, we still need to drop in the regulation FCC station IDs, which we'll
do in between the CDs which comprise the original Gramavision CD release.

It ought to be fun. With that broadcast as an opener, the follow-on program
of other music outside of 12TET will happen a couple of weeks later. Onward.

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
Powers, "Galatea 2.2"] Gregory Taylor/Heurikon Corporation/Madison, WI
