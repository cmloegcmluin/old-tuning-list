You are correct here.  Two booboos in one:  a Bb -31 is the correct notation.

This is what I mean by "rote."  You learned in advance of applying your 
ear.  If you had not, you would join the human race in being unable to 
split the unfamiliar 7/4 in half.

Actually, I am fluid in playing and singing both 7ET and 5ET, but I 
learned them.  One could not simply initiate these scales on the spot.  
One can "learn" the placements of anything (12ET proves that).  One 
cannot do so unaided by previous preparation.

Please don't misunderstand me.  I only want to underscore that AFMM 
musicians may be more devoted and more virtuosic than some, but they 
merely paid their dues, learning one tuning after another.  They are 
drawn from the pool of all trained conservatory players.  There is less 
of a difference in skill than in attitude, based upon my experiences.
