From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Bria McLaren's colorful language always entertains, and it is quite 
informative.  Much as I wish it wasn't true, his thesis regarding Lincoln 
Center is essentially accurate.

Having performed at Alice Tully Hall I can state for the record that they 
are just now learning to take microtonal music seriously.  To their 
credit, many of the upper administration attended the Ives Universe 
premiere and responded positively, to their own surprise.

Unfortunately, it is still true that their is real prejudice against 
things microtonal.  On the other hand, as Bernard Holland says in todays 
New York Times in _The Decline and Fall of the Classical Empire?_

"The demise I see coming is neither good nor evil.  Having outlived its 
time, the system is dying of old age; its various conflicts are like 
geriatric diseases.  I am alarmed for the future of music.  The music 
business I shall not miss at all."

I would add that as we pay our way and bring greater numbers to our 
music, we shall be most hearily embraced by the powers that be (or been).
Seen in light of a big picture of change in the music industry, 
microtonal music appears strong.
