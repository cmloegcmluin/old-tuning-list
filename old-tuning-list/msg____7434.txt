   Ah, good of you to mention that one.

   I personally am aware of the book, and have not read it.  I get the
impression however that it's mostly about 12-toned well temperaments.  That
as opposed to talking about the earlier (e.g., JI) tunings, or the more
recent unusual tunings, like 31TET or quartertones.

   Is that true?
