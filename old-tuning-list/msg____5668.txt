Rudolf Kolisch always made a point of tuning all four violin strings to the
piano when playing accompanied. His recording of the Schumann _Phantasie_is probably as close as one can come to 12tet violin playing. His influence
through his teaching in America and in Europe - especiallly at the
Darmstädter Ferienkursen - is not to be underestimated; his writings onperformance practice, particular tempi of works in the Viennese traditioncontinue to be influential.
