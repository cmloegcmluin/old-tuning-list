  There's a lot of out-of-tune pianos out there, but as long as the keys
  have drifted equally (usually in the "flat" direction), it doesn't seem
  to affect the emotion of the piece.  (Of course if the keys have drifted
  unequally, it's time to get the piano tuned, or to throw it off the roof
  of Baker House, in Cambridge, Mass., USA.)

  My own pet theory is that as you listen to music, your ears accept the
  imperfections in tuning that are presented to them, and knows what was
  "meant".  So the same idea/emotion/whatever comes across, whether you're
  using equal temperament/meantone temperament/just intonation/whatever.

  Although I claim to have perfect pitch, the piano I grew up with was
  about a half-step flat, which permanently messed with my accuracy.  So I
  too sometimes lean on the crutch of the hums of electrical devices.

  Most devices emit a "60 cycle" hum (at least that's what it is in the USA
  - some other countries use stuff like 50 cycles).  That'll give you a
  note somewhere between B natural and B flat, presuming A natural is 440
  cycles per second (which, again, may not be true in other countries, nor
  for other centuries for that matter).  So you can usually use that as a
  reference tone.

  WARNING!!!:  You may get a note different than "B half flat" from devices
  with rotating parts, such as fans and other motors, since gears and
  variable-speed controls can alter the frequency.  Things like light bulbs
  are more reliable, but you gotta find a loud one, like a flourescent
  bulb.

  Great thread!

  century).
