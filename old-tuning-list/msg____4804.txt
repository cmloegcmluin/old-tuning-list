Subject: can anyone explain these "ghosttones"?

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

I posted the following in alt.sci.physics.acoustics a few days ago
and got the following reply.
Can any of our maths people give me more pointers please?
Does this give anyone new ideas of how to explain the "ghosttones"?

  No, harmonics from physical sources such as flutes and oboes and
bells are not integrally separated.  Generally one solves families
of solutions to Bessel or Legendre type equations, and these are not
simple integer multiples.
