      I have read that the potassium (or magnesium or something like them),
uptake requirements for a nerve cell to "reload" and fire again requires
enough time so that a single cell can only trigger 600  times a second.  This
has repercussions when you are trying to transmit a 4,000 Hz signal over the
the ol' brain.  I believe that the "volley theory" attempts to explain the
process by which multiple hairs share the task of transmitting an appropriate
signal.

     The harmonics would be registered in a different location along the Organ
of Corti, would they not?    I mean, your ear doesn't necessarily know that
they are harmonics, does it?  It is just a set of frequencies that are being
received.

   I have been reading of the Mandelbrot sets for a long time, but there is no
one around to actually discuss this with,  so I have a question: How do you
pronounce this name?  is is Mandel Brot as in "rot" or Brot with a long "o"?
( excuse the small pocket of ignorance here, but I gotta know. )
