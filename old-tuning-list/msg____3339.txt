To which might be added that Sauveur's table of 1711 consists of
divisions which have the chromatic 12-tone scale embedded in them and
hence the diatonic scale too. The connection between Sauveur's and
Blackwood's relation is rather simple. The comma plus the chromatic
semitone is the diatonic semitone and the chromatic semitone plus the
diatonic semitone is the whole tone. 
So for instance if the ratio comma:chromatic semitone is 2:3 
(for 50-tET), then the next is 3:5 and thus D:T is 5:8.

With American coffee, that means lots of drinking :-)
