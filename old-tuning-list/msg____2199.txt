Subject: trivial errata in the series of psychoacoustics posts
---
As some of you might have guessed, my series of 25 psychoacoustics
posts constitute a distilled and simplified early version of a significantly
longer and more detailed  monograph on tuning and psychoacoustics.
This paper should appear in Xenharmonikon 18, perhaps in 1997. Until
then, it behooves me to point out that some errors crept into
the posts--some apparently due to end-of-line word deletions during
uploads, etc.
Other errors are entirely my own fault.
In Topic 8 of Digest 508 a dropped word at the end of a line 
produced a significant distortion of the intended meaning.  
The full and accurate text is:
---
It is well known that the description of the ear to which Doty,
Worrall and Alves (known as the place theory of hearing) refer is
incomplete and conflicts with much of the psychoacoustic
evidence.  "A second difficulty with the place theory lies in 
the fact that, in complex sounds, components are often heard
that are NOT present in the Fourier analysis.  Or loudness 
judgments of components may be made which do not agree 
with the amplitudes obtained for Fourier components.  It is 
certainly true that there are phenomena which cannot at the 
present time be explained by the plaheory of hearing." 
[von Bekesy, Georg, "Hearing Theories and Complex Sounds," 
Journ. of the Acoust. Soc. Am, 35(4), April
1963, pg. 589]  Be it noted that von Bekesy is the researcher 
most responsible for compiling experimental evidence for 
the place theory. (In fact he won the Nobel prize for it.)
---
Leaving out the italicized word "NOT" from the posted text
produces a distinctly false impression.  Mea culpa.
---
Several other  errata appeared in Digest 511, topic 6:
The title of the reference listed as [5] should be "The Physics
and Psychophysics of Music" by Juan Roederer, 2nd ed., 1973.
(There is now a third edition, 1995, same author, same title.)
My post incorrectly listed the title as "Introduction to the
Physics and Psychophysics of Music," etc.  Important if you
try to look up the book in a computerized library system!
Under the reference listed as [6]  the sentence should read
"...more detailed than any text but Pierce (1992)."  This is my
flub.  Because John R. Pierce's "The Science of Musical Sound"
from 1992 has a virtually *identical* title to Johan Sundberg's
"The Science of Musical SoundS" (S on the end) *ALSO* 
published in 1992, I confuted them here.  The sense of the
paragraph is that Sundberg's 1992 book offers more complete
references and a wider consideration of psychoacoustic ear/brain
models than any general-reading text other than Pierce's book 
(also from 1992).
