Subject: where do the 5ths go?

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

The answer to Neal's question might depend on your view of the fundamentals
of mathematics. A strict finitist might very well not accept arbitrary
transposition downward, while most will be satisfied that transposing thefundmental downward until octave multiples of all the desired tones fall
within a given range is unobjectionable, even if the fundmental becomes so
low as to be a completely theoretical entity.

It is interesting to look at examples of systems where the octave is not
the basic building block but rather the fifth or another interval.
Classical harmonics used conjunct tetrachords and pentachords as well as
the octave-filling disjunct tetrachords. Xenakis suggested reviving this
technique. One way of hearing the three javanese slendro pathet is as
conjunct pentatonic tetrachords (each with four tones encompassing an
approximate acoustical fifth). A lot of melodies from very different
repertoires might be usefully analysed in these terms, where formal unitsare defined by the range of a fifth. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
