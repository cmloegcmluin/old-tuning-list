I suggest considering the unique Waldorf WAVE and MicroWave synthesizers
also. These fantastic devices allow very expressive and subtle sound
programming (Wavetable synthesis, like the legendary PPG in the 80s). And
they are great for microtuning. While the WAVE is a luxury device (>
$8500), the MicroWave is affordable (about $2100) and sounds nearly the
same (but is a rack mounting device instead of a fully equiped instrument).

I use a MicroWave with the SoundDiver (Emagic) editing software and create
microtuning tables with my own composing system "Leviathan" written in
Objectworks\Smalltalk (similar to Symbolic Composer).

I really *love* the clear and distinct, crisp sound of the Waldorf synth.
