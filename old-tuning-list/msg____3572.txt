Subject: BBshop 4tet & 7ths

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Yes, without a doubt I don't know much about barbershop quartets, although I
enjoy it.  My apparently false impression that most of the chords are dominant
sevenths is based upon a radio interview I heard several years ago with the head
of a barbershop quartet.  He described one part as always singing the seventh in
a chord.  I presumably misheard him, or misunderstood him.  Whatever...

   But anyway, my main point, that whether 4:5:6:7 is consonant or dissonant
depends on context, I think is valid.  

   I suppose that that also partly depends on whether one uses the textbook
definition of dissonance (a chord demands a certain resolution), or the more
common but technically incorrect meaning, that being as a substitute for
"discord".  But perhaps that's mostly just a bunch of silly nitpicking.
