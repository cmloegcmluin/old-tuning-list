   I presume that this is your piano frame and sound board played kinda
like a psaltry?

Or hammerdulcimer if you will.

Paul Rapoport Said:

"I'd also prefer a week of 6 days and months of 5 such weeks, but don't get
me started...the clock I have running in my office is a digital dozenally
metric one, with the day divided into nested 12s. Hope that doesn't get me
thrown off the tuning list. But 12 is a lot better for counting time than
the mishmash we have of 10, 2, 5, 12, and 60. (Don't worry, there are only
three of these clocks in existence.) "

I'd love to get you started. I did an independant study project on the
natural basis for time keeping while at New College. One product of that
study was a Harmonic Clock. It divides the solar day into al the harmonics
through 48. Unbuilt is a design for a calandar/clock that keeps track of the
Sun, Moon and all the planets in their relative positions (must be placed on
a South Wall for accuracy) to the part of the Earth on which I sit, with a
revolving star map as a background to keep track of siderial time. around
the edge are various scales to keep track of various things including the
gregorian calandar.
