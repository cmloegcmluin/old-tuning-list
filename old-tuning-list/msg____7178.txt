Subject: Re: Fretless versus Fretted

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

An interesting cultural similarity is the 'oud in the Middle East.

Meaning "wood" in Arabic, and the impetus for the "lute" in Europe, the
'oud alternates between fretted and unfretted ever 200 years or so.
Apparently, this is to change its tone, not its tuning.  Presently, the
'oud is fretted.
