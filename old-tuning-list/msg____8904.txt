Paul Erlich graced us with:

>Yes, and luckily they are ascii!

..and just when I was wondering why this is the first time in months that
two digests arrived in one day! Might I suggest, in the interests of
conserving bandwidth, that someone chip in and buy Paul some space on a
server somewhere so he can post this to the "Paul Erlich Memorial ASCII
Diagram Home Page"? Hmmmmm? I mean, we only recently fixed the emailer he
was using that was spewing out the HTML code every posting!!  :)

[The previous was posted in a humorous and non-rankerous mode; nonetheless,
the basic premise stands.]

Oh, yeah, my dear Dan Wolf: I know, I *just know*, that with all your
intellectual prowess (witness your boundless knowledge of tuning, music and
cultures) -- can you get you email configured so the lines don't break and
the odd bits of ASCII thrown in? Your words are too good to make my brain
hurt that way... (it's almost as if your msgs were becoming "basic
mutilations" [intoned in an old, world-weary voice]).

[Again, my old correspondent Dan will take this in the good cheer it is
sent in...]

And to all others, healthy tuning to you. Do people really want to hear
opinions on the forum CD? Honest ones, with no-holds barred? I've been
having fun with it, but I like to my opinions to myself. Radical honesty
puts people off.......

Cheers,
Jon

P.S. My spell checker doesn't like "non-rankerous" and suggests
"non-cancerous"
