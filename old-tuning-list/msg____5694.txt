One thing you don't hear in performance (good ones, at least!) is   
musicians wandering around frequency space searching for the right   
intervals.  That's because a significant fraction of practice and   
rehearsal time is spent on intonation.  Musicians learn what it *feels*   
like to produce a certain note so they can do so in performance, coming   
in on the right pitch.  In the practice room, the pitch standard is an   
electronic tuner or a piano.  In rehearsal, the standard is each other.   
 A choir that rehearses with, say, an organ will adjust its intonation to   
whatever is the temperament of the organ.  You may not want to say that   
the choir members are deliberately choosing a temperament, but they   
definitely are adjusting the set of pitches they produce to match a   
predefined set.

I don't see how choir members can listen for beats at all, unless they   
are all singing long notes with absolutely no vibrato.  Whether or not   
the ear hears the top or bottom or something else as "the" pitch, vibrato   
prevents beats from forming by continuously varying the pitch and/or   
amplitude.  If any could form, the vibrato would drown them out with its   
own beats.  Most of the time, the notes go by too fast to listen for   
beats anyway.  The only way to judge intervals under those conditions is   
by the absolute pitch difference, which is, I believe, how singers really   
sing.

.. which doesn't seem to make all that much difference, as they then   
proceed to avoid open strings because a) the tone quality is considered   
to be less desirable and b) they can't use vibrato on them.  The actual   
intonation is determined by finger placement.  Changing the pitch of a   
whole string reduces the amount of adjustment a cellist must make in hand   
and finger position, but the end result for all the strings players in   
the ensemble is the same: adjusting the set of pitches they produce to   
match a predefined set.

Singers and instrumentalists adjust their intonation in rehearsal, and   
(attempt to!) reproduce it in performance.  For those performing with a   
tempered keyboard instrument, the result will be a performance in that   
temperament.
