All-
	I'm finally back on line after a two week hiatus. A hacker broke 
into the math departments main server "math" and wreaked some havoc. Our 
systems administrator has her back up, for good I hope. 
	For those dissatisfid with the forum CD cover, there are several CD art 
programs for making color inserts on your home computer. For those occasions 
when you must have color on your CDs, it costs just pennies per copy, plus, 
you can plug yourself! How about "The Microtonal Masterpieces of John 
Starrett, plus samplings of several other artists";-)
	I recall some mention of my "no 12th root of 2" logo. I forgot 
the context, but if anyone wants to use it it's fine with me.
