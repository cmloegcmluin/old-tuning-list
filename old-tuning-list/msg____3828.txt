Subject: Re: notation

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Before meaningfully playing a microtonal piece of music, pitch 
discrimination must be heard in the mind's ear of the player; and at the 
same time be written clearly regarding ideal theoretical pitch placement.

Interval relationship sensibilities are learned independently from exact 
points of pitch, however.  

The sense and the logic of the relationships of tones is apart from 
their symbology.  Using the method of notation I described is the most
accurate and straight forward approach I've yet discovered.
