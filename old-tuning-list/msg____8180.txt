>Double Equal Temperament, or 144-tET, does not provide for anything
resembling traditional "mean temperament" (presumably meaning meantone
temperament). The fifths of meantone temperament are typically around
696-698 cents, while 144-tET contains no intervals between 692 and 700
cents. 288-tET would be required to unify meantone with these other
systems of tuning.

The tuning scale steps in Double Equal Temperament available for around the 5th
are:

Name  Ratio       Cents
G-    2^(83/144)  691.667
G     2^(7/12)    700
G+    2^(85/144)  708.333

In "On the Sensations of Tone" by Helmholtz, page 484, meantone temperament
"specimens of tuning" ranges for G are 697-733 cents. Likewise for Just
Intonation, on page 486, G is usually tuned to 702 cents (a ratio of 3/2). In
either case, Schillinger only claims that "the micro-units are the best
averages for
all differences between units of the 12th root of 2 and just intonation
(natural scale)". There are further comments in "Tuning" by Owen Jorgensen
concerning the tuners used by Alexander Ellis (the editor of Helmhotz' work)
which indicate their minor innacuracies but they are still within the above
cents constraints of "best averages".
