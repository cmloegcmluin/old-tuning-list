I'll start culling through my files to find the messages that are worth
reposting.

I don't think so . . .

Look at these URLs:

http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist.txt
http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist2.txt
http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist3.txt

The first shows what Paul E. and I were calling "consistency level" for
all ETs up to 1200TET.  A tuning is level N consistent at a certain
harmonic limit M if not only all the M-limit intervals are consistently
represented, but also up to N combinations of them.  Example: because
12TET is level 3 consistent at the 5-limit, we know that three 6/5s (3
steps), or 216/125, will be most closely approximated by 9 steps.

The second shows the same information as the first, but only displays an
ET if there is some limit at which it has a higher level of consistency
than all lower-numbered ETs, going up to 10000.

The third shows the greatest error in cents for each harmonic limit an
ET is consistent within, up to 99TET.
