I use Wavmaker and find that it meets my requirements.  My African musician
friends compose using general midi instruments. During the render to wav process
the tuning is modified using a tabled based on their native scale which uses haf
tones.

If they want to play their native instruments with GM instruments during the
recording process, I use another of Polyhedric's products called Mellosoftron, a
software synthesizer which enables one to developed their own instruments. So
during the recording process everything is in tune.
