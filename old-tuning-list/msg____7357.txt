Subject: Re:  Subject: microtonality in popular music

From: "Ed & Alita Morrison" <essaim@texas.net>

John Loffink and others who know about samples of microtonal music in
movies have talked about the subject frequently in the Tuning Digests.  I
have interest in "2001" and "Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan" - soundtrack.
 Can someone tell me how to find the exact spots where the microtonal music
is located.  Perhaps you could describe the scenes so that I could see the
scenes and hear the music with it?  I would think that others reading these
Tuning Digests would be interested also.    ALITA MORRISON
