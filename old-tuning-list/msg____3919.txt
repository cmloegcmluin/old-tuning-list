Bringing up the tempo of a piece is actually a good point. I have claimed 
that just intervals can be tuned with greater precision, by ear, than 
intervals that are based on logarithmic (equal cents) constructions, only if 
simultaneities (and the resulting beats) are examined. Another caveat is 
that the simulataneities must be listened to for long periods of time, while 
in melodies, equal vs. unequal intervals can be heard even at fast tempi.

Tuning two guitar strings a quartertone apart does not require tuning to the 
11:8. As long as the beat rate of one quartertone is between those of the 
two adjacent quartertones, the result will not be more than 0.7 cents off. 
This is better than the 1.3 cent error from using 11:8, and usually better 
than the 0.6 cent error from using 11:6. Needless to say, all of these 
methods are better than just trying to divide the semitone into two 
melodically (=logarithmically) equal parts, but only if one can listen to 
the intervals for longer than a fraction of a second at a time.
