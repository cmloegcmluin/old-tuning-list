Subject: eMUSIC CD's

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

I just received an email flyer from eMUSIC with a selection of
recordings of John Cage's works. Their other offerings sound as if
they would be of interest to members of the TUNING List so I have
appended a drastically shortened and edited notice below. Email
eMUSIC for prices and more information.
 
<The Cage discography is the first of our subject catalogs.  In the next few
<months, you can expect to see catalogs on microtonal music, pioneers of
<electronic music, words and music, transformed sounds, improvisation, and
<more.
 
<You'll also see a variety of special catalogs from time to time.  Coming
<soon: a Larry Austin birthday tribute, with the entire CDCM catalog at sale
<prices; a group of special publisher offers; and "Discs Warren Burt has Known
<and Loved."
 
 For information on how to order CDs, Email to:  eMusc@aol.com
Fax to:  (518) 434-0308, Telephone to:  (518) 434-4110
Hard mail and carrier pigeon to:  eMUSIC, 116 North Lake Avenue, Albany NY
