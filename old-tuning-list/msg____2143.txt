Subject: Re: Computing Nth Roots

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

As John (C) briefly aluded here, graphical methods can place frets,
toneholes, lengths of bars, or most any other physical dimension to pretty
decent precision.  

   In the case of 12TET, once you precisely calculate whatever dimensions you're
interested in for the square root (tritone), the square root of that (minor
third), and the product of the two (minor sixth), you've got a 4TET scale.  You
can graph those points and "french curve" in the rest of the notes' dimensions
to pretty decent accuracy.  Certainly far greater accuracy than the "lipping"
range of a wind instrument.  

   Fixed pitch instruments like the bells mentioned here would have a little
error here and there, but not a whole lot more than you get from typical
well-temperament schemes.  (Now of course the "error" from ET in well
temperament schemes are intentional and desirable, but I'm sure you get my
point.)
