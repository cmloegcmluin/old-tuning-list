Subject: New Xenharmoniker

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I received a letter from a fellow in India named Joel Rodrigues.  (By the
way, he's from Goa, which is a former Portugese colony in India, wherein most
everybody speaks a somewhat earlier form of Portugese than that spoken in
Portugal.  That presumably also explains why his name ends in "s" rather than
the Spanish spelling with "z".)

   Anyway, he's new to xenharmonics, and is interested in thoughts on
synthesizers and PC software for xenharmonic work.  He's currently thinking
about an Ensoniq TS-12 with Finale.  

   He's making a move soon, so if you folks have any insights or advice you'd
like to give him, drop him a letter (he doesn't have E-mail yet).  For example,
I'll warn him away from Finale.

   His address is:      Joel Rodrigues
