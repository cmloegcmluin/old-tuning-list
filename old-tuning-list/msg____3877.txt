Beating is dependent upon frequency as well as interval size, so you'll 
have to set this according to your own purposes. The formula will vary 
according to the just (beatless) interval which a tempered interval most 
nearly approximates. Let's represent the just interval as "x/y", and 
indicate the size of the tempered interval close to this as "t"; the 
frequency of the lower pitch in  the interval t we shall call "f". In 
this case the upper pitch of t will be ft. Take harmonic number y of the 
upper pitch, which will have the frequency fty, and subtract from this 
the harmonic number x of the lower pitch, which will have the frequency 
fx, i.e. f(ty - x). A positive result means that the tempered interval 
is sharper than the neighbouring just interval, and a negative result 
will signify flatness.

To give an example: say you wish to find the rate at which the 12-TET 
fifth above A = 220Hz beats. In this case x = 3, y = 2, t = 2^(7/12) and 
f = 220. You will then have to calculate 220(2[2^(7/12)] - 3). The 
result is  nearly -0.75, so you should listen for 3 beats every 4 
seconds.

I hope this enables you to complete your task, Lorenzo. Ciao!
