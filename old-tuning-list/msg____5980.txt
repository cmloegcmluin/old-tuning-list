Subject: Jacques DUDON

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

I come back from a workshop organized by Jacques DUDON on construction of a
monochord. As he lives very near the Abbaye du Thoronet we also went there
to sing: It was an unforgetable experience! (It is considered as one of the
best acoustic in the world for overtones).

I stayed few days after the workshop to work with Jacques and had the
pleasure to play some of his marvelous instruments:
The Photo-Sonic Disks, of course, but also the Chandravina, a very long
monochord played with a bootleneck where both parts of the strings are
amplified, the Aquavina, a dulcimer-like with aquatic resonator fretted in
Arabic and Persian just scales. A whole set of "baton-bouteille" (wood stick
with bootle resonator) tuned in Slendro and many others.

We planed to make a Just Intonation Band for concerts next spring. He
already made some Disks (photo-sonic) related to my copy of H.Partch's
Adapted guitar, and I'll order a new fingerboard (on my interchangeable
fingerboard classical guitar) in a just Heptatonic scale called by Jacques
"Mohajira" and I found a process to make interchangeable frets on my
electric fretless which will be tuned to a Slendro.

We expect to have a keyboard player (micro-tuning), one or two string
players (including me) and some percussion players. Everyone living in
France or near interested is welcome!

P.S: I am working on a new issue (#3) of microMegas in which there will be a
special "dossier" on Micro-Minimalists Arnold Dreyblatt, Rhys Chatam and
Glenn Branca.
