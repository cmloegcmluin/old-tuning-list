Subject: Re: TUNING Resolution

From: Ascend11 <Ascend11@aol.com>

=09I recently joined the tuning forum and have followed the recent discus=
sion=0Aabout tuning resolution with interest.  I have worked fairly exten=
sively with=0AFourier additive analysis and pitch extraction algorithms (=
which I received=0Afrom the University of Illinois=92 CERL music lab and =
further developed), and=0Ahave analyzed a number of digitally recorded vo=
ice and acoustic instrument=0Asounds (16 bit signed integer samples at a =
40 KHz sampling rate).  In this=0Awork I was impressed by the closeness o=
f the frequencies of the partials of=0Amany, but not all instrument sound=
s to being exact integer multiples of the=0Abasis frequency as determined=
 by pitch extraction (as a frequency vs time=0Atrajectory which I usually=
 computed at points roughly a millisecond apart over=0Athe course of the =
sound).  Frequently the deviations of time averaged partial=0Afrequencies=
 from n times the time averaged basis frequencies (n an integer)=0Awere l=
ess than one cent.

=09Here are some results which I obtained:  For three recorded soprano no=
tes of=0Aroughly one second duration with vowel sounds =93ah=94 and =93ee=
=94 at e4 and f4, I=0Aaveraged the =93global=94 frequency of the sound ov=
er the main portion of the note=0A(appreciable sound volume) and then ave=
raged the frequencies of the first 20=0Apartials over this same portion o=
f the note.  For three notes, the average=0Aabsolute values for the devia=
tions of the average partial frequencies from n=0Atimes the average =93gl=
obal=94 frequency were: 0.44, 1.04, and 0.48 cents.  For=0Athree recorded=
 baritone =93ah=94 sounds at a2, g3, and c4, having durations of=0Aroughl=
y 2 seconds, these deviations in cents (average for first 20 partials)=0A=
were 0.57, 0.55, and 0.41.  For a trombone f3 sound, the average absolute=
=0Avalue of the deviation of a partial=92s average frequency from n times=
 the=0Asound=92s global frequency was .48 cents (first 20 partials).

=09The averages of the instantaneous deviations of the frequencies of par=
tials=0Afrom n times the global frequency over a set of time points space=
d a=0Amillisecond apart over the duration of the sounds appeared to be co=
nsiderably=0Agreater than this.

=09In the case of a flute d4 note a little under a second in duration, th=
e=0Adeviations in the average partial frequencies from n times the global=
=0Afrequency of the sound amounted to 4.55 cents, roughly ten times great=
er than=0Athese deviations were for the sung notes and the trombone note.

=09I analyzed a piano a2 sound of roughly 2 seconds=92 duration and here =
will give=0Athe cent deviations of the average partial frequencies from n=
 times the=0Aaverage global frequency over the early portion of the sound=
 just after the=0Apeak of the attack for the first 20 partials:  Partial =
1: -11.4 cents; par. 2:=0A-6.7 cents; par. 3: -7.3; par. 4: -6.7; par. 5:=
 -6.5; par. 6: -5.8; par. 7:=0A-4.8; par. 8: -3.5; par. 9: -1.1; par. 10:=
 +1.0; par. 11: +5.1; par. 12: +5.0;=0Apar. 13: +7.9; par. 14: 10.4; par.=
 15: +8.9; par. 16: +16.9; par. 17: +20.1;=0Apar. 18: +23.0; par. 19: +24=
6; par. 20: +29.1.  The results for a c4 piano=0Anote I analyzed were si=
milar but not identical to those for the a2.

=09I've gone into some specific detail as I believe this is necessary in =
order=0Ato give a meaningful picture of the results of this work.

=09I have the impression that seemingly small shifts in the frequencies o=
f=0Amusical sounds can have surprisingly large effects on the cumulative=
=0Aimpression which the music creates.
