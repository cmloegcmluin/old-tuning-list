Subject: Accessibility of Partch

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Right now, I am busy analysing some music of Harry Partch, and I'm sure 
that I am not the first among us to be daunted by the two greatest 
obstacles in such a study.  It is well discussed that his tablature 
notation makes reading a score tedious, but it is not so well discussed 
that the scores themselves are relatively hard to get.

I am told that the stop and go process of home-style transcriptions of 
Partch's music into Ben Johnston's notation has amassed to encompass 
almost the entire repertoire, but the contributors to this project are 
scattered and not coordinated.

If you have transcribed or arranged any of Partch's music for his own 
instruments or others, I would appreciate 
your help by letting me know which pieces you have done, how it is 
notated, and for which instruments it is (if not for the originals).  I 
can then compile and distribute a list, which will simply allow people to 
contact others as potential sources for copies.
