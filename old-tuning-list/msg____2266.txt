Not quite.  A transcendental number is one that is not
algebraic.  That is, it is not a solution of a polynomial
equation with rational coefficients.  The smallest non-trivial
set closed under a `finite number of arithmetic operations (add,
subtract, multiply, divide)' is the rational numbers.  While
the square root of 12, for example, whose `decimals go on forever
without repeating in *any* pattern', is not rational.  Neither
is it transcendental, being a root of the equation x^12=2.

A remarkable fact about transcendental numbers is that, despite
their name, they are as commonplace as numbers get -- the sets
of rational or algebraic numbers are vanishingly small compared
to the transcendentals (first proven by Cantor.)
