Thanks for help getting Acoustic Stick out, Gary!

Rod Poole's CD I don't know.  Just released is a digitally re-mastered CD of
Blackwoods "12 Microtonal Etudes" and his guitar suite.  Only $11 from EMF...

(888)749-9998

..Needless to say, it's a Good'n!

Denny once told me of how these guys would take the Indian musican to the
lab, to try to measure what he played or sang.  He would play one thing
until they thought they had it, and then he would change what he was playing
without telling them to throw them off!  Gee, it was funny when Denny told
it.  Oh well, I guess you had to be there.

The state of the forum has caused in me some wierd feelings lately too.  I
find myself wanting to do the old and stinky thing myself.  But I try to
keep it constructive.  The recent discussion aside, there's always been the
part of me that gets fed up with all the talkin'.  That's why there's playin'.
