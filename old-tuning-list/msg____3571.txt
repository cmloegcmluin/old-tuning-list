Interesting.  Did they specify what they meant by "out of tune"?  

   I suppose it's worth cautioning the impressionable out there that, as with
the debate we've witnessed over whether the ear tends to gravitate toward Just
or stretched octaves, just because such a study suggests that we have some sort
of innate tuning preference, doesn't mean that other tunings aren't equally
useful.  

   After all, similar studies have suggested that babies have an innate fear of
falling, but that doesn't seem to stop humans from hopping into rollercoasters
and bunjee jumping, and such.
