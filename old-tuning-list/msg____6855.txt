Subject: quantum mechanics

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

Thinking a bit more about quantum mechanics and oscillators... the problem of
the quantum behavior of a vibrating string is essentially the same as the
problem of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity, the thermodynamic aspect of
which led Planck to his original hypothesis at the very origin of quantum
mechanics, back around 1900.

Classically we would describe the motion of a string by providing amplitudes
and phases for each of the modes of osciallation. As the string is coupled to
its environment, these amplitudes would slowly and steadily decrease as the
string vibrates a sounding board which radiates the sound.

Quantum mechanically, each mode of oscillation would not have a continuous
range of possible amplitudes, but a discrete range. These amplitudes would
not steadily decrease, but somehow they jump discretely from one amplitude
level to a lower level.

So it's the diminuendo, not the glissando, that gets broken into minute
steps!
