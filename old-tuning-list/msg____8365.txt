The software looks interesting, and is free in beta, $50 on release.
BUT it is Windows/NT only; no Macintosh version available.

I (and perhaps others on the list) would appreciate the courtesy of posting
platform info ahead of time; since our campus is entirely Macintosh,
Windows software is useless to me, and I wouldn't have bothered to search
for the AudioMulch webpage had I known its platform limitations.

Has it become automatic to assume that the Macintosh doesn't exist anymore?
It still seems the more robust environment for graphics and sound work in
the real world. I don't have the slightest intention of initiating a jihad,
but am curious as to the state of things.
