Subject: Programs for optimization of 12 tone tunings

From: Jeff Welty <jwelty@wdni.com>

Hello,

I'm new to the list (and tuning in general), so take that into account
please.

I have located various 12 tone tunings (i.e. equal temparment, Valloti, 
etc.)  and am curious how the tunings were arrived at.  It strikes me 
that this is a problem that can be solve with traditional mathematical 
optimization techniques.  Does anyone know of the existence of such 
software for a PC?  If not I am tempted to put together some code to do 
it myself.

Thanks in advance,
Jeff
