Subject: Touch-Tone continued.

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I forgot to mention that I once saw a booklet called something
like "The Touch-Tone Songbook." It gave a few simple songs
written in touch-pad notation. Fortunately, it also suggested that
parents make sure they or their children weren't acccidentally
placing calls to, say, Tashkent or Timbuctoo.

I supect all of this is an indication of the the elasticity of our
hearing and our willingness to assimilate unfamiliar intervals to
known ones in the certain contexts.
