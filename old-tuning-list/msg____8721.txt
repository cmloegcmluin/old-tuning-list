Subject: Conference proposals

From: Leigh Smith <leigh@antechinus.cs.uwa.oz.au>

As a microtonalist in Perth, Western Australia, voting for San Diego vs.  
some other U.S. city is voting for Mars rather than Jupiter...

It's not out of the question that I would make the effort to fly over  
(same sentiment as Lydia in HK, I understand), particularly as I expect  
to have a couple of more conferences to attend next year in the Northern  
summer. What would put me off is if I didn't think it was worthwhile, i.e  
if the conference was poorly organised, didn't have a good program of  
papers and concerts etc.

The Int. Computer Music Conference is a model of how such a conference  
could be organised, lunch and evening concerts, daily papers, keynote  
presentations.

I strongly suggest organising via an academic institution, with a widely  
selected panel of referees for papers and music (practictioners and  
theorists) to ensure it doesn't become an ivory tower.

The ICMC moves each year according to the hosting organisation. Given  
how cheap travelling in the U.S is (in comparison to Australia - I have  
to travel 4000Kms to get to another capital city, it's cheaper to get to  
Bali than to Sydney), I don't think the location within the continental  
U.S. should be the highest priority.

Regards

Leigh
