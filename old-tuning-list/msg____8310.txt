On closer inspection, you would probably find that the high frets on the
instrument were each used to produce a variable number of tones by applyi=
ng
more or less pressure. There are several traditional ways of fretting suc=
h
instruments (there are many different instruments in this 'family' and
considerable regional variation in names; identifying the one Paul Erlich=

heard would require a more detailed description), one popular way being a=

series of frets at 8/7 intervals. =


The ensemble Mr. Erlich described is curious - was there a So-na (double
reed instrument) in the group as well? If not, perhaps the saxophonist wa=
s
playing in its stead. (This would be similar to Sihanouk's replacement of=

traditional reed instruments with the saxophone in Cambodian Court Music)=
