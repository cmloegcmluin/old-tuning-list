It would appear that this list needs a good FAQ on some of the topics
brought up.  It should contain definitions of basic terminology and general
descriptions of the most common types of structures and scale generation
techniques.  From reading this list the past few months and browsing the
archives, it appears that many of the same topics get rehashed over and
over and over and over.  Some of the "tuning gurus" that inhabit the list
are surprisingly patient in explaining things repeatedly, but it seems that
they could save themselves some time by compiling these things into one
good document to stick onto someone's web page.  Obviously entire books
could be written on combination-product sets, etc. (and someone should do
so!) but at least some basic groundwork should be done for referring
commonly asked questions.  For example:

Why use equal temperament rather than JI (or vice versa)?
What is prime limit?  "" "" odd-limit?
What's a comma?
How is meantone tuned?  "" "" well-temperament?
What does MOS mean?
Where do I find information on tuning my synth/MIDI/guitar/piano/bagpipes
to scale X?
What's a harmonic series and what does it have to do with tuning?
What's a hexany/dekany/hebdomekontany, etc.?

I suppose if a really good definitive FAQ were compiled, 95% of the
discussion would disappear and the list would die.  Or maybe some of the
redundancy could be eliminated and the resulting discussions would be more
interesting with everyone (who takes the effort to read and understand the
FAQ) on an equal footing.
