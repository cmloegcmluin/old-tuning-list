Subject: Re: Melody and Harmony

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Melody: linear movement of pitch through time (left brain) represented by 
the non-temperament of Pythagorean tuning (adding successive fifths to each 
other in order to derive a scale)

Harmony: grouped pitches heard simultaneously out of time (right brain) 
represented by the non-temperament of Just Intonation (specific pitch 
relationships as found in the overtone series in order to derive a scale).
