Subject: personal opinion

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...I should probably stay silent, but I did want to
say my feelings concerning the problems that occasionally crop up
concerning McLaren. Since I started getting into the field a few
years ago, Brian has been more than helpful, sending me tons of great
articles to read, as well as numerous cassettes with micromusic of
all kinds...he has been very friendly and supportive of my music,
and has been quite willing, without any hint of ego, to help me in
my ongoing studies in this field. I am greatly sorry to see the bad
vibes that have appeared on this forum, because I truly do feel a sort
of brotherhood with everyone who is bold enough to step outside of
the 12 tone corner that western music is in today. I have also
found, through the years, that people with genius tendancies can
often be mighty complex folks, and occasionally a wee bit tough to
get along with...take a look at Hank Williams, Charley Parker,
Miles Davis, and a zillion others to see what I mean. Sometimes
the gift of art also brings along with it a few personal thorns as
well...I think sometimes that highly gifted folks are overwhelmed
with more data (feelings, emotions, intellect) then they can easily
integrate...it's like trying to put a 10 inch tube into a 4 inch
opening...it stretches one a bit. To see things that others do not
often means pain along with the beauty...I'm sure it can be tough
at times. I have been fortunate through the years to hang with some
mighty gifted folks, and sometimes they are a pain in the butt (I have
actually been accused of being difficult myself, at times...can you
believe THAT?) But, my most treasured times in this life have been
spent with those people who kicked me in the ass, and made me move
forward, because they ripped me a new one with the sheer audacity
of their talent, and made me realize that I did not want to be left
behind, or look like a doofbag. I am grateful to McLaren, and all
of you other gifted and heavy duty folks who hang out on this forum,
and try to pass along what pieces of your gift (and it IS a gift) that
you feel you can share...Hstick
