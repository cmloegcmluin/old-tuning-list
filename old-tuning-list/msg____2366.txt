From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

I have a non-commercial concert recording of Lou Harrison's music with no 
cover or date, and I am curious about a wonderful tune on it.

Is there a Harrison fan who can name a tune?  It is for gamelan and 
choir, and it begins with a baritone soloist's charming introduction 
about Virgil's writing.
