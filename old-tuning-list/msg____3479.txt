Subject: 7:4 versus...

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

On Aug. 26 Kami Rousseau asked:
>>What is your opinion on sevenths? What is the difference between 16/9 and
9/5? (I you tell me that the difference is a comma, I will have to kill you.
What I want to know is when to use the two different intervals.)

I haven't dealt with 16/9, but I'm a great believer in 7/4, 7/5, 7/6, and
their consonant, or at least relatively consonant, nature.

I really enjoy contrasting the 9/5 and 7/4 in seventh chords (tetrads)
built on the same root. In 12-ET, these two intervals are represented by
the 10th chromatic pitch, and our ears bend the pitch to best fit the
harmonic context. 

As proof of my previous sentence, and to silence any sceptics about the
importance of 7/4:

--create a pure 4:5:6:7 chord on your synth
--create a 4:5:6 triad, but add a 9/5 on top (9/5 * 4/4)
--create a 10:12:15:18 chord on the same root as each of the previous chords

After you are convinced thatchord #1 is smoother than chord #2, play
chord #1 and #3 one after another, and enjoy the perfectly consonant
harmonies with their thoroughly microtonal soprano line.

In ET contexts, 22 provides a good 7/4 (better than 19), and 27 and 31
are each progressively better yet.

Another ear-shock: 22 also has a very good 11/8. Try playing a
4:5:6:7:9:11 chord in 22, and you'll see what I mean. We all know that
in 12, we must omit the major third of this chord (5/4), but notice
how smooth this chord is with good 7/4 and 11/8 approximations!
