Can someone please give more information on these?


There have been some problems raised with pitch bend tuning:

MIDI transmits 3125 instructions per second.  A pitch bend is 3
instructions.  To send 16 of these takes 3*16/3125*1000=15.36 ms,
or twice as much if you include the note-ons as well.  Is this
really a problem?

That depends on your software, of course.  With GM, you're
limited to 15 melodic notes per MIDI stream.  It's quite
possible to go beyond this, but I've never wanted to.
