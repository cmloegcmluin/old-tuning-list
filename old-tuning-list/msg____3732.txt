Subject: guide to non-tempered synthesizers

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

Actually i believe that the Kurzweil k2000 and the new k2500 have the ability
to have each individual key tuned to whatever pitch you need. I've programmed
my k2000 for 19-tones et. it is however a tedious process to retune the
kurzweil. but if you put in the effort it's really worth it. the kurzweil is a
beautifulsynthesizer with some very realistic samples. additionally in terms
of tuning because every note is completely programmable you can say for
instance start on c1 program 19 pitches skip a few keys and repeat the process
starting on c3 and then again on c5 etc. this helps alot when improvising. you
tend to run out of keys a bit more quickly but on the new k2500 88key models
that problem is minimized.

goodluck,

denis atadan
