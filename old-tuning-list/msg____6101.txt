You're right, of course - a guitar fretted specifically for a given non-ET
tuning is not hard to tune to that tuning.  I should have said "re-tune"
rather than "tune."  I was thinking of the scenario of experimenting with and
writing in several different tunings using the same intruments.  Undeniably,
pressing a few buttons is easier that breaking out a tuning wrench or
refretting a guitar.

Sorry!  It's true, though, you know.  I listened to all of the arc-angel
pieces on your site.  They are good music if you like that style, but they
don't seem to especially highlight the tuning.  Not that that's a problem,
except that if one wants to hear what "tuned" pop music sounds like, he
should listen to a piece that really sounds or feels different than the same
piece would in 12-tET or what's the point?  But it was the only example I
could think of to point out to Peter at the moment.

Please don't take that as a criticism of Lucy Tuning.  I like it and plan to
use it some myself.  I applaud your success in extending Harrison's idea and
your efforts to promote the tuning.

Hey, Peter, now that I think of it, there is a Soundgarden song on
"Superunknown" called "The 4th of July."  I don't know what tuning it's in,
but it's not quite 12-tET!  It's a very modal, chant-like melody with guitars
tuned about 3-steps below normal and a lot of string bending.  Frightful
lyric but fascinating music.
