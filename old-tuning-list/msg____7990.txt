   I know only that, when Tom Stone's "Novatone" went under, Mark Rankin
said that they had a small outstanding debt to the company that custom-made
that wire for them.  They were holding the extrusion die they used to form
it hostage, so to speak.  I suppose it's fair to guess that Mark ended up
paying the debt to that company and bought the die, but I don't know that
for certain.

Gary and other Friends :

I would like to know what Novatone means.
On the other side it seems that the fretboards made by Mark Ranking have
the frets  glued on the interchangeable fretboards.
Does anybody know the Patent Number and date of presentation of the Thomas
Stone's on interchangeable fretboard, or other patents ?

Thanks

Eduardo
