Subject: Getting Airplay

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
        My brother (who reviews computer products for a living) has been
recording some of my tapes for me on  CD Recordable media, allowing 
me to have CDs of my music for the price of the media, about $10 to $15
apiece. This may be a good way to increase the chance of airplay for non-
standard music, for radio stations are far more inclined to play a CD 
than 
a tape. CD recordable drives are now below $1,000, and if you cant 
afford one, prehaps someone you know can run off a copy of your music 
from DAT to CDR.
				John Starrett
