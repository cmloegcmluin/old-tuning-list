The Frog Peak Collaborations Project: An Invitation
September 11, 1996

Frog Peak Music (A Composers' Collective) invites all composers to compose
a short piece (about 1 minute long) based on a 66 second soundfile of a
text written and read by Chris Mann. Frog Peak will produce a CD
compilation of these pieces.

to receive the source material
via the internet: A 66 second (about 6 MB) mono, 16-bit, AIFF soundfile may
be downloaded from the web at the following sites:

        http://online.anu.edu.au/ITA/ACAT/tjk/FrogPeak.aiff     (Australia,
thanks to Tim Kreger)

on DAT: Send a DAT tape (15 minute tapes are fine!) to Larry Polansky at
(before December 1, 1996) Music Dept., LaTrobe University, Bundoora,
Victoria, Australia 3182, or (after December 1, 1996) to Frog Peak Music.
Please write "Frog Peak Collaborations," your name and address on the blank
DAT, and include return postage.

Please copy this soundfile and invitation freely to other websites, hard
disks and digital media.

to submit finished pieces
Send DAT tapes of (approximately) 1 minute pieces using only this source
material to Frog Peak Music. The format must be 44.1, 16-bit, stereo AIFF.
Send as many pieces as you like. Please send the complete title of your
piece, your correct name and address, and any notes on the piece in
electronic format accompanying the DAT (Macintosh preferred).

We will try to put as many pieces on the CD as we can. Composers will
retain all rights to their own materials, and will receive two free copies
of the final CD.

the text
(The reason that something is an example, a fold (how many does it take to
define a problem? (, a predicate)), an economy of virtual knowns,
interrupts the idea of proof (those names of actions and events) that does
a shy redundancy, a wave. Looks like a subject, but. I mean, is
is-an-emergent-property-of-any-system-the-increasing-probability-of-asking-a
-right-question a question (a parasite that adapts) or no, a science of
quantity, a legal? And the additions? A function. Of represents.
Information after all is that failure of description, an immune system a la
consciousnessed, a parody (a typical number (probability is a product of
real numbers), a base maybe parity in bags) that dags as some inductive
random, a negative it, sit. Like a tautology is a square of the propensity
to explain any point-function as (random is just like absence) a factor (D)
of phantom flickers, a sort of they-type time (it disappoints (dusts)
description) of non-linear possibilities, an avvy quit. Shit. The
pragmatics of ignorance - something (decorative) you do on my time (my
reduction is smaller than your reduction coz I is a large number) - an
abstract that, an example of itself, a me-too no-risk of refers picks up a
difference on a stick (difference, the first good) and licks (self-evident
(a judgement is a perfect rule)): dear sames, a limbo (game) replica in
drag, as names (deduction is the administration of violence (credit is the
history (interest) of words without history)): claims it (the altruist) I's
about. Conspires. In (surrogate) two's. No doubt it queues.)
