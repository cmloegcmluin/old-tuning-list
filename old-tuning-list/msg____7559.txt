Subject: microMegas

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

I hadn't time to update microMegas (microtonal on-line revue) these times,
but I'll publish any new or reprinted article, sound samples, ads for
concerts or CD on microtonality...etc

The 3 first issues of microMegas are at:
http://www.teaser.fr/~daschour/micro.html

Please send me some materials and they'll be on-line soon.

Best,
Didier Aschour
