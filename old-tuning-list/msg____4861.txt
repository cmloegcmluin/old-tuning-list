Even allowing for some in measurement, this is definitely 
nowhere near the the series of fourths and fifths you 
predicted! Will you admit this?

Last post you said you could measure the frequencies of 
ghosttones without a tuner, using a metronome and a 
second string. Will you outline the exact procedure for 
doing this so I can proof your method?

I just reread it. You only posted the spreadsheet data 
with no explanation of the principle of beat frequencies.
Be sure to include it in the next post. Thanks.
