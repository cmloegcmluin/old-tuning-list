Change to "if less than a few cents" and the above statement would be 
accurate.  Just relationships are heard on a different level...a separate 
track form linear measurement by cents.

Today I learned a bit more about bagpipes than I would ever have before, 
so I understand your lack of involvement with woodwinds.  Contrary to 
what you might think, microtones are rather easily invoked by 
professional players.  One would be hard pressed to tell whether a 
microtone was played or a "normal" note.  I once played the slow movement 
melody of the Mozart Bassoon Concerto a quartertone low during a lecture 
in York, England and asked if anyone heard any microtones.  They answered 
assuredly - not at all.  I then told them that each and every note was a 
microtone and they were aghast.

Wherein an instrument can utilize tabliture, use it.  Guitar chords or 
Harry Partch Bass Marimba notation make sense because of the culture 
surrounding those respective instruments.  Cents notation as I've 
described it puts the player in the "ball park" so that they can 
appreciate the relative qualities of specific intervallic relationships.

For instance: if you want a player to play a 5/4 above a C, 
notate it as an E -14 and
the player will IMMEDIATELY understand the the traditional E is to be 
approached at a lower pitch level, thereby aiding in the understanding of 
placing the pitch _in relation_ to another.  If you want a player to play 
a 5/4 above a C +10, then notate an E -4.  Players would see that the E 
-4 is not so different than a traditional E, just shaded in a low direction.

If one uses cents combined with a basic quartertone notation, then it 
will not be necessary to "teach" players much at all, which will more 
than likely make them happier about participating in a new sonic 
adventure.  I think it is incumbant upon a microtonal composer that is 
writing for players to utilize the decades of learning that they have 
invested in their careers.  They will realize the justice of the new 
intervals.
