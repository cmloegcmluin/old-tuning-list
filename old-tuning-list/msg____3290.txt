Subject: The Reply, Part Two: Whither Harry...

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Ye tuning folks -

Onward with my discussion of Mr. McLaren's post from Digest 778, now 
concerning the "Li Po" recording...

> Now, 1 of the performances about which members of the British Harry

So do I.  I am pleased to have Ted and Stephen's version on my shelf, and 
ocasionally, in my CD player.

Welllll, it doesn't sound like Harry, and in that respect it doen't 
matter (more about vocal style in a minute...).  And, yeah, Harry was all 
over the map when he sang, which he probably knew when he sang it, so if 
the 'notes' are what we are about, then it is good that we have the new 
version to listen to.

Where on Earth did Mr. McLaren get these tidbits?  I have never heard of 
any anecdotal material detailing Harry's state of mind or amount of prep 
time leading up to the earlier recordings.  If there is a source for 
this, of course, I will consider it;  I have a suspicion that this is, 
um, not true.  And, yes, Harry did not have tuners and references; he 
just sang the songs he wrote.

Completely agree, except for the use of 'professional singer'.  How about 
if we substitute 'a singer trained in the European art song/opera school 
of technique'?  Please - I don't mean this directly as a criticism, and 
Mr. Kalm's vocal abilities are wonderful.  My point is:  Placido Domingo, 
Tom Waits and Perry Como [insert your favorites here...] are all 
'professional' singers.  The only thing I'll offer is that the tradition 
that Stephen Kalm comes from (stylistcally speaking) is the same "tight 
coat and tight shoes" tradition that Harry abhored, and this is where 
true die-hards might have a problem, his vibrato had me worried at first. 
 I expected to NOT like Ted and Steve's Excellent Adventure; they made a 
believer out of me.

I think I'll stop here; the next topic, the Krono "Barstow" has a lot of 
stuff to relate, and in the meantime people are coming out of the 
woodwork to smack me for my thoughts.  Cool.  BTW, I am getting the list 
in Digest form, so I am not *real* sure as to the best way to respond to 
people.  I've emailed Madole, but if anyone else has suggestions, let me 
know.

I hope this is a healthy discussion, with much more light than heat; I 
hold no illusions as to how many will be swayed (or interested...).

Yours in harmony,
Jon
