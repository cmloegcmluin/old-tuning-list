Subject: Denis Atadan's Tuning-List Tape-Swap Tape vs. Neil's Proposed CD

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

In a recent posting, I said (in response to Neil's idea of doing
something kinda similar on CD):

> The tape-swap had several problems that a CD would solve.  On the tape it's
> difficult to locate a particular composer and composition, which is espe-
> cially valuable on a contribution/collection work.

   Somebody who just now read that replied to me directly, concerned that I
was kinda insensitive to criticize Denis Atadan's work in producing the
Tuning-List Tape-Swap Tape - his work on the liner notes especially.

   Ziiiikes!  I certainly hope that nobody else got that utterly false
impression.  Let me assure all of you about two things:
1.  In saying that, I was only referring to the fact that on a CD you can seek
    a particular track by number, whereas on a cassette you obviously don't
    have that option.  I was not by any means suggesting that Denis did anything
    wrong with the liner notes.
2.  I am very pleased with and grateful for Denis' work on the Tuning-List tape.
    I think (and I know that many others feel the same) that it was a wonderful,
    pioneering effort.  I wouldn't be distributing the tape further if I didn't
    believe in it.

   So I'll say "thanks Denis for your efforts".  You did great!
