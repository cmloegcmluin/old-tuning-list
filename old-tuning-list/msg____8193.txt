Subject: Positive systems, Ogolovets

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Paul: I've had some discussion with Brian about the precise meaning of
"Positive" system. I prefer to follow Bosanquet and call any regular cyclic
system whose fifth is sharper than 700 cents (12-tet value) "positive," but
Brian claims that there is a widespread and growing convention of reserving
positive only for systems whose fifths are sharper than 3/2. I'll ask him
again for clarification next time I speak with him on the phone.

Brian is still trying to track down Ogolovets's articles. His major source
for the Soviet microtonalists is "Russian Theoretical Thought in Music,
