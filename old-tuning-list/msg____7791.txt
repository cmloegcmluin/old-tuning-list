Subject: Meraaker Clarinet

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Does anyone on the list know anything about the  'Meraaker 
Clarinet'? (Meraaker is a small region in Norway).

Its not my kind of music, but Jan Garbarek plays this interesting 
sounding instrument on a single track of a CD called 'Visible World'. 
I've written to ECM, no reply, and drawn a blank on the net.  The 
relevance is that Garbarek plays (and/or the instrument affords) some 
unusual scale elements, but the timbre is interesting as well.  
Anyhow, I'm curious.
