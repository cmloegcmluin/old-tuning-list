Subject: forum CD review

From: Neil Haverstick <stick@uswest.net>

The first review that I've seen of the tuning CD appeared in the new
Westword mag this week...log onto www.westword.com, and look for reviews
by Michael Roberts. I'd be curious to see what you folks think of what
he had to say...Hstick (PS...WW is a Denver based paper)
