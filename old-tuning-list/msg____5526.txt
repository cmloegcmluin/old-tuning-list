Congratulations, Neil! That's exciting news.

Are these acoustic basses uprights with frets or do they resemble acoustic 
guitars?

John Starrett has refretted my 7-string guitar neck to 22-equal and sent it
to me. Once I receive it, some work will still need to be done on the 
guitar. Then I intend to study and practice very hard. Although this means 
being a hermit for a long period of time, I am confident that it will pay 
off -- the music is already coming together on the keyboard, but I can't do
very much when I can barely span a "fifth" with one hand. The last ten 
years of teaching myself 12-tone guitar have been very fruitful in that I 
can comfortably improvise in a wide variety of diatonic idioms, plus blues 
and the occasional octatonic stuff. As good as people seem to think I am, 
the world is already saturated with great 12-tone guitar players; who 
really needs one more? Hopefully I can carry over some of my aural and 
technical skills to this new instrument. But it will take some time to 
unlearn diatonic thinking, and to forge an improvisatory style that is 
musical without being derivative. Maybe after ten more years I'll be onto 
something!
