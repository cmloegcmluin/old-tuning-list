Subject: Re: MIDI pitch bend

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

"On playback, though, I keep hearing the "bending" between each 
note.  How do I get it to attack each pitch without these 
little glissandi?"

You have to leave a small time delay between the bend command 
and the note you want to play bent. It varies between systems, 
but my PC/SoundBlaster 32 needs 20 ms. I assume that this is 
simply the processing time required by the microcode in the 
synth/soundcard. At present I tune 11 channels at the 
beginning of each recording and simply put a 1/16th note rest 
at the beginning, which seems to be adequate for all systems. 
It sure complicates the programming for tuning each note in 
real time!
