If you have a Macintosh, you can download JICalc from the Mills FTP site
(ftp://mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/mac/jicalc443.sea.hqx).  This will let
you send tunings to a TX802 over MIDI.  In the same directory are hundreds
of tunings compiled by John Chalmers in JICalc-readable form.  (These are
actually compressed text files, so you don't absolutely need a Mac or
JICalc to read them, but it makes it a lot easier.)

JICalc 4.43 is a new version with one minor change: scales can now be
displayed in cents relative to the 1/1, or relative to the previous tone in
the scale.  This feature should have been added long ago.
