---------I've got two fixed pitch instruments-----------

1) 6 foot grand piano (will soon be tuned Justly, but is now in 12)

2) Cosmolyra (built from scratch for about $100 under the guidance of Denny
Genovese at the Southeast Just Intonation Center)...
 a) Two-sided electric slide guitar after Ivor's Hobnailed Newell Post
 b) May be stood on end, on the floor, and played on either side
 c) May be put on side, on a table, and flipped to get at either side
 d) 33" of pine 2 x 6 (body) plus 1.5" (stands) is 34.5" total length
 e) String length 26", Harmonic 4 is the 12-tone F# below A=110
 f) 13 strings on side one, tuned to harmonics 4-16
 g) 15 strings on side two, tuned in three groups...
                6 in a otonal hexad
                6 in a utonal hexad
                3 in unison on harmonic 16 (chorus effect for melody)

 h) Body is marked on each side with 2 octaves of each of the following...
        otonal: 1/1    9/8   5/4  11/8  3/2  13/8  7/4  15/8  2/1
        utonal: 1/1  12/11  6/5  4/3    3/2      12/7         2/1

 i) Use of piano tuning pins in red oak and custom steel tail (with holes to
catch gromets on strings) allows high degree of tuning accuracy and stability.

I built the Cosmolyra mainly for ear-training purposes.  I have found that
it can also be used with good effect as a solo instrument, as a great thing
to sing along with, and even as a good instrument for ensemble work (a
recent jam with 12-tone electric guitar shows promise).  I may get around to
publishing full specs and even music for it (maybe in 1/1)...

---------I have five free pitch instruments------------

1) 1976 Bach Stradivarius Bb trumpet w/72 bell in silver
2) 1995 Yamaha Professional Heavy Wall Bb trumpet in silver
3) My voice
4) My whistling
5) Mollenhauer soprano recorder (wood)
