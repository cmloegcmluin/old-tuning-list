It won't help with the rotating component aspects of a leslie cab,
and, in fact, I don't even know where to look for something like that
off hand, but probably the best book around for the other aspects of
speaker cabinet design is "The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook" by Vance
Dickason.  I believe it is published by the folks who do "Audio
Amateur" and "Speaker Builder" magazines, but you can get it from
nearly anyplace that caters to amateur speaker builders, like
Madisound or Parts Express.

I've only designed one cabinet (yet to be assembled, so I don't know
how well I did), so there isn't much I could tell you that Dickason
wouldn't do a much better job at.  

Hope this helps,

Steve
