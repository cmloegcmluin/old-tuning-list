Subject: Midi Plea

From: curley@ucla.edu (Doren Garcia)

Hi all you groovy tuners,

I've been slaving at the design lab at UCLA so I havn't been paying
attention to the
forum, bummer. However, I have succeeded in inculcating many of the young pups
about this tuning thing! DeTwelvulate!

Anyhoo, I need some advice from my learned colleges.

I wish to experiment using 11tet or 13tet and transitionalizing to 12tet.
(hope I have the terminology right, I'm really not very good at this, and
it's probably changed by now)

I have access to a Kurtzweil 2000. I don't believe it has the capability to
do what I want. I believe it translates samples into 12 automatically.

Can anyone clarify? or suggest software?

I have decided it would be worth my while to learn midi. I believe Ensonic
keyboards have the ability to be retuned so I think I will begin to search for
an inexpensive used keyboard.

Can youse guys and gals suggest an inexpensive model? I have a PowerMac 8500,
and I am decent at software. Also have access to Protools, SoundEdit, and
Cubase.

Darreg Lives!

I love you folks, really,

Doren
