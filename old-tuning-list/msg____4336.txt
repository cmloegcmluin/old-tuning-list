Subject: Genesis of a Music question

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Here is one approach to Partch:

(1) Assume for the moment that he used stable and accurate instruments and
that all intervals in the book expressed as ratios are tuned precisely. (In
fact, he did a pretty good job under very difficult material
circumstances).

(2) Partch's _limit_ idea is based upon the series of odd whole numbers,
and his particular expansion of tonal resources was based upon adding
higher odd integers; some in the tuning community prefer to speak of
_limit_ in terms of highest prime numbers, some forego the term limit
altogether in favor of _genus_ (or set of generating factors). In Partch's
case, it is sufficient to think of a limit as the defined by the highest
odd number (x 2^n) used in either a numerator or denominator. The ratio
16/15, then, has to wait for a 15 limit to appear in a _diamond_ (Partch
includes it as a _secondary ratio_, to both fill in the gaps in his scale
and to allow some modulations, as well as an implied 15 limit tone
(although he called it _inharmonic_).

(3) As a music theory teacher, you may have probably noticed already that
Partch's harmonic scheme has three principals: expansion through a kind of
stacked third harmony, common tone chord modulations, and intervallic
inversion. (To my ears, this puts him smack in the mainstream of harmonic
practice and theory in the first half of this century.) In particular, the
use of  inversion will become very important to building his diamond, and
it is critical that he identifies inverted harmonic structures by their
_highest_ tone.

(4) There are a couple of ways of looking at the diamond. Here's one
without ratios: build a Major triad on c: c e g. Now invert these intervals
and build a minor triad _down_ from c: c ab f.  Next build similar minor
triads down from e (e c a) and g (g eb c)and Major triads up from ab (ab c
eb) and f (f a c). Note the shared tones between the triads, and the fact
that all contain c, but in each chord in a different function. This
arrangement is the diamond:

          G
     E       Eb
C        C       C
     Ab      A
            F 

And transposed to G is the same as Partch's 5-limit diamond.

A more generalized way of talking about the diamond is to think in terms of
a set of intervals multiplied by its inversion (a technique familiar in the
- albeit 12tet - music of Pierre Boulez), so we could map it onto twelve
pitch classes as:

0    4      7

8    0      3

5     9      0

which starts to look like the corner of a twelve-tone row box (who says
that Schoenberg and Partch didn't have anything in common?).

In Partch's case, we are talking about Just intonation, however, so these
pitches can be expressed as the ratios of small whole numbers in relation
to a given 1/1, or tonic.
In the five limit diamond, there are six triads, and each has a distinctive
odd whole number (again times 2^n, to make it all fit in an octave) common
to either the numerators of the minor triads (_utonalities_) or the
denominators of the Major triads (_Otonalities_). For example, locate the
minor triad with 5's in the numerator (5/4, 5/51, 5/3). Ignoring this
common tone, now, the denominators will show the _function_ of each tone in
the triad, which Partch called the _identity_: 5/4: 4 is 2^2, thus a 1
_identity; 5/5: 5 is the 5 _identity_; and 5/3: 3 is the 3 identity.  

Let me know if this was of any help...
