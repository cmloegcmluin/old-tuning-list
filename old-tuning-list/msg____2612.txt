William Sethares just sent me a private mail to explain that
he meant this statement just for laughs. Well not quite, he
told me something which I also find true, he said:

  > this is the kind of attitude that I get from musicians
  > whenever talk about alternate tunings comes up

What I also find is that musicians and audience always cannot tell a
difference between music played in tune and 12-TET (thinking
that they are the same). But they can tell "modified" tunings.

An example is my wife commented Gary's 19-TET piece sounding like
a band of small children playing their cheap recorders (Sorry, Gary).

I do not know what to say someone has missed if someone cannot notice that 
Heifetz, and a few others, play 100% in tune - on certain pieces.

Not just one string quartet member confessed on the "bowed-strings"
newsgroup that they spend 99% of their time on intonation. Harpists 
and harpsichordists complain of their having to tune their own 
instruments. They forget that violinists and singers have to tune
each and every note in real time. it is natural that we spend 99%
of our time on intonation.

Intonation is of course not just meant for "harmonious placement". 
It is meant for creating the sentiments of joy, sorrow, love, and
every possible sentiment of an artist's endeavour.

If you are still not bored, please congratulate me over my 6-year-
old daughter's winning yesterday second prize in an open schools 
piano competition, grade 3, among 54 competitors. Before, she won 
third prize at the same competition grade one at four, and another 
third prize in grade two at five. She has absolute pitch, but does not
realise that my violin intonation is different from the piano. She
tries to correct me even, sometimes. But when my Faure Sicilienne 
sounded so good, she bounced up and down like a ball.

Regards,
Linus Liu.
