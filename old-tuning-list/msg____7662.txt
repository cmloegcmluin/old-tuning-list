That's a good reason, but it would seem highly unlikely that the most
appropriate consistency level for this purpose would turn out to be an
integer, unless you had particular composite ratios in mind that you
care about representing consistently. It was the ratios of large
composite numbers I was objecting to, since treating them more carefully
than ratios of numbers with larger prime factors, even if the latter
numbers are smaller than the former ones, is something that those who
believe in prime characteristics will advocate, but I find no
justification for.
