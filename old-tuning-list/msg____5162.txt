   Yo!  (Actually probably only one of several I'd be willing to bet.)

   For whatever it's worth, consider that we can't see around buildings,
and yet radio waves can go around them fairly well.  Why?  Higher
frequencies of electromagnetic have greater line-of-sight dependencies than
lower ones.  Above the UV part of the spectrum, our atmosphere shields us
from just about anything from the cosmos, and most everything between UV
and microwaves are easily blocked by objects of daily life.  

   The effects of lower frequencies than that on humans are something of a
topic of debate these days, largely from the allegations that high-voltage
power lines have been causing brain tumors nearby residents.  (If you're
interested in that topic, Consumer Reports did a good report on the topic
something like a 9-12 months ago.)  

   For now though, precisely measured, widely-accepted cause-effect
relationships between electromagnetic waves and human medicine and
psychology are limited to direct sensory perception through our eyes,
temperature sensing in our skin, and that annoying hum in some of our
studios' cables (#@#$ *&%% @%$*!).  It would be foolish to deny that there
is SOME evidence of other effects, but those are clearly much more subtle. 
And there is theoretical reason to believe that these effects are as
limited as they seem since, as John Chalmers accurately put it, humans are
lousy antennae.
