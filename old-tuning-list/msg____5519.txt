Subject: JI modes

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

My words were chosen very carefully:

'' composing in various modes has been a continuous and central part of
>_musical training_''

Although the art repertoire indeed became Major/minor, the training with
the church modes remained quite traditional. Composers learned with Fux
well into the nineteenth century (and again in the late twentieth century:
indeed, the fashionable Schenkerian training is fundamentally Fuxian), and
the further one gets from the German repertoire the more one is likely to
encounter ''modal'' practices. You'll find plenty of examples in French,
English, Spanish, Northern, and Eastern European art musics, and Schumann -
to go to the center of the German tonal repertoire was extremely fond of
modal writing. (I don't know quite what to say about the German chorale
tradition where old, distinctively modal melodies are harmonized tonally -
this is still a standard exercise for music students). Above and beyond
this, the folk repertoires tend to be either only exceptionally or
nominally tonal! If the example of contemporary vernacular idioms is at all
relevant, one may be easily persuaded that modulating, functional tonality
held a leading position for a limited time in only a select repertoire, and
the greater part of music heard has been modal since - as my great
grandfather put it - Hector was a pup.

You wrote:

''By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers...''

For an alternative reading of the relationship between composers and
theorists, the chapter on ''Professional Theorists and their Influence'' in
Milton Babbitt's _Words about Music_ is certainly worth a look. We tend
nowadays to place theorists and composers in fixed positions with regard to
one another, and this simply does not bear up historically. In considering
any single theorist, one must be very careful to distinguish the aims and
limits of his (sadly, not often _her_) work and the audience to which the
work is addressed. One must often pry deeply to decide if a theoretical
work is descriptive or prescriptive, or if it is historical or speculative.
And then one must evaluate the influence - if any - that a work has had on
real music making. The persistance of species, modal counterpoint as an
element of musical training well into eras when the fashionable idiom was
very different is, on one hand, a testament to the value of the training in
the development of general musicianship, but is perhaps an expression of
deeper structural connections among repertoires whose material surfaces are
radically different. This is a point that intonational theorists and
microtonal composers desperately need to consider in detail (and is
fundamentally connected to the constant plea by list members for better
compositions!): devising new musical materials - a tuning, for example - is
not difficult at all; devising ''interesting'' or ''effective'' or
''convincing'' or ''musical'' ways of using those materials is extremely
difficult.
