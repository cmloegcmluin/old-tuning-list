Subject: NEWSFLASH

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Just in...the President today declared June 20 National Microtonalists
Day, and appointed Johnny Reinhard director of all Public School music
programs. He told Reinhard that his recent performance of Ive's Universe
Symphony "blew my shorts off". In a related story, Fender Guitars held a
press conference, and their spokesman John "Bo" Nerr said that they were
forced to end production of 12 tone eq guitars "ever since Neil Haverstick hit it so big with that 19 tone
crap"...at least 15,000 orders had been taken for guitars in non 12/eq
tunings. And, it has recently been discovered that Martian musicians
had a scale with 153,123 notes to the octave. Supposedly, Martian
musicians claim that the scale was "brought by the Old Ones".
