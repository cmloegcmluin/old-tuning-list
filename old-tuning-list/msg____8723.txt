Subject: Mathematical explanation of consonance? - Simple!

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

Yes, Robin. It seems to be determined by the number of steps between the
pitches on the "spiral" of fourths and fifths.

More steps - more dissonant.
Less steps - more consonant.

Simple, pragmatic and it works!
