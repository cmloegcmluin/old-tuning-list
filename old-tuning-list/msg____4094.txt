Subject: Re: More diatonicism

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

The 14 keys per octave being discussed refers to the Bosanquet 
description of an organ reputedly played by Handel.  When Handel 
inspected by th instrument in still retained shadows from where split 
black keys for Db-C# and Eb-D# had been plucked.  Bosanquet condered 
these shadows of the remains of a keyboard tuned to 14-tone per octave 
meantone.


Additionally, having played the Handel recorder sonatas on recorder, it 
occurs for a recorder to play a single note beyond the 12 note compass of 
a "standard" continuo manual, easily rendered by variation of fingering.
