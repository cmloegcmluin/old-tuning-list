I know there is a book by Stuart Dempster calle The Modern Trombonist, from
memory.  Stuart plays with Deep Listening Band amongst other groups.

Any interested trombonist with a good ear can do terrific things in JI as I
had in a concert recently of a piece of mine.  We played 7, 11, 13th
harmonics and so on in various keys.

Sorry I don't know what is meant by adaptive tuning techniques, but check
out Stuart.
