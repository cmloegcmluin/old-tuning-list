Subject: Xenharmonic Flute CD

From: jwf@muttley.ucsd.edu (john fonville)

>From John Fonville

My solo CD is now available. It includes Music by Ben Johnston
, Brian Ferneyhough, Joji Yuasa, John Fonville, and Salvatore Martirano. 
With Virginia Gaburo, piano and Anne LaBerge, flute. $12.00.

The Johnston is Twelve Partials for Flute and Microtonal Piano. 
The tuning is the 16th to the 30th partials of C (excluding 23, 25 and 29). 
FerneyhoughUs piccolo work Superscritio uses a few quarter tones, 
as does YuasaUs Bass flute work. Both are extraordinary pieces. 
My Music for Sarah is very xenharmonic but all of the tunings are 
derived from the fluteUs harmonics and altered fingerings. 
One movement explores the interactions of harmonics between 
the voice and the stopped tube which can easily go to the 13th partial.
 In another movement the head joint is removed and the flute is 
played much like a shakuhachi. The shorted tube has a semitone of 
about 130 cents. My flute duets Mong Songs are very xenharmonic.
 One movement is based on a 19 note per octave scale.
