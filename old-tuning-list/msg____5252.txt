Subject: poem about tuning

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net>

The Harpsichord list is running a thread about mentions of harpsichords in
literature --so I pulled my file about it. This one doesn't mention
harpsichords, but I thought you people might want to know:

The homely house, that harbours quiet rest,
	The cottage that affords nor pride nor care;
The mean, that 'grees with country music best
	The sweet consort of mirth and music's fare;
		Obscured life sets down a type of bliss!
		A mind content, both crown and kingdom is!

by Robert Greene (1560?-1592)
