The house I lived in in Massachusetts 3 years ago had an old set of
tubular chimes as a front door bell.  Whenever I sneezed (which is a MAJOR
acoustic event, and rather dangerous in fault-ridden California.....) the
chimes would sympathetically resonate with incredible vigor.  So, I echo
Lydia's observation of air-transmitted energy to the tubes.
