Subject: Harmonic Spectrums/Organ Drawbar Registrations

From: "Benjamin Tubb" <brtubb@cybertron.com>

I have Steven Irwins' book "Dictionary of Hammond Organ Stops: A Translation of
Pipe-Organ Stops Into Hammond-Organ Number Arrangements" which I would like to
further supplement with other similar books for experiments in additive
synthesis. Does anyone have an approach to how to modify such instruments for
non-12tet tuning spectrums? For example, given the following 11-drawbar pitch
definitions for four representative instruments of the Foundation, Flute, Reed,
and String families:

00 3525 010 10 Cathedral Diapason 8'
00 1401 001 10 Bell Flute 8'
00 7070 011 11 Clarinet 8'
00 1511 111 11 Orchestral Violin 8'

[Where the drawbar positions correspond to harmonic amplitudes within a range
from 0 to 9 for the following pitches: 16', 5 1/3', 8', 4', 2 2/3', 2', 1 3/5',
1 1/3', 1', 1 1/7' + 8/9', and 4/5' + 2/3'. There harmonics thus represented
when the fundamental is considered the 3rd drawbar are 1,2,3,4, 5,6,8,
Septieme+Nonieme, and Tierce+Quint.]

How would one adapt such registrations for "common" 5 or 7-limit Just
Intonation?
