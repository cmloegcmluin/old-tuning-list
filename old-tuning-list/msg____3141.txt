Subject: Tuning List Stats

From: madole@ella.mills.edu (David Madole)

Hey Tune-Towners,

Every now and then (as long term members know) when I am doing list
processor maintenance I like to procrastinate by taking stock of the
Tuning List and reporting to its' members some of the vital statistics
of the list.  There are currently about 350 subscribers, which is about
average for the last year or so, "representing" the following
nations/institutions/providers.  It is difficult to tell any more what
the national affiliations of many subscribers are because of the large
".com" contingent (suggesting... good things, I hope), but at least 24
countries are represented.  One thing that has become evident as time
has passed (29 months tomorrow) is the steadily decreasing predominance
of US .edu subscribers (in fact, of US subscribers in general).

Anyway, for what it is worth, here are current "institutional affiliations"
of the list's members, based on the domain names in their email addresses:

100 EDU US(?) Educational Institutions, 96 COM Commercial Providers
(not necessarily US), 20 UK  United Kingdom, 19 NET "Network", 13 ORG
"Non Profit Organization", 13 CA Canada, 12 AU Australia, 9 NL
Netherlands, 7 DE Germany, 6 AT Austria, 5 FR France, 3 SG Singapore, 3
SE Sweden, 3 NO Norway, 3 JP Japan, 2 MIL US Military, 2 HK Hong Kong,
2 FI Finland, 2 DK Denmark, 2 CH Switzerland, 1 ZA South Africa, 1 MX
Mexico, 1 IN India, 1 IL Israel, 1 HR Hungary, 1 GR Greece, 2 GOV US
Government, 1 ES Spain, 1 BE Belgium.

The list reports 3933 messages "on file".  The current archive contains
about 10.7 megabytes of... in-for-mation.

eartha is an SGI Indigo in a basement a hundred yards or so from the
Hayward fault at Mills College in Oakland, California, USA.

Some time later this summer the list processor will be moved to another
workstation.  This should be transparent to users but may involve some
downtime.  I will post a warning.
