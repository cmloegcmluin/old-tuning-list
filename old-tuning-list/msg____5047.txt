''If the 7th in a dominant 7th chord is tuned to 7/4, then it loses its
dissonance and instability. Indeed such a chord can function as a tonic
(as it does, quite exceptionally for the time, in Chopin's 22nd
Prelude).''

The category ''dissonance'' is, ultmately, contextual, and may not always
be the most useful arbitrator of musical functions. James Tenney's _A
History of Consonance and Dissonance_ is very useful in beginning to sort
out how variously such terms have been used. 

The most striking characteristics of a dominant seventh chord within an
otherwise triadic environment are - for me - the density of the chord (a
triad contains three interval classes, a tetrad six)  and the appearance of
a new (even ''xenharmonic'') interval. These features are enhancements of
the dominant/tonic voice leading relationship: root movement by fifth, and
stepwise ''resolution'' in the remaining voices. The introduction of a
raised third in the minor dominant illustrates the classical emphasis on
acoustical contrast between the chords.  When a dominant seventh chord is
suspended for a classical cadenza, it suffers little when tuned as 4:5:6:7
and indeed, the stability of the chord enhances its contrast with the tonic
triad. On the other hand, the suspension of a 16/9 (or 9/5) as the seventh
introduces a tone dissonant to the rest of the chord, but not foreign to
the scale. 

One often-raised objection to the septimal tuning is the narrow semitone
(21/20) voice leading from the seventh to the third of the tonic. I find
this line of argumentation more compelling, but the interval itself is not
difficult to sing - and if melodically ''strange'', it does maximize the
contrast function.

Readers might have some fun investigating the traditional rule of thumb for
the relative density of the chords in V7 - I cadences: In four voices, if
the voice leading is correct, then one of the two chords has to be
incomplete (that is with a doubled pc). (Why this should be so I will leave
as a kind of ''Puzzler'').
