Actually, I tuned C# and F# as eleventh partials, and Eb, Bb and Ab as
seventh partials.  After a little experimenting, I realized that all of
these notes were pretty useless below middle C, as they need to be
relatively high in a chord voicing to sound smooth.  So, then I went back
and tuned the black notes below middle C to more useful pitches.  That's
when I realized that I could also use different Ds above and below middle
C. 

I decided to use the D that's a fifth above G for the notes above middle
C, and the D that's a third below F for the notes below middle C because
the D below middle C is more likely to serve as a root of a ii chord (and
its advantageous to have a low note for a root) while the D above G is
more likely to be voiced as an upper voice.

BTW, I will be doing a presentation for the local piano tuners guild in
March demonstrating this tuning and a couple of pieces.

I also use this tuning to demonstrate intervals to my sight singing
classes.  Even the non-major class yesterday could hear the difference
between the 8:9 and 9:10 major seconds.  (And they really liked a Gershwin
excerpt of Prelude #2 which showed the 6:7 'blue' third!)
