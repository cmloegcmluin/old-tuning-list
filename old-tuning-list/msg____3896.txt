If you're speaking in terms of the intonation tables, resolution is limited
to 1 cent steps by software.  The value set in software is truncated, not
rounded, to the next lowest hardware resolution, which is on the order of
1/20 cent.  Transposing samples downwards 4-5 octaves or more reduces the
tuning resolution.

Changing pitch by other means such was the pitch wheel will usually be more
limited by the controller than the K2000 internals.  Most if not all of the
pitch wheels of current synthesizers have a resolution of only 7-8 bits, even
though the MIDI parameter has a resolution to 14 bits.
