Indeed so, and your theory is entirely consistent on this point.
However, I stated that I prefer to keep to triads when using 7-limit
harmony, and I also like to keep the 5-limit consonances.  We have
an aesthetic disagreement here, but nothing worth arguing about.

Now, Mr Gibson on the other hand:

Gregg, I'm getting sick of this.  I say a chord has a degree of
consonance because of its sound, and you tell me it is a dissonance
because of one of its intervals.  I have justified my viewpoint,
and you have simply ridiculed it.  You have never given any clue as
to what these chords sound like, and therefore what property of that
sound you consider to be dissonant.  Neither have you given a
definition of dissonance.  As you began the discussion, the onus
is on you to explain what you mean.

You _have_, it is true, said that you do like 7-limit chords.
However, the fact that you advocate a tuning in which they are
poorly approximated deserves explanation.

In this particular case, you have not answered my point.  Look
carefully.  I did not say any chords were consonant.  I said
thay were more consonant than the worst of their intervals heard
as a dyad.  Do you agree?

If you add F# to the 5-limit triad C-E-G, you get an undoubtedly
dissonant chord.  The 7-limit is special in that adding an octave
can sometimes dramatically affect the sound of a chord.  However,
you have never said this.

FWIW, 3:4:6:7 sounds more consonant than 4:6:7.  4:6:7:8 is clearly
more dissonant than 4:5:6:8, but is much less so than the triad
6:7:8.  Do you agree?

I've already said that a binary consonant/dissonant argument will get
us nowhere.  I find that a small amount of tempering (ie, 41 equal)
can improve the sound of these chords.  Do you agree?

Gregg, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! stay with in the constraints of the English
language!  The terms "absolute" and "relative" are diametric opposites.
What on earth does "absolutely relative" mean?  What are these
acoustical reasons, and what are the physical constraints that I
am violating?  Or, are you again making unspecific accusations of
straw men?

Paul Erlich's argument is not in the least invalidated.  He did not
declare any chord to "be" consonant.  His argument is, in fact,
very good.

To move away from music for a paragraph.  Gregg has stated Paul's
tone to be "insolent" in this discussion.  I, on the other hand,
feel Paul has very patiently attempted to make Gregg see the
omissions and inconsistencies in his argument.  Gregg's attitude
in the exchange, however, I find to be highly offensive.  He has
never considered Paul's ideas, as published on the Internet, and
I suggest he has not even read that paper.  It would be a simple
courtesy for Gregg to spell Paul's surname correctly.  I make these
points in case Paul's modesty or civility prevent him from doing so
himself.  While I'm at it, to state that a tuning system is
"useless" is offensive to people who use that tuning system, and
who place value on their aesthetic judgements.  I have certainly
been offended by much of what Gregg has said.

Which, of course, it does not, as it is only a 9-limit interval.
I have taken care not to step outside the Partchian 7-limit.  I
have also made clear distinctions between 7-limit chords.  I'm
not saying stupid people can write 7-limit music, simply that it
deserves exploration.
