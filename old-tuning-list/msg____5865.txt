Certainly, the interval 5/3 sounds sweeter than 27/16, when each is sounded
in isolation.  I seem to have omitted a necessary part of the context -
sorry.  I was referring, not to the tuning of intervals themselves, but to
the tuning of JI scale members, used for tonal music.  If you built a minor
triad on the second scale member, and it was tuned to 9/8, the chord would
obviously be more consonant with a 27/16-sixth-scale-member
fifth-of-the-chord than a 5/3 one.

To restate, then, if all of the members of your scale are made up of ratios
involving 3^x, and possibly other primes and their powers, but not 5^x, then
a single note on the 6th of the scale, tuned to 5/3 or any ratio involving 5,
would sound out of place.  It could be used, though, as an intersection, a
corner around which to turn into a passage involving more scale members using
5^x in their ratios.  I've experienced this.  I'ts like the first time in a
piece that has been 5-limit (prime) up to that point, that you use a true 7/4
- zow!  But if you continue to use more ratios involving 7, it looses its
shock value and comes to sound quite pleasant.  I doubt that a 9/5 or 16/9 in
the same situation, if all 9s had been avoided up to that point, would come
as such a shock, even though 9>7.  I believe that that is because 9 _is_ 3 3s
- it contains 3s, for all rational purposes.  I have yet to see a convincing
example of the use of a ratio involving 9 where it did not function and sound
like it was part of the prime dimension based on 3.
