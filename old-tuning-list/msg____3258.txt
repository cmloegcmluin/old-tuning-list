I'll sure admit that my direct experience here comes from a one-time
teacher and gamelan tuner (A.L. Suwardi), but I was under the impression
that at least one or two of these embats referred to the distance between the
wider and narrower intervals - that is, the distance between 1-2, 2-3, etc.
rather than octave stretching or narrowing as such. And I could also be wrong
here, but I'd be surprised to discover that there wasn't some considerable
variation from instrument to instrument among the set of instruments as
well watching A.L. retune out set, something like that sure seemed to me to
be going on....

Selamat pagi,
Gregory

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
