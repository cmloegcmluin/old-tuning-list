Dear Playlist Subscriber,

I'm happy to announce that WFMU IS NOW BROADCASTING LIVE 24 HOURS A DAY
ON THE WEB.  The fidelity's excellent (even better than reception in
many parts of NYC), and it's free--absolutely no strings attached.  All
you have to do is put up with one lame Audionet ad (fifteen seconds or
so) before the broadcast starts, and that's it. From there on, it's
WFMU's actual live broadcast.

The feed uses "streaming audio."  If you're not familiar with it, it
basically means that you can listen to an effectively infinite broadcast
without downloading huge sound files to your computer first, or needing
tremendous amounts of hard-disk storage.  Just push the button and
listen for as long as you like.

In the four years or so that I've been posting my playlists to the net
and web every week, I've gotten hundreds of email messages from people
around the world bemoaning the fact that they can't pick up the station,
or from former listeners who've moved and miss being able to listen.
More recently, people have been asking me when we're going to start
broadcasting on the web.  Well, the answer is: Right now.

Point your web browser at:

http://www.audionet.com/radio/ram/wfmu.ram

To listen, you need a copy of the RealAudio player, available for free
on the web. To download a copy, go to:

http://www.realaudio.com/products/player.html

WFMU's home page is at:

http://www.wfmu.org

This hasn't been publicly announced yet (I wanted to tell you folks
first).  An all-out media assault starts tomorrow.  Feel free to spread
the word.

Thanks to all of you for your continued moral, electronic, and emotional
support.

   --Dave.
