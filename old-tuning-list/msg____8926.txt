   Ah, Good point.  Then again, I suppose it might be worth asking whether the
term "microtonal" means much to the proverbial "average Joe" either.  

   I think that "The Experience" is catchy though.

   The last time I assessed the costs was back in 1992, when I did the graphics
for the Ivor Darreg CD.  In those days anyway, that came to about $1000 more
than you estimated.  It wouldn't surprise me of they've gone down since then
though.
