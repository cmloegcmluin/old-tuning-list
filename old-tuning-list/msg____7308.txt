Subject: Re:microtonality in popular music

From: steele <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

OK,I'm a bit late with my two cents,but.......
Regarding what's been written by Johnny Reinhard and others about the 
faint,but looming spectre of microtonality in popular music:
Firstly I 've thought  of it as somewhat inevitable (when is the last 
time you heard an original ,as in never heard before,melody/harmony on 
the radio or on ,ye gads,TV?
A casual listen to  the things being released today show (to me anyway)a 
rising desperation.The 
'Jungle/Drum&Bass' scene seems to me to be a natural result of the 
impossibility of writing a 'new'
song in 12 TET.

But my main reason for writing (other than the fact that I'm a beginner 
,ergo more of a list voyeur)is this: microtonal/Xenharmonic  music is not 
something one can pretend to be competent/good at
(no pseudo-blues pentatonic riffs,or (why do they call it that) 
licks).Therefore the obvious solution will be algorithmic generation of 
musical parts (a tech-nerd version of auto-accompaniment),sample
CD-ROMs (not multi-samples,but actual performances,ala those George 
Clinton collections),etc.We'll all be in trouble.I'd hate to hear a 
Partch/Darreg/etc. sample on Will Smith's latest "Cashing in on 
M.I.B.&ID4" ditty ,or aimless arpeggio-type patterns driving some dance 
music craze (the commercial music business is good at messing up a good 
thing,look what happened to 'Jungle/Drum&Bass')

Something to mull over ?

Of course,feel free to disagree,call me an idiot, and get on with you 
buisness.
