There is also an article that provides a quantitative analysis of the
inharmonicity of piano strings:

   ABSTRACT: Inharmonicity is a well-known property of stiff strings such
             as those used in the modern piano. The inharmonicities
             measured in a medium-sized grand piano are in excellent
             correspondence with the predictions by formula from the
             physical properties of the strings. Strings with higher
             frequencies usually have higher inharmonicity than strings
             with lower frequencies; this cancels out part of the effect
             of inharmonicity on beat frequency.  (Authors, abridged)
