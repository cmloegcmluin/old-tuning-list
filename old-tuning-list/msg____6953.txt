Subject: Favourite recordings

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Carl listed some favourite albums with intentional tunings_  Just
wanted to contribute some of mine -

Luigi Nono, Prometeo - Tragedia dell'ascolto, (Ingo Metzmacher et al.,
EMI 7243 5 55209 2 0 ) (2 CDs) (To me, one of the greatest works of
the 20th Century).

Luigi Nono, A Carlo Scarpa architetto; No hay camonos, hay que
caminar; (Micheal Gielen, Sinfonieorchester des Sudwestfunks, Astree
E8741) (CD)

Giacinto Scelsi, (1905-88)	Anahit (Carmen Fournier Violin, Jurg
Wyttenbach Cond.,  Orchestre de la Radio-Television Polonaise de
Cracovie.  Accord 200612) (CD)

Bill Hopkins, (1943-81)  (Alison Wells soprano, Richard Bernas cond.,
Music Projects/London, NMC D014)  (CD) (Hopkins was pupil of Jean
Barraque, and he was my own composition teacher).  (Not all
microtonal).

Harry Partch,  Study on Archytas' Enharmonic (John Schneider Guitar,
Amy Shulman Harp, Bridge BCD 9041)  (CD).   (I'm not a huge Partch
fan, and I suspect this is not an `authentic' performance - but I love
this rendition.)

Lastly, I wouldn't call this  a favourite - but I add it as a
curiosity :

Pierre Barbaud, French Gagaku, (Orchestre Radio Television de
Strasbourg, cond_?) (LP))  (Sorry, haven't got any more details on
this - I only have a tape of it. But I know the LP exists.  Does
anyone on the list know much about Barbaud's music? This is the only
thing I've heard.  I think he was an early-microtonal-computer-
algorithm-composer_)

The tunings of all these (except Partch and Hopkins) are 1/4 tone
(I think Prometeo is notated in smaller divisions also, but the score
is not available to purchase).  The Hopkins is notated with
arrow-heads attached to conventional accidentals.  They are described
as 'quarter-tones' but it is fairly clear he didn't mean strict
24-ET.  In the solo violin piece on the disk (which is 'post-serial')
the tunings aspire to a kind of bird song.
