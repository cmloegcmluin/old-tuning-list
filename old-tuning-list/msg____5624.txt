One possibility: consider pythagorean to be a subset of just, and the
normal staff notation to be pythagorean extending by fifths/fourths
indefinitely in both directions with sharps and flats as usual but without
the 12tet equivalence classes. For each prime number higher than three
introduce two modifying symbol for raising or lowering a tone by an
interval (comma) where the new prime(2^n) is super- or subparticular to
3^n(2^n). E.g. a plus or minus sign to indicate raising or lowering by
81/80, rightsideup and upsidedown sevens for the septimal comma etc.. Allof the symbols can be combined freely. The advantage of this method is that
all intervals are notated invariably. Players can learn the music by
learning the intervals directly and the ''null position'' for pythagoreanintonation is relatively easy for string players.

One alternative is - a la Ben Johnston - to assume that a just diatonic
scale is the null position for the staff notation. In my opinion, the chief
disadvantage to this is that intervals are not invariably notated,  but
vary in notation relative to the a given tonality.

Another notation is to use the 12tet pitches and to indicate cent
deviations in numbers. I find this a fine auxillary notation, but since Iconsider the rational relationships to be an essential part of a work's syntactic content, chose to limit this usage to an auxiallary role. (I
admit to one great exception: my second String Quartet uses cent-deviation
notation; the sixteen strings are tuned to octave multiples of the first
sixteen primes, and - aside from natural harmonics - are unstopped, a
pythagorean basis for the notation seemed to be beside the point.    Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
