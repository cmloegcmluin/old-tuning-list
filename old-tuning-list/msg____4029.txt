Really? I think diatonic melodies in 17 are quite beautiful. Witness 
Blackwood's 17-tone etude, for example. By avoiding major triads in 
structural places, he makes the piece work wondefully. Take a simple melody 
in a major mode and play it in a tuning where the half-step is 1/4 or 1/3 
the size of the whole step (22- and 17-tet, respectively). Sounds great to 
me! As soon as you add the slightest bit of harmony, say a tonic or dominant 
drone, YUCK! Actually, minor modes in 22 work pretty well, since the 
Pythagorean minor triad there closely approximates a 6:7:9. Randy 
Winchester's 22-tone improvisation works beautifully on this principle.

I'm putting some finishing touches on a Xenharmonikon paper right now, and I 
just happened to note that theorists who derive the diatonic scale from 
three triads are perpetrating a historico-geographic fallacy. The diatonic 
scale happens to have lots of good triads in some tunings, but it is a 
melodic entity first and foremost. Otherwise, why don't we find a 5-note 
scale that is derived from two triads, or a 4-note scale that is derived 
from three dyads (perfect fifths) in use anywhere?
