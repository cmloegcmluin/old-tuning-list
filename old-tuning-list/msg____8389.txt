Subject: Re: my microtonal page

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Greetings! 
	I have redone my microtonal page at
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html
and in the process I lost my information on microtonal groups. If anyone 
plays in or knows of microtonal groups with homepages, I would appreciate
you forwarding them to me so that I may rebuild this section. Thanks for 
any help.
