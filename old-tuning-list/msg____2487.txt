I suspect that Marion McCoskey's methodical survey of JI is perhaps a good
direct example of what Matthew's was looking for in methodizing new-tuning
resources.  (Harry Partch didn't - or so it seems to me anyway - do a methodical
survey of tunings, as much as he created an innovative new musical world and let
his mind play in it.)  That along with the folks he already, like Easley
Blackwood.  Ivor Darreg did an even more complete survey of equal-temperaments
in his Xenharmonic Frontier, Multiples of Five, and Multiples of Seven studies.
(Some of that is in his CD, by the way.)  But perhaps more importantly, he
investigated and published methodical suggested approaches to composition in
those tunings.  

   It's kind of odd in a way:  I both strongly agree, and yet somewhat disagree,
with Matthew's view of the importance of methodically evaluating
the various new-tuning possibilities.  That makes a lot of sense with regard to
making sense of the chaos, and guiding people with certain inclinations toward
appropriate tunings.  The balance to that though is the creative zing we often
get seemingly from nowhere - I call it divine inspiration - in doodling around
with a given tuning.  That doesn't have much to do with methodical
investigation, neither with respect to locating an appropriate tuning, nor with
respect to the composition process itself.  Some of the best compositional and
listening inspirations I've had were totally inexplicable best I can tell.
