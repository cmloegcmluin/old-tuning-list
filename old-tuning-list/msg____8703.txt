   I doubt it, frankly.

   I have no doubt whatsoever though, that a lot of us can suggest
mathematical definitions of something we want to *call* consonance.

   But defining consonance itself is somewhat like defining beauty.  Not to
suggest that it's synonymous with beauty, but just that it's an experiential
quality that depends on far too many considerations to be quantified.

   Or let me rephrase that in terms similar with Bill Sethares' book:  There
are physical and perceptual qualities of sound and music.  Logarithmic
amplitude is a physical quality, and volume (loudness) is a perceptual one. 
Logarithmic frequency is a physical quality, and pitch is a perceptual one.

   You'll probably find a good 25-30 or so mathematically-formulable and
physically-measurable phenomena that will be called "consonance," or something
like that.  But don't confuse it with actual consonance, because that's a
perceptual quality, not a physical one.
