I have written an article about that--no conclusions, but it discusses the
pros and cons of what is out there. If anyone is interested, please let me
know and I'll wire or mail one to you.

Also, for those not on Newband's mailing list, I'll anounce a concert of
Dean Drummon's "The Last Laugh," for Newband accompanying silent film.  It
is for large ensemble including all of Drummond's and 9 of Partch's
instruments:

3/11/98, 8pm: Library of Congress, Wash. DC (202) 432-SEAT
3/14/98, 8pm: The Kitchen, NYC (212) 255-5793
