Subject: Re: Systematizing Tuning Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I suspect that Matt Nathan and I are saying the same thing in two
different ways.  Matt is concentrating in particular on tuning systems that
have an indefinite number of pitches, like JI or meantone tunings.  

   Those are systems though.  In meantone, you always choose notes on a
circle of a fixed-sized fifth, and similarly in 5-limit JI you always make
major triads take the form of 4:5:6 (or with one or more notes
octave-displaced).  (I'm calling the 81:64-based major triad a 3-limit JI.)
 

   But if we're not saying the same thing, then let me suggest that the
analogy I posed between particle physics and tunings is based on a
similarity between laws of harmony and counterpoint, and the laws of
physics.  Picking pitches chaotically makes it more difficult to create a
sensation of inevitability and thus logical resolution in a cadence.  

   The traditional form of tritone resolution (leading tone upward, and
seventh down) is based largely upon the hindsight-obviousness of resolution
by half-steps to a quintessentially less discordant interval.  A lot of
what makes that so much sense, is simply that 12-toned systematics
convinces us that half steps are the smallest possible pitch difference. 
The fact that the tritone is so dissonant and yet so close a consonant,
makes us hear that resolution and say "ah yes, how could we ever imagine it
otherwise".  That's a lot of what makes that resolution satisfying.  

   Similarly, in science, the best-accepted ideas are ones that have a
sense of hindsight-obviousness.  Scientists, and to a fair degree musical
audiences, like hindsight-obvious relationships between pre-known elements.
 It's much harder to deal with something that requires you to accept an
all-new axiomatic idea.
