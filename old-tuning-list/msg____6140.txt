Beware that Pitch Palette does NOT support the MIDI Tuning Dump standard per
se!  The standard is too slow for the on-the-fly retuning that their program
does.  To retune takes 408 bytes or about 130 ms. which is much too slow.  I
asked them about the Ensoniq MR rack which they do support.  It retunes via
the MIDI Tuning Dump.  Ensoniq in their superior wisdom designed the MR
series with a shortcut mode where you need only send one octave worth of
tuning data, 50 bytes or about 16 ms.  Great, for octave repeating tunings.

Even the MIDI Real Time Single-Note Tuning Change takes 8 bytes plus 4 bytes
multiplied by the number of notes to be changed.  This might work but the
program would have the added complexity of having to select which notes need
to be retuned first in the context of the music.

I went through all the trouble of looking for a sound card (Turtle Beach
Tropez+) that supports the MIDI Tuning Dump standard only to find that the
standard is flawed for many applications.  Or is it MIDI in general that is
flawed for microtonal applications?
