And what does that have to do with it?  Your first post stated that
keyboard instruments were unreliable indicators of tuning practise
because the tuning was perishable.  Organs are a direct counterexample
to that idea.  They hold their tunings, not perfectly, but amazingly
well, and if they have been modified it is usually possible to find
evidence of it.

This only works if you are willing to use more than 12 pitch-classes, as
Gary has already pointed out, and which builders historically have not
done.
