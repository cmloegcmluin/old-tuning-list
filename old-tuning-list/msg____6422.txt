Subject: Re: Microtonality on Woodwinds

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

The following are my observations of the flexibility, reliability, and
vitability statistics for woodwinds:

Flute:  open-hole flute a must for reliability.  Rober Dick has built
an open-hole bass flute.  Wooden non-keyed flutes can have the
termperament altered easily through the careful placement of scotch tape
over parts of the open tone holes at the necessary angles.  The flute is
quite versitile.  Some of the "altered" pitches have an airyer or thinner,
almost discolored quality, more similar to wooden flutes sounds, but more
pronounced.

Oboe:  great promise for circular breathing multiphonic development.  If
the musical ear hears the relationship, the oboe is quite obediant.  My
oboes solo _Melanin_ will be premiered by San Francisco oboist Brenda
Schuman-Post this Dec. 12 at the Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 E. 65 St, NYC.)

Clarinet: even with the bass clarinet's keys it's fairly flexible.  The Bb
commoner is quite rich in its possibilities. There is nothing impossible
to accomplish with reliability and evenness of tone on the clarinet.

Bassoon: my microtonal baby.  It give me everything that I ask of it.  Our
love affair will continue as long as it continues to surprise and reward
me in our musical partnership.  It's all in the fingerings thanks to both
open tone holes and 26 keys, and a 3.5 octave range, and a rich
fundamental laden tone, etc. ;)
