   That is (presumably) true, but I think it's worth noting that it's one
of the few mass-market synths that supports the official MIDI tuning
standard, which I believe includes intricate provisions for dynamic
retuning.  

   Steve Curtin, who was largely responsible for writing the firmware for
that capability but who no longer works for Ensoniq, can give us more
details.
