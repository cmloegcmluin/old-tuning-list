Solo unaccompanied singing is the last place you're going to find JI
scales. Without harmonic intervals, the stronger guiding forces will be
melodic shape and expressive intonation. The table in Ear Magazine East
is a nice illustration and contains few errors, but does not impart any
real understanding of the scales in question, why they are tuned the way
they are, or when one would use the notes given and when one would
substitute other notes instead. It might not be a bad idea for you to go
all the way back to Helmholtz for a thorough understanding of the tuning
of scales. Partch is not a bad reference either. Then you can make your
own tables according to your specific musical contexts.
