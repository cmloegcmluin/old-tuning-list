Subject: Re: Neanderthal flute

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

I agree with the challenge to the speculation that one can infer a tuning
from an instrument that has lost its mouthpiece to time.  This was the
problem with Schlesinger's Greek Aulos computations...interesting numbers,
however with no genuine relation to the double-reed instruments because
they don't take into account embouchure, reed length, etc.

On the other hand, the dating of this item and concurrent attribution to
the Neanderthal line of primates is quite significant.  The debate still
rages whether we are descendents of this line, or not.  I've heard some
impassioned commentary regarding unscientific distortions of Neanderthal
jaws, which are pushed out past their physiogamic relationships so that
they seem more foreign to our own.

A joke making the circles now is that early music is older than people.
