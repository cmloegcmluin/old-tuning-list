Subject: Clavette's future development

From: Harold Fortuin <hfortuin@wavefront.com>

For several months I was hoping to interest the University of Minnesota's
Dept. of Electrical Engineering in helping me build a velocity-sensitive,
expanded Clavette microtonal MIDI keyboard controller.

Unfortunately, my plans to apply for grant funding died of neglect
on their end.

I'm currently exploring some ways of making a simplified version of the
existing
keyboard available. I'm also looking into selling the pedals in a separate
package.

I'll keep the listed posted on significant future developments.
