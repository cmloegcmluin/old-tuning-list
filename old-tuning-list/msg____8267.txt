Subject: Re: Overtones and Tone Color

From: <Nangaku@aol.com>

Can somebody in this forum help me understand the concepts of overtones and
tone color?  For example, A440 produced by a tuning fork consists of
vibrations having frequencies of mostly A440. But A440 played on a piano or a
tuba will have more overtones, frequencies that are multiples of 440  - 880,
1320 etc.  This is were I lose it. Are overtones different frequencies
produced by different aspects of whatever materials are producing the sound?
So if the sound is being created by simpler materials such as a tuning fork,
the will be fewer other frequencies involved, whereas if the sound is created
by a piano, the hammer and string are more complex materials and therefore
have more frequencies or overtones?
