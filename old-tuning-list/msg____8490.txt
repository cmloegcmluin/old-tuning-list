Subject: Post-TAGFest '98

From: David Beardsley <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

Since someone asked me to post a report description to the list...

Aside from a tin ceiling and some ceiling fans that rattled like
crazy when ever I hit low notes, the performance of Sonic Bloom
went fine. Sonic Bloom is a 30 min. algorithmic piece for synth, I
use a Roland guitar synth as a controller and various digital delays to
sustain the notes. While SB is based on a
seven note scale of 1/1, 9/8, 7/6, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4 - the work also
has a lot to do with the synth patch I devised, a grand piano with
the attack rolled off. What was originally a quiet piece with pauses
and space when I conceived it in Fall '97, Sonic Bloom turned into a
thunderous wall of rumbling piano in the week of rehearsals before
the premiere.

Festival attendance was down from previous years, my guess is
that festival organizers just couldn't get it together this year.

Virgil Moorefield's 48tet free improv. band played out in the park,
I just barely caught the end of his set.
