Subject: Story of Harmony

From: "Anne L. Coulombe" <acoulombe@sciplan.com>

Just reread a great new book called "The Story of Harmony" by Rex Weyler 
and Bill Gannon. The Neanderthal flute just happens to be in the 2nd 
Chapter just after describing the 1706 "tuning showdown in Jena, 
Germany" (two sets of church organs pipes, two renowned choir masters, 
two musical paradigm clashed on that day...). The rest of the book 
covers Pythagoras to today's new composer/musicians.

Their web site has a good description of their current software and 
upcoming synth solution to real-time pure harmony, although the book 
goes much more into depth regarding the evolution of harmony over the 
years. You might wish to check them out at http://www.justonic.com or 
even send Rex an e-mail at rexw@justonic.com

I've heard some of the classics as well as some new work played using 
the Justonic Pitch Palette system and the harmonies are pure. I did find 
that "The Story of Harmony" really openned my eyes to what I knew I was 
hearing, it definately renewed my preference in a harmonic tuning 
method.
