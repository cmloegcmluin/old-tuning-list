While I freely admit that I did not know this article (Heinz Werner,
J. Psych. 10 (1940)149-156) I cannot say that the result comes as a
surprise.  Many years ago I was faced with a small-interval set of
strings, and I quickly found that the tunes which interested me were
all within a major third.  Similar effects have occurred since, and in
my last completed (OK, only completed) microtuned piece the parts I
really like are the melodic fragments with very small intervals.  This
does not seem to correspond with the JT systems or the various 12ET
approximations.  I want to listen to more notes, and closer notes.

Talking to Rick Boulanger earlier this year he suggested that as so
much information in speech is conveyed by small inflections, it was
not unexpected that small intervals could be so inviting.

Still, I like pickled okra (mathematical joke) and various other
unpopular things.
