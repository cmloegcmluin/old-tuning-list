Subject: Re: McLaren contra Taylor (from Brian)

From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu>

Not to bust the whole ugly subject wide open again, but I do feel that
someone who spends 200+ lines defending himself against (among other
things) a charge of antisemitism that Greg never made, then turned
around and compared Greg to Nixon, who just a few days ago referred to
current music education practices as "Naziistic" and "Orwellian", etc.
etc., is certainly living in a greenhouse as far as throwing stones
about "rhetorical excess" is concerned.

MHO.  Now back to your regularly scheduled tuning discussion.
