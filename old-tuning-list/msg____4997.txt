Could you explain how this is derived? Did you also include absolute-error 
versions of my optimizations in your list? Is this one?

Ok, let's assume the intonation of the 6/5 is as important as that of 3/2 
and 5/4. They are not independent intervals. So what? Yes, optimizing on 3/2 
and 5/4 guarantees a pretty good 5/3. But optimizing on 3/2 and 6/5 
guarantees a pretty good 5/4. However, these optimizations lead to different 
tunings, neither of which is as optimal (under our assumption) as using all 
three. Who cares about independence?

John, under your optimization, the tuning of 6/5 (cents(3/2)-cents(5/4)) is 
as important as that of 15/8 (cents(3/2)+cents(5/4)). I would argue that the 
tuning of the 15/8 is unimportant, while the tuning of the 6/5 is very 
important. At the very least, 6/5 should be included in the optimization 
with a smaller weight than 3/2 and 5/4, but I prefer to give it full weight.

This is what made it possible to make this a one-dimensional minimization 
problem. But again, who cares about degrees of freedom? This is not 
statistical inference here!

It sure is relevant! See below.

True, but the original objective ("consonance") function is expressed 
independently of these relations. In the space of meantone tunings, these 
relations can be used to make the problem into a one-dimensional problem. 
But in general, it can only be reduced to a two-dimensional problem, since, 
as you point out, there are two independent intervals (any two can be chosen 
without affecting the result.) For example, would you not agree that just 
intonation gives better triads than any meantone tuning?
