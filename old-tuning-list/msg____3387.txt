Subject: 1/4-tone saxophone music

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Here's a CD with two quarter-tone works on it:

Vintage of European Saxophone Music. Volume 1 / The Netherlands.
Hans de Jong, saxophone and Paul Hermsen, piano.
Sound-Products Holland b.v., Fidelio 8849.

These two pieces are from Hans de Jong: "Le re^ve et la folie" and
from Kees van Unen: "...and the world doesn't own me...", both
for sax solo. The score editions are resp. Cassa Nova, Antwerpen and 
Donemus, Amsterdam.
De Jong's piece is one of extremes, of pitch, dynamics, radical
fingering and lip techniques. Van Unen's is a three-part work which
features overtone constellations, melodic playing and quarter-tone
passages.
Other composers on the CD are Lex van Delden, Joop Voorn, Jan van Dijk,
Henk Badings, with a very nice romantic composition, and Chiel
Meijering, with frivolous title as usual.
The CD is in a series of seven, but I don't know which are the other
countries.

I bought my copy at "van Leest" for the little sum of f9,95. So hurry!
