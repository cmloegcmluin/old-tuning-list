Subject: forum CD update

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Closer and closer...the final DAT and graphics are now ready to go to 
the manufacturer...if all goes well, I'll have the CD's the 2nd week of 
September, and will be ready to ship them out. To those of you who posted 
me wanting to proofread the liners, my apologies, but I believe that you 
will be pleased with the final results...it looks real sharp. I am not 
sure yet of the final costs, but will know soon...the artwork and dat 
transfers were done at minimal cost, so we're in pretty good shape...post 
me with any questions. I've been listening to a cassette version of the 
CD, and we have a unique project here, one which I believe will really 
impress a lot of folks...good job from all involved...Hstick  PS 
congratulations to Stephen James Taylor for his music credits in the new 
movie "Why Do Fools Fall In Love"...I saw an ad for it on TV the other 
nite, and said "Hey, I know that guy"...
