Well, it's finally moving...I went to the studio Friday, and put 5 
tracks onto the master DAT...only problem is, Warren Burt's dat is toast, 
and we need another..I've posted him, if anyone knows a quick way to get 
ahold of him, please do so...I need his dat to move on. Also, as a note, 
the final product will reflect exactly what each person sent me...all 
fades, noise, or whatever, will be just like the dats I received...see 
you...Hstick
