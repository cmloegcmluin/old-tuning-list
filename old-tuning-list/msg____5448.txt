Hello, Graham,

Thanks for joining the fray!  This is good stuff.  Great sense of humor, too!

Huh?  I'm not sure Marion literally meant transcendental numbers; I took it
to be a bit of tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  In any event, it seems evident
to me that the math of roots and exponents is more complex than that of
whole-number ratios.  If you can solve for the nth root of x in your head,
and multiply it by the factor of the previous note of the scale in your head,
you really do have some mathematical skills to show off!  And if I'm not
mistaken, that math is necessary for ETs whether or not you're trying to
approximate a JI tuning.

This sounds like interesting analysis but I'm not sure what it means.  Do you
mean that the larger the number of equal divisions of a given interval, the
more musically useful the resulting scale?  If so, why?  If not, how small is
small?  And why should a scale played in order be boring?  "Joy to the world"
by G. F. Handel is a good example of musically interesting and effective use
of scale tones in their "natural" order.  I must be missing your point.

This makes logical sense.  It is true that human perception of audio
phenomena, pitch included, is essentially logarithmic.  But why does it make
musical sense to simply quantize this logarithmic space?  I'm not saying it
doesn't.  But I don't yet know of any reason that it should, either
theoretically or experientially.

I do. :-) Sort of.  At least at this point I suspect that they are.  Part of
my purpose in lighting this fire was to learn what relationships exist, if
any, between ET tunings, musical acoustics, and psychoacoustics.  Some seem
to be beginning to emerge on the list, in bits and pieces, and I'm compiling
and summarizing them as we go.  I'll probably post my summary soon.

If you haven't yet seen Ray Tomes' web site on Cycles in the Universe and
Harmonics Theory - http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm - it
explains much better than I could what I mean by "natural."  The whole cosmos
apparently can be explained (scientifically, that is, not philosophically) in
terms of harmonic overtones, and might even be thought of as a giant
vibrating string.  This is traditional science, not metaphysics.  Talk about
the music of the spheres!  The Big Twang.  I like his idea of AE0 Hz being
quite literally "in tune with the earth," and the idea of "tuning" tempi to
musical keys.

And finally,

That's only if you can get some semblance of agreement on what the term "pun"
means!  :-D  Good luck!
