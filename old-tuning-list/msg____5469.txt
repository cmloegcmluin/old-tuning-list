Whoa!  Perhaps it's time to remind folks that Western music, at least before 
the 20th century, is not - repeat NOT - based on 12TET!  (I'm not singling 
out Greg here - I've seen quite a few posts recently reflecting this 
assumption.)  It is based on the diatonic scale and the concept of tonality 
without a great deal of concern for the particular tuning used.  When the 
church modes were invented, the scale was tuned in Pythagorean tuning (3-
limit JI), with only eight notes per octave: C, D, E, F, G, A, Bb, and B.  
(Come to think of it, the Bb might be even later than that.)  Centuries 
later, 5-limit tuning was used, to make the thirds pure (at the expense of 
the D-A fifth, among other things) and more "fictitious" notes were accepted 
as sharps and flats.  By the time mean-tone came into use, the church modes 
were being replaced by hexachords and major/minor scales and there were more 
than 12 pitches per octave in use.  Well-temperaments reduced that number to 
12 only in the 18th century.  So the modes have almost *always* been used in 
JI, and *never* in 12TET!
