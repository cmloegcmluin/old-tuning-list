    Well, Ok, I am Ed Foote, I have been tuning pianos for the last 20 years
in Nashville recording studios,  ( according to some on this list, I have
been whorishly pandering to mindless musical convention), but it feeds my
family and allows me to pursue autonomous directions.  
    One of these directions is the re-acceptance of non ET tunings,  and I
have found myself drawn to the keyboard music of the 18th and 19th century.  
To that end, I have been involved in the use  of the well temperaments
promoted between Werckmiester and Young, (Thomas, not Lamonte).  Presently,
there is one country studio here that is using a well temperment on their
Steinway.  The musicians love it as long as the key signature stays below A.
These boys might not know how to define consonance three different ways, but
they know it when they hear it!. 
    I will begin teaching a course at Vanderbilt this spring, titled
"Intonation, Keyboards, and Temperament.  It will attempt to give the
students a perspective from which to regard todays 12TET as just another
arrangement, rather than a perfected ideal.   Microtonality is not enjoying
the student pursuit here that Beethoven and Mozart are, so the temperament
thread I will be pursuing is more historical than experimental.  
    Musical performance on my part is limited these days to the surreal
harmonic experience of playing hurdy-gurdy, tuned in 1/4 comma meantone, on
sessions ranging from psuedo celtic stuff for Garth Brooks, to some heavily
VSO'ed alternative tracks with Jill Sobule.  I will get a grip on this one
day, but for the nonce, this tuning forum is a continuing educational
experience for me.  Thanks to all that contribute, I would never have found
this information elsewhere. 

regards, 
Ed Foote
