Subject: Brian vs. Fourier

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

I agree that Brian's polemic against Fourier analysis methods 
went a bit overboard. A proper Fourier transform uses complex 
numbers - an imaginary sine is an exponential i.e. a 
transient. When the inherent (thermal) noise due to the finite 
number of air molecules that can impinge on an ear drum are 
taken into account, a finite transform can indeed recreate its 
effective motion from an information perspective. And, our 
sound detection system consists of some 3000 sensors, each 
with a bandwidth limit in the region of a kilohertz and a 
collective bandwidth of a maximum of 50 kHz - again very 
finite.
His basic point is correct though - a Fourier transform only 
permits an alternative view of the input to the ear system, it 
isn't the ear itself. I've always assumed that the cilial 
gross bandwidth of 3 MHz is the real upper limit to what our 
ears can figure out.
