for several years.>>

Quoting myself from  TUNING Digest 1386
<<These synthesizers have a number of advantages.  They both cost less than
$500...>>

The Kyma system hardly falls into that category.

In the near future, inexpensive software synths based on mainstream
processors and operating systems will challenge the "ease and power" of this
Rolls Royce of synthesizers.  Whether they have microtonal capabilities
sooner rather than later is something we can influence by making our wishes
known.

I expect that synthesizing ease and power go the way that computing ease and
power have gone and are going.
