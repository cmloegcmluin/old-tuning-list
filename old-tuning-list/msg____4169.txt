No, receiving government funding does not prohibit other sources of
income for non-profit organisations.

Whether STEIM gives a damn may be unclear, but Brian seems very
optimistic about the market size for Harold's Clavette. 
The matter is that the Clavette is based on the Sensorlab developed at
STEIM, so the Royal Conservatory wouldn't just be able to put it on
the market on its own, or grant Harold the rights even if it wished so. 
Then STEIM has made it clear about a year ago that this foundation
doesn't have the financial means to make any products ripe for the
market. The Sensorlab would need to be enhanced, it cannot measure
velocity at the moment, the software needs improvement, and the
original developer has left a long time ago. Working with the
Sensorlab in its current form is therefore only feasible for people
doing a project at STEIM. So it would just mean an investment that
can't be done. Expecting that STEIM gives away its rights to Harold is
not feasible I suppose. 
Anyway these are the reasons as I understand them. There must be
better technical solutions possible. Harold and anyone else who looks
for them deserves encouragement.
