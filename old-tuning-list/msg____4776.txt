Subject: Radio progress (better late than never....)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (Gregory Taylor)

A recent illness and death in the family combined
with a promotion at work has pretty much ruined my
ability to keep up with anything. Sadly, that also
has included doing nothing more than skimming the TD.
I think that common courtesy demands that I rectify
the situation, if only a little.

The second of the !12tET specials came off without
a hitch, thanks in no small measure to the contributions
of TD listpersons. In fact, I had such a heartening
response that I decided that I'd parse things out over
several programs so that everyone featured got 10-15
minutes. This means that some of you are here, and some
of you are in what now appear to be the *next* two shows.
As it stands, special #3 will run toward the end of this
month (just before the spring fundraiser, as a matter of
fact), and #4 about a month later; if you don't see your
name on *this* list, don't panic - I'm trying to space
the contributors out so that I'm not "ghettoizing" the
folks who don't release "commercial" product (it's quite
hard to tell, in fact).

You can find an online version of this program on the
web site for my program at

For those of you who were featured, I really meant to
send you electronic tearsheets before now. I apologize
for the delays - there are simply times when life its
ownself intervenes.

With regards,
Gregory

P.S. TD1K - cool!

!12tET Part 2 - Beyond 12 tone Equal Temperament in the Present Age

Having paid proper homage back in December to the trailblazers in our
midst, we start to look at the music of those composers who look beyond
the usual 12 notes in the usual "twelfth root of two" location in the
present day. Since the line continues for some distance, we'll pick up
with another batch of works by younger composers next month.
