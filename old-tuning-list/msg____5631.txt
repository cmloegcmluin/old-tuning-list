Haverstick's comments are deeply personal and should be respected as such.
My own tastes in music are probably very different from his, but the
variety of musical experience is one aspect of the intrinsic interest in
music. Sometimes I hit very heavy boundaries - pieces of music or
repertoires that simply don't work for me; some music that others treasure
is simply not usable as music for me.

And that reminds me of Gordon Mumma's culinary example: there are some
things that other people or peoples use for food that I am unable, be it
through biology or aculturation, to use for food myself. (Hostess
Snowballs, asefaetida, and bitter melon top my personal list of not-foods,
while lots of folks probably would be dismayed on what they might find inmy kitchen cabinets).

The challenge of becoming anthropologically aware is not to learn to use
what we taste or hear as non-foods or non-musics as foods or music, but
simply to appreciate and respect the diversity of tastes present within our
single species. (The previous discussion of neanderthal woodwinds had
aspects of a curious but charming variation on this theme).
