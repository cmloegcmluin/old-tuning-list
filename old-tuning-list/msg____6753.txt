I had been following Gregg Gibson's advocacy of 19TET with some interest,
and then I read this by Kris Peck:

You know, I gotta agree here.  One of the things I found so attractive in
Partch's music is his use of melodic intervals that are smaller than
Gibson's "melodic limen".

I'm reminded of a particular moment of enlightenment during my formative
years as a steel guitarist.  I was listening to Jerry Byrd, the master of
the Hawaiian steel guitar.  The chord progression was moving from IV to II,
and Byrd was sustaining the sixth note of the scale.  As the chord changed,
he slid the note from its position as the 3rd of IV to the 5th of II.  I
suddenly realized that these were two different notes, and my life has not
been the same since.

Does this make me an "alien"?  I don't think so.  I think that the
difference between those two notes is obvious to most people if you point
them to it.  They are only the same note when you force them into ET boxes.
