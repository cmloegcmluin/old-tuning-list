Subject: Tape Swap and the Library of Congress

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

Tape Swap Gang-

Some good news for all of us in the Swap-

Yesterday, Steve Soderberg, a librarian at the Library of Congress,
offered to archive the TD Tape Swap tape for us at LC. This is good news as he
will be archiving it properly using "Microtone" as a subject heading which
will make it easy to find using an obvious search term. It's also good because
it offically documents our group and ties us all together as a group.

Now, if there is a Tape Swap contributer that DOES NOT want their piece to go
on the Copy for the Library of Congress please e-mail me and tell me so. I
will make a specially edited copy for LC's purposes. Also, since this is being
archived in an important place I am going to have that copy burned on 2 CD's.
And since 2 CD's have more room on it than one 90 minute tape I will not have
to edit material given to me!

In any case, Neil Haverstick has sent me a tape so he's definitely on now and
yes, back from the dead, Brian McLaren graciously sent me 12 tapes full of
different composers writing between the cracks along with Brian's submissions
for the tape.
