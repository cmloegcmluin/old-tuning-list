Simply, that while there are widely divergent types of major and minor
thirds in different systems, they move proportionately in opposite
directions per specific system.  Their midpoint is the same nonetheless.

The temperament of the perfect 3/2 fifth is the least of any interval to
be tempered, except perhaps the identity intervals (of unison and octave).
Its logarithmic middle is realtively stable and therefore recognizeable in
many different tunings.

p.s.  I'm  off for Amsterdam now with 4 other musicians, and then to
Wolfenbuttal, Germany with 8 musicians (and where we'll do Carrillo's
Cristobal a Colon).  Of course, I'm excited to hear my new quartet
"Trespass," and to meet all my Dutch friends.
