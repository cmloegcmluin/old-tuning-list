Actually, it was Adam B. Silverman who contributed
that definition. Are you reading the list? A number
of definitions have been contributed by myself and
others in the last 2-3 weeks. I know you saw my Backus 
quote, because you responded to it, yet you asked for 
definitions again.

Are you sure that the ghosttone positions line
up exactly with the fret positions, and aren't
slightly displaced in some places? 

Giving the frequencies of fretted notes doesn't 
specify the frequencies of the ghosttones you 
get when you touch the string directly above or 
near those frets.

Please just give me a simple list of the ghosttones 
in your proposed series, with their frequencies and 
string positions, and don't include string positions 
which have no ghosttones--they just clutter the list.

The best way to notate the string positions would 
probably be as a percentage of string length, since 
this can be translated to any string, and easily 
compared to other models of where vibrational
nodes are found.

That was your text, so you should know.

Saying "usually related to..." is not a sufficient
specification.

How is it that you don't already know the pitches of 
the ghosttone sequence for which you claim to have a 
better model?

So the other frets which produce B's don't represent 
ghosttone positions?

Where does an octave fit into a sequence of fourths
and fifths? As you know, no number of fourths and
fifths will produce an octave (except in equal 
temperaments).

Same problem; octaves never occur in a sequence of
fourths and fifths. Please explain this contradiction.

Have you measured the frequencies of the open string
and this ghosttone using a tuner to see if their
interval ratio is indeed 2.988824? This would be an 
obvious first test of your model.
