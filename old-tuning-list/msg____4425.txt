Subject: just steel guitar, Shockwave and Justonics

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Over the years I have played with several pedal steel guitar 
players, and some of them, notably Chuck Lettes and Daniel Jones tuned 
their steels to "pure" intervals. In conversation with Daniel Jones it 
became apparent that he knew technically what he was doing--tuning pairs 
and trios of strings for beatlessness, and tuning the pedals and levers 
appropriately. Does anyone here know of any articles on non 12tet pedal 
steel guitar tunings, or recordings of "just" pedal steel?
	On another subject, I have downloaded Shockwave digital audio streaming
software, (allows "high fidelity" real time audio transmission over the 
web, and the player's free) 

http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/

and I am pretty happy with the sound (the best sounding audio streaming I 
have heard so far), although the streaming is intermittant (maybe I 
haven't adjusted everything properly yet). I think this technology might 
be useful as a tool to get the sounds of microtonal music out to the 
public. Has anyone used the shockwave audio encoder? Any opinions?

	Also, I e-mailed Justonics twice regarding price and availability 
of their just intonation software and received no response. Does anyone 
here have any updates on what these folks are doing? Is the software 
available at all yet?
