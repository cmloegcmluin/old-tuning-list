(If I sent out something different to any of you previously, this updates it.  
Sorry.)


This has been uploaded but I doubt that it will become available before 
midnight UK time tonight - so I haven't seen or tested it yet.  (It may be later, 
because the DNS apparently only gets updated on weekdays - and Monday is 
a bank Holiday in the UK - so I hope it isn't Tuesday...). The complete 
discussion paper has been uploaded, containing a total of about 12 files, which 
is zipped to one file of 1.2 Mb, and extracts to about 6 Mb.  The files are in 
Word 7 and Excel 5 for PC.


One or two of you have made suggestions about making this available in 
alternative formats etc.  Being no expert on this I'm very grateful for your 
suggestions - and will investigate asap.  Any further thoughts gratefully 
recieved - on or off list - as with everything else.  


Apologies to anyone on this list I haven't managed to respond to yet - getting a 
lot of positive response at the moment...  This will be a busy weekend - but I'll 
get back to you...
