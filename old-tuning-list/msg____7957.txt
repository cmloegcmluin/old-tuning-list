The FB-01 has no tuning tables.  All microtuning must be done on the 
fly by replacing note-on & note-off messages with sysex messages 
indicating the exact pitch to be played.  This is very flexible, but 
of course requires some software.  The tuning resolution is only 64 
steps/semitone.  The manual isn't too bad in describing how the 
microtuning works. A long time ago I wrote some awful QuickBasic 
code to do some of this. I suppose MAX or something similar could be 
used on the Mac.  I once saw Martin Bartlett demonstrating 
microtuning on the FB-01 with some Atari software, but I suspect that 
was homebrew.
In terms of sound programming, the FB-01 has only 4 sinewave 
operators. The TX-81Z has other waveforms as well.
