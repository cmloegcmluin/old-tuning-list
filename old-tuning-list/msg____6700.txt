By such reasoning one could argue that 15:8 is consonant, because 48:25
is even rougher. Your argument is therefore evidently invalid.

English words such as 'incommensurable' admit of several senses.

Your definition of the syntonic comma is one definition, but it is
irrelevant to a discussion of precisely how the consonant cycles are to
be reconciled in an equal temperament.

Your assertion that you have never denied 22-tone equal to be unfit for
diatonicism comes strangely from someone who has proclaimed this system
the salvation of music, but perhaps you mean to preserve 12-tone equal
for diatonicism. I have heard this sort of thing before - it always
reduces to "something special for ME" and 12-tone equal for everybody
else.
