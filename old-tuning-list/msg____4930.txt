From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Eratosthenes: The simplest explanation of E's enharmonic and chromatic
tunings is that he took an open string of 120 parts and subtracted 
Aristoxenos's parts in order. For the enharmonic, this procedure results 
in 120 117 114 90 and 114/90 is 19/15. In the case of the chromatic,
120 114 108 90, and  108/90 is 6/5. His diatonic is the old Sumero-
Babylonian "Pythagorean" tuning.

I think E chose 120 for the open string because astronomers were 
used to using base-60 notation (actually a form of decimally-coded 
sexagesimal). Ptolemy's string lengths are all in base-60 as it would 
have been the most familiar notation for expressing fractions,
which are cumbersome in the Greek and Roman numeral systems. 

As for computing Aristo's parts as 30th roots of 4/3, I agree that
it would be difficult to extract the 5th root of 4/3 and I think
you may have the solution to why no known Greek theorist recorded
A's genera in ET. Still, use might have been made of the Mesolabium, 
an instrument invented by Eratosthenes himself (Heath) (or Archimedes,
elsewhere) for just this type of problem. After the 5th roots were
approximated, it would have been relatively easy to compute the square 
and cube roots of the segments.

Barbera also thinks that Aristoxenos meant 4/3 for the tetrachord 
span and listed the roots for Aristo's main genera. However, if one 
simply tries to approximate the divisions, it is possible to do so 
with just square roots. The enharmonic may be described as two
successive intervals of the square root of 256/243 followed by a ditone
of 81/64 and the Intense chromatic as two square roots of 9/8 and 32/27.

One further thought, I am inclined to agree with you about Ptolemy
having observed 1:2 divisions in practice. His enharmonic still looks
artificial to me, mostly because the enharmonic was supposed to be
extinct in practice by his time. I suspect it was supplied by analogy
with the Soft Chromatic, which greatly resembles Archytas's chromatic, 
and the Soft Diatonic and Intense Chromatic, both of which may be 
descended from Aristoxenos's Soft Diatonic (100 150 250 cents) versus 
22/21 x 12/11 x 7/6 (81 151 267) and 21/20 x 10/9 x 8/7 (85 182 231).
(I believe Winnington-Ingram had similar thoughts, but I don't have
his paper on Aristoxenos and musical intervals at hand). In 500 years
musical taste could have changed sufficiently that the 1:2 pyknon was
to be prefered in the non-diatonic genera (the stereotype soft diatonic
is just on the border between Chromatic and diatonic and sounds chromatic 
to me most of the time).

Polychronios: Thanks for the source of the 68-tet division formerly
used in the Greek Orthodox liturgical music. I hadn't heard of
Archbishop Chrysanthos before.
