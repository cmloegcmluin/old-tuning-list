Subject: A Synthesizer for Neo-Byzantine Chant

From: UPB_MONIODIS@emuvax.emich.edu

If I may impose on the good graces of the List with a request for some 
direction with regard to purchasing a non-tempered synthesizer for playing 
the neo-Byzantine scales.

First, let confess that I only dabble in musical tunings; I've read some of 
the beginners materials and subscribe to 1/1, but this is not an area I've 
had occasion to pursue deeply.

Now to my question:

In the neo-Byzantine musical scores it is necessary to change tunings as one 
progress from one hymn to the next.  And, it is sometimes necessary to 
modulate tunings within a hymn.  One would, therefore, like an instrument 
where tunings can be stored and easily be evoked.  It would also be necessary 
to record a given melody in memory.

A minimum of 6 different tunings are needed for the majority of the 
compositions, though a few additional tunings are necessary for some of the 
more unusual pieces.  Usually only two voices (rarely three) are used, so   
extended polyphonic ability is not needed.

I'd gladly respond to any additional question needed to help in identifying 
a synthesizer(s) which would meet these requirements.
