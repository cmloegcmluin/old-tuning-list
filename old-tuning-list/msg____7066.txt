Just trying to stay clear of that "what-interval-is" consonance
debate...

Seriously though, 1 cent resolution would be the correct term.

Sheesh! I didn't want to start a panic. But I guess I did anyway...
it would probably be ok to stick email links in there so
if a web surfer had a question, they could direct it to
the right person. Just an email address, no names.

It showed up last night, now all I have to do is decide what the final

That's it. He doesn't look at his email everyday. He's a pretty
busy guy. He's even on the list but he's too busy to take part.

Sample it. Slow it down or time shift it or what ever those
sampling folks do.                 ;-)

Jon's fretless is one of his interchangeable fretboards.
I'm 99% sure it's stainless steel. Mine has a maple
neck & fingerboard. Originally of the three that he ordered from
G&L, I thought that only mine was maple and the others were
going to be setup with steel fretboards. Now I find out that
Jon's going to use one of them as a dedicated JI guitar.
I know he was talking to the G&L reps about stainless steel
fretboards but I don't know what came of it. And there's
a NYC musican who visited the
store who wanted the third one but hasn't been heard from since.
Anybody interested? It at least needs a nut to be fretless.
The nut didn't get cut because the jig at G&L that cuts
the fret slots also cuts the nut. [the same originally built
by Leo Fender - he's the L in G&L. Fender corp. or inc. had
a long - at least 1 year - delivery time and expensive too.
Can you say Custom Shop?]

Last friday we met with the luthier who's probably going
to do the fretwork and the subject of fretless came up.
He's done some fretless necks out on Long Island and he
isn't into the stainless steel fretboard. All the ones
he's done, he uses some kind of urathane (spelling?)
finish. He claims that it strengthens and reinforces the
neck. I don't know if this changes JC's plans.

JC has been mentioning the latest Pat Metheny "Imaginary Day"
because the first track features a fretless classical guitar.
So I picked it up last week and it's a trip. PM's a guy who's
known for sliding around a bit anyway. The album is named
after the lead track and is while I've always dug his playing,
Lyle Mays (the keyboard player) uses some synths that almost
seem glitzy. Then the composition takes a left turn that makes one
forget about any glitz.

With all due respect, I first heard about this track right here in
Tuning Digest from Neil Haverstick. Thanks for the tip Neil!
Didn't I write about how much I like the new CD?
