That's impossible to answer without defining more specifically what
context you're talking about.  With a good rich timbre, clear harmonic
context, and sustained tones, surprisingly many people can hear
differences of down to a cent or even less because of beat rates.  OTOH,
with a timbre with few strong partials, fast tempi, and/or an isolated
melody (or a sufficiently complex harmonic context), even fairly large
commas can pass unnoticed.
