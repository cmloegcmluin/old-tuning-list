Subject: An easy introduction to tuning

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Common in music pedagogy is pentatonic improvisation, as on the black keys 
of a piano. I find that the choice of Pythagorean vs. Zarlinan (meantone) 
tuning for the pentatonic scale has a profound effect on the result. I first 
experienced this using an organ timbre and the two sounded so different that 
I was convinced that the timbre, not the tuning, was being changed (I was 
wrong). There is no way to decide which sounds better for a random 
pentatonic improvisation, but the difference is striking, and the difference 
in the resulting compositional choices is likely to prove striking as well. 
Therefore I think this might just be the best way to introduce newcomers to 
the issues of tuning.
