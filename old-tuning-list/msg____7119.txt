Subject: RE: !@#$%^&* to Dan Wolf

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

This message I posted on December 5 was not only insulting to Mr. Wolf,
but ended up insulting him behind his back, as he already signed off the
list. Daniel brought a great deal of knowledge and experience to the
discussions here, and I felt that it would be a great loss to have him
sign off. I felt insulted on behalf of the list subscribers, especially
the newer ones, as I interpreted Daniel's comments to indicate that he
had nothing more to learn and it was not worth his while to teach.
Another interpretation is possible, however; Daniel may simply have been
too busy to keep up with the influx of new subscribers and (often) old
topics and needed to focus more time on real life for a while. With
insulting brats like myself around having no lives ourselves, who could
blame him?

My sincerest apologies to Daniel Wolf and here's hoping he returns to
the fold soon.
