I hope Sekar Jaya didn't use the verb "bang" when describing what one does
with a Gamelan instrument.  We always had to watch people like a hawk to
make sure that they played the gong with the right end of the mallet to keep
it from being damaged for instance.  Gamelans lend themselves much better to
playing by inexperienced music makers than do Partch's instruments- we still
had to be careful and respectful of them.

I do tend to put Partch in his own category- I can't think of a single other
composer that built his own instruments, developed his own theory of music
(albiet from many pre-existing sources) and then wrote a body of fascinating
and compelling music using these instruments.  Unfortunately my only
exposure to his music is through records.  I still remember Skip LaPlante's
performance with his Kithara copy at an AFMM concert of a Partch piece a
couple of years ago- it's the closest thing to a performance I've seen.
