Haverstick briefly here...first of all, Gary Morrison said in his last
post (digest 913, I believe) that Elaine Walker (Mullen) had dropped off
the forum because much of it's content was not related, necessarily, to
MUSIC, per se, but to theories of same...this correlates nicely with my
comments about microdoodling, I feel...more killer sounds are in order.
Also, I must say, although I have always gotten along well with McLaren,
and he has sent me much great stuff over the years, and I have no
personal beef with him, I must say that it is getting out of hand with
the personal attacks and all the time spent responding to them...I do
not enjoy wading through a lot of personal flack on this forum...my time
is precious to me, and I am here to learn and share...Brian, man, you
know I have a lot of respect for you, and think you have a great
mind...if there are personal things driving you to seem so mean at
times, it's best to get to the root of them, and drive them from your
soul...I myself spent time in therapy some years ago, and it was a very
healing thing to do...your personal life is none of my business, to be
sure, but I think you need to check yourself out, and deal with whatever
is haunting you...there is no shame in that. Anyway, Brian, your
insights at times are greatly appreciated, and I have learned a lot from
you, and hope to do so in the future...this is no place, however, for
personal attacks on others...Hstick
