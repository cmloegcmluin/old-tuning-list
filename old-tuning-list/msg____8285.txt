   The relationships between timbre and tuning are exactly the topic of Bill
Sethares' recently-published (by Springer) book/demo CD, "Tuning Timbre Spectrum
Scale".  Interesting book.

   It would not be difficult to imagine that a timbre like a clarinet's, having
weak even harmonics, would be more "picky" about the precision of a 5:3 major
sixth than of, say, a 3:2 octave.  That since it has strong 5th and 3rd harmonics
that could beat against each other if not tuned precisely, whereas its second
harmonic could be weak enough to not be as picky about that.
