Subject: Helmholtz's book

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

As far as I know, the edition of Helmholtz's book
"On the Sensations of Tone" which is ordinarily
available these days (at least it's the one I have)
is put out by Dover.
 
>From the copyright page:
> "This Dover edition, first published in 1954,
> is an unabridged and unaltered republication
> of the second (1885) edition of the Ellis translation
> of  _Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen_..."

There are extensive appendices by Ellis,
and these are invaluable in themselves as
tabulations of historical intonations.

This book was the catalyst which started
Partch on his way to his future development
as a just-intonation composer, theorist and
instrument-builder.  From Partch's  "Genesis
of a Music", 2nd edition, p. vii:

> "In 1919, as I recall, I had virtually given up on
> both music schools and private teachers, and
> had begun to ransack public libraries, doing
> suggested exercises and writing music free
> from the infantilisms and inanities of professors
> as I had experienced them.

> of Tone_.  Under this new impetus, doubts
> and ideas achieved some small resolution,
> and I began to take wing."

It influenced many other harmonically
inventive composers in a similar fashion
 -- I believe among these were Debussy and
Ben Johnston.  It's well worth the cost.

By the way, the full title of the book is "On the
Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis
for the Theory of Music", and most of it is
an explanation of Helmholtz's scientific
experiments on sounds and hearing, and
their results.   Notice the emphasis this places
on the subject (the listener) -- reminiscent of
my quoting Meyer the other day about music
theory having to do not only with acoustics
but also with nervous tissue.

A very interesting book about the history of
tonality in European music, which emphasizes
a subjective interpretation of tonal concepts,
is _Tonality in Western Culture: A Critical and
Historical Perspective_  by Richard Norton
[Pennsylvania State University Press, 1984].
