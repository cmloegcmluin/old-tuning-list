Bruce, I don't think you're missing anything, you're exactly right. If our 
brains are built to recognize harmonic series, it doesn't matter if the 
fundamental or some octave-equivalent is present or not. For example, given 
a set of pure tones forming a harmonic series but with the fundamental 
missing, say, 300, 500, 600, and 700 Hz, what we hear is a single pitch at 
100Hz. This is called fundamental tracking, and has nothing to do with 
difference tones. Other psychoacoustical examples that would prove you 
right, Bruce, are nonlinearities and partials forming critical band 
roughness. In these cases, assuming you have instruments with reasonably 
harmonic partials, you get the smoothest effects with intervals from 
anywhere in the (lower) harmonic series, whether the fundamental is 
represented or not. But the harmonic series remains a fine way of 
understanding these phenomena.

The only case where fundamentals might take on special importance in
applying the harmonic series to music is when trying to put a chord in
"root position." It helps the stability of a chord if the fundamental
or octave equivalent thereof is in the bass part. This explains why,
in the days when minor triads were very close to 10:12:15, pieces in
minor keys tended to end on a mjor triad, 4:5:6, for stability.
However, once minor triads began to be tuned close to 16:19:24 (as in
equal temperament), the root of the became was an octave-equivalent of
the fundamental, so it was okay to end a piece on a root-position
minor triad.
