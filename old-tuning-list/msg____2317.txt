Subject: Re: How common was the quasi-pythagorean `intonation'

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I'd be willing to bet that the ancient Greeks knew well of the similarity
between the syntonic and pythagorean commas, because I know that they were well
aware of the syntonic comma.  But I don't know for certain that they used that
chord structure.  

   By the way, Bill Wesley (from the San Diego vicinity) has built ... three I
think ... instruments that use this principle profusely.  They could perhaps be
described as "megakalimbas" in that they use metal tynes on a wood soundboard.
Form a quick look about two years ago, I would guess that they had about 150
tynes or so.
