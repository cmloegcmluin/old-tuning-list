Subject: 19 marches on

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick here...one of my 16 year old students just had a 19 tone
guitar built...this young man is very talented and intelligent, and came
to Microstock '95 and sat in the front row from start to
finish...nothing could encourage me more than this, that a younger
generation of musicians is getting interested in non 12 tunings...who
knows what this kid might do? Hopefully, he will do something that the
rest of us have not thought of, and hopefully it will be profound and
meaningful...Hstick
