Whoops, I almost missed this one.

That was my family, not yours, in that shtetl. If you want to put words in 
my mouth, like "hilariously amusing" and "lighten up," please restrict it to 
musical topics. Anyway, the point is that Mr. Taylor clearly did not accuse 
you of being anti-semitic, despite your pleas to the contrary.

Apparently, barbershop singers use 7/5 all the time. See if you can get them 
to sing neutral thirds in front of an audience. Anyone care to back me up? 
Neutral thirds are very pungent harmonies.

As for 22-tET vs. 19-tET, isn't it possible to feel that they are very 
different but to like both for the unique characteristics that each might 
have? You can't really make a direct comparison that covers all potential 
uses. I may have said - not "decried" - that 22 sounds "slimy" when used for 
diatonic progressions such as I-IV-II-V-I in a major key; this is because 
the second scale degree must adjust by a hugely inflated syntonic comma of 
55 cents. Blackwood's 22-tone etude continues to strike me as ugly, while I 
love his 19-tone etude. Nontheless, I must "like" 22, since I have, and will 
continue to, exert the vast majority of my microtonal energy to exploring 
22-tET. Randy Winchester's music demonstrates some other effective 
approaches to 22-tET.
