   As another aside, that depends quite a bit on which instrument you're
talking about.  In the viola chapter he added to Yehudi Menuin's violin
book, the pivotal early-1900s violist William Primrose characterized the
open strings as the treasure of the viola sound.

   I would imagine also that that is largely a violin-only thing, based
upon the time periods you mentioned.  Why?  In the classical period, the
stridency of the modern (usually) solid-steel E-string was a thing of the
future, and for the violin only.
