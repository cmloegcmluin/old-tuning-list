Thanks for your comments, Paul (E).  After four days I was beginning to
wonder if anybody gave a damn about my goofy ideas.

This is a good question, and I'm not sure if I have a good answer for
it.  Probably the best answer I can give is this: the main thrust of my
theoretical wanderings in xenharmony is to discover tunings that are
analogous to common practice harmony, in the sense that they have
similar structures according to various hypothesized perceptual models.
Common practice 5-limit harmony did not find 5TET or 7TET sufficient for
its purposes, despite the fact that they are level 1 consistent at the
5-limit; it settled on 12TET, which is level 3 consistent.  Therefore, I
tentatively conclude that there is some kind of advantage to higher
levels of consistency.

A possible explanation is this: an ET which is level 1 consistent at a
given limit may err from a just interval within that limit by up to
half a step.  It seems to me that my ear, at least, would not readily
accept such an ET as an approximation to that interval when almost any
interval randomly chosen from the continuous gamut would be more closely
approximated by that ET.  Since the average error of random intervals is
1/4 step, level 2 consistency at the N-limit ensures that N-limit
intervals will be better approximated than the average randomly chosen
interval.  Thought of in this way, one can justify choosing level 2 as a
lower limit on consistency.

Does that make any sense?
