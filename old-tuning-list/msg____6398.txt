I've been playing the Japanese koto for over 30 years and can heartily and
warmly recommend it for use in a variety of tuning systems.  It has 13
strings, made from an artificial silk, of great carrying power, is capable
of a variety of "bent" notes and graces, and can be retuned in medias res.
There is a 16 string version, and a 20 string version, and any number of
semi-custom versions.  If you get a version up in the 20+ string range you
can set it up as two instruments with different tuning systems.

The Chinese make a correlative instrument with 23-25 strings of wire which
you can tune in a variety of systems of your own devising; its name is Jeng
(pronounced "juhng").

Of course, the classical Chinese Gu Qin is bridgeless and fretless and can
be played in any interval system the artist can devise and handle.  It is a
most expressive instrument in terms of its "bent note" graces.  It uses
"artificial silk" strings.

The nice thing about these instruments is that they are all available in
modern, contemporary, pieces and therefore are affordable.

Anybody who has experience playing a harp or an Appalachian mountain
dulcimer should be capable of learning to play one or more of these
instruments.
