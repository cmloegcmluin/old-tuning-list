   Fortunately, the math involved isn't terribly complicated.  Also 3/2
(same as 3:2) doesn't really necessarily imply a G.  It does only in the
key of C.

   This harkens back to the age-old, venerable, and still pretty much
accepted, observation attributed to Pythagoras, that our ears are
exceptionally sensitive to simple ratios of vibrational frequency.  This is
the basis behind just intonation - tunings built around precise renderings
of these simple ratios, rather than approximations to them like our usual
tuning (12-Tone-per-octave Equal-Temperament, often abbreviated "12-equal",
"12TET", "12tET", or "12ET").

   The simple ratio for an octave is 2:1, meaning that the vibrational
frequency of the higher note is twice the frequency of the lower one.  The
ratio for the perfect fifth (G being a P5 above C), is 3:2.  Here are some
others:

Perfect Fourth P4 4:3
Major Third M3 5:4
Minor Third m3 6:5
Major Sixth M6 5:3
Minor Sixth m6 8:5
Major Second M2 either 9:8 or 10:9, the difference between the two being a
   "syntonic comma", or Paul R. would presumably call it a Just Syntonic Comma
   or perhaps a 5-limit Just Syntonic Comma.
Major Seventh M7 15:8

   And heading into nontraditional harmonies:
Septimal subminor third Septimal minor third 7:6
Septimal subminor seventh Septimal minor seventh 7:4
Neutral third 11:9 (11:9 is the most commonly-discussed neutral third, but
   there are others.)
And there are many many others in this comparatively unexplored realm.
