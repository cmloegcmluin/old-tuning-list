Subject: Thrice the Severity

From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com>

1. If we detune by hertz, a direct arithmatic variation in beating occurs,
right?

2. Detune in cents and you say we get a "linear" change in beating?
"Linear" and "geometric" are the same?

3. For detuning in cents sqaured...

>>>it means that our intervals get worse exponentially.
>>
>>You mean quadratically (very different!).

Could you explain the difference?
