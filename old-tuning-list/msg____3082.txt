Subject: Pandit Pran Nath

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I saw in the San Diego paper this Monday that Pandit Pran Nath died 
last Thursday in Berkeley at age 77. He was a master of the very 
microtonal Kirana tradition and greatly influenced Terry Riley and 
Lamont Young  as well as other musicians interested in just intonation 
in singing. 

In addition to performing and teaching in India, he taught at UCSD 
in 1973 and was a visiting professor of music at Mills College from 
1973 to 1984.
