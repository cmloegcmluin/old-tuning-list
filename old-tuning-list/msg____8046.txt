And what would be the correctly tuned version?

I strongly agree that augmented triads sound more dissonant in 31-equal,
or with just major thirds as in JI or meantone, than in 12-equal. Does
that argue against anything I said?

In this context, yes. The 5/4 is by far the strongest interpretation of
the 4deg12 interval, while the 9/8 and 10/9 have nearly equal claims to
the 5deg31 interval.

I was only making an analogy, not a direct comparison.

Can you flesh out exactly how you see that one implies the other? Don't
forget that the 28/25 is naturally closer to a 9/8 than a 10/9, so
tuning it to a 10/9 means you've had to distort the other intervals
more.

Well, 9/8 has that "rooted" stability since it has a power of two in the
denominator.

Come again?

Er, do you really think 28/25 is any kind of "just" interval in the
sense of being a "target" you could really aim for without tuning the
other intervals in the chord?

Anything that goes from the dominant of the dominant to the augmented
sixth chord is exploiting the vanishing of the 225/224.
