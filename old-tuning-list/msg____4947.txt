Subject: the Universe and sound

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...when Ray Tomes says the Universe is oscillating
as a giant musical instrument, that must be what the Book Of The Hopi
means when it says "The Universe quivered in tune;" what the Indians
(East) mean by the OM vibration; what the Bible means when it says
"The Word was God." I am, unfortunately, not much on math, but I do
believe it is possible to unlock some of the secrets of this Universal
instrument by intuitive means, by "ear," so to speak, by trying to
"tune in" to the absolutely zillions and zillions of vibrations that
form this rather large instrument that we live in. I'm glad other folks
are interested in this same phenomenon...Hstick
