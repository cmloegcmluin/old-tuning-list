No, 0.6% means a frequency change of 0.6%. Basically Goldstein dealt
with the way complex tone pitch (virtual pitch) was inferred from sets
of pure tones which departed by various amounts from an exact harmonic
series. His experimental results were very well fit by a model with only
one parameter, sigma, which could vary from listener to listener.
Essentially the model states that the listener will interpret the set of
pure tones as a certain virtual pitch if the pure tones have an rms
deviation less than sigma from a harmonic series above that virtual
pitch. As the deviations are increased further, the ear shifts to a
different, lower virtual pitch, whose harmonics better fit the pure
>tones (this is a very rough description).
