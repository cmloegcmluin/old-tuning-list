If you're talking about a rectangular prism cavity, it's easy; the 
resonances will have frequencies at all multiples of (two over the length of 
any edge) times the speed of sound. If you're talking about a more complex 
shape, there may not be a formula, but computer simulation is always a 
cheaper alternative these days.
