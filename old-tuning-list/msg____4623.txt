This depends on whether 9 is mapped on the 3 axis (3^2) or given an axis of
its own. There are some musical contexts (and some temperaments as well -
the tuning of the TX81Z comes to mind) where 9 _has_ a harmonic function
distinct from 3^2. Of, course, there are other musical settings -especially
long duration sound installations - where distinguishing prime identities
is more important.

Wilson has graphed his CPSes with factors of 9, 15, and 21 mapped to
independent axes. From what I recall of his notes, he has sketched out
CPSes with all combinations, including repeated factors, through 15, and
tried out a few promising sets with higher factors. The three Eikosany he
has worked with most are 3(1,3,5,7,9,11), 3(1,3,7,9,11,15), and
3(1,3,5,7,11,13) and the two Hebdomekontany are 4(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) and
4(1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19), the latter of which I have played with on my Rayna.
(It can have a Stravinskian quality due to the everpresent quasi-octotonic
scales).

Perhaps John can persuade Erv to publish his ''Letter to Adrian Fokker''
and ''Letter to John Chalmers'' where all of this material - including the
graphing that Paul describes - were first set out.
