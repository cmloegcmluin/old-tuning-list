Subject: Octaves (Paul E)

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I have great difficulty with statements about a supposed preference for
stretched octaves. Once you get out of the ''piano zones'', the evidence
starts to collapse. My recent posting on Javanese gamelan was one examplethat showed a statistically equal preference for larger, just or smaller
octaves, and my experiences with other musics are similar - when the tuner
wants the octave to beat, it doesn't matter if it is because the octaves
are smaller or larger than a 2:1.

I asked the maker of my gamelan what he thought about the ''pleng'' tuning
for the octaves I had chosen. His reply was that, in effect, I had made aconsumer choice against a particular shimmering quality caused by beatingand that singers and rebab players would have to be more careful in the
upper register because of the unisons, but that the tuning was not an
unacceptable one. He added that the tuning was more restfull, more
''Javanese'' than ''Balinese''. So, the rationale he gave for the non-just
octaves was related to timbre and difficulty in performance due to a lackof fuzziness around the pitches, to some cultural referents, and not at all
to a intervallic preference for stretching.  Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
