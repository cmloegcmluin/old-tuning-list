I had mentioned the study involving Mozart in a post last week and no one 
had responded with any comments or ideas about music and psychology. I 
don't know if this is because people on this forum are all too familiar 
with the psychological research in music or maybe just not interested.  
Perhaps the discussion belongs in a different forum.  But for anyone 
interested in and unfamiliar with it, much of the research in the field 
of music/psychology seems very relevant to the discussions on this 
forum.  Some areas of research include (found through the internet) 
cognitive organization, music perception/cognition, pitch perception, 
perception of simple combinations of notes, cognition of musical form, 
roughness of chords, musical minds/musical ears, social psycholgy and 
music, teaching/learning, training, practice, composition, sight reading, 
eye movements in sight reading, auditory representation in sight reading, 
to name a few.  There are numerous sites on the internet including the 
Society for Research in Psychology of Music and Music Education (SRPMME) 
and Music Perception.
