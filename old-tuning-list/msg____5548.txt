American Festival of Microtonal Music 
MicroMay '97 
Day #2: "Jewel" 
Columbia University's St. Paul's Chapel 
New York, N.Y. May 21, 1997

Day 2 of AFMM's MicroMay began with a transcription 
of Andrea Gabrieli's Vezzosa Filli, a piece for double 
quartet of singers. The resonant St. Paul's Chapel
(at least a couple of seconds of reverb) was an additional 
instrument, reinforcing the music with a glow. Vezzosa Filli 
was perfect for this space. 

sopranos - Meredith Borden,Piera F. Paine 
altos - Adria Quinones, Elizabeth Lee 
tenors - Brendan Glynn, Orlando Colon, 
basses - Gabriel Mendlow, Andrew Clateman 

Three pieces by John Dowland: Lachrimae, The Frog 
Galliard, and Forlorn Hope Fancy were performed by Wim 
Hoogewerf. Dowland's "personal tuning" uses
perfect ji thirds and fifths yet still contains some intervals 
that enrich and color (IMHO) the tuning. Like the Gabrieli, 
the ambient St. Paul's contributed to the
performance. 

just intonation guitar - Wim Hoogewerf 

Johnny Reinhard's Eye of Newt is another of his works 
in polymicrotonality - where more then one tuning is used. 
His technique of using more then one tuning
creates frequent unexpected changes in mood. Multiphonics 
and singing through his alto recorder adds harmony to this potion. 

alto recorder - Johnny Reinhard 

Ei, Wie der Kaffee ist Suisse by J. S. Bach for 
soprano, flute and harpsichord in Werkmeister III. A 
wonderful piece that gives the soprano a chance to 
sing about how wonderful coffee is. Unfortunately the 
chapel drank this one up, obscuring the details. 

soprano - Meredith Borden 
baroque flute - Andrew Bolotowsky 
harpsichord - Rebecca Pechefsky 

One of the most anticipated events of the festival was 
the NY premiere of the solo version of Harry Partch's 
Barstow by John Schneider. The result of historical
research, Schneider had a custom guitar built based 
on Partch's notes. Schneider released a version of 
Barstow on Just West Coast - microtonal music for guitar and
harp (Bridge) a few years ago and he's refined his approach 
since then. Now his Partchian sprechgesang is a bit more 
approprate to the piece. 

After the concert I asked Schneider about his future plans 
for microtonal guitar recordings and was told that he's 
planning to record or has unreleased recordings of
works by Partch (US Highball for guitar and voice), La Monte 
Young (a newer composer supervised slower version of 
Sarabande), more works by Lou Harrison and others including 
his own compositions. 

Partch monophonic-model guitar - John Schneider 
                                                  
Shruti is the 22 interval scale of India and also the title 
of Ganesh Anandan's contribution to the festival. He 
played his homemade percussion, metal bars resting
on foam and resonators and then sang in a gruff overtone 
style. NY premiere. 

extended voice, original instruments - Ganesh Anandan 

Andrew Culver's Architectonic Space placed the musicians 
spatially around the chapel. The trumpet in the balcony, the 
violin in the pulpit, the viola to the side near the pews and 
so on. Culver's purely minimalistic held tones disregard the
obsessive rhythmic cells favored by most minimalists, the 
primary influences seem to be John Cage and La Monte Young. 

A Tuning Digest buddy said that listening to Architectonic 
Space was like watching paint dry. I happen to like this kind 
of zen minimalism, but think that the composer
missed a great opportunity to explore the rich resources 
of higher limit just intonation systems. NY premiere. 

alto flute - Andrew Bolotowsky 
bass clarinet - Ron Kozak 
bassoon - Johnny Reinhard 
violin - Dan Auerbach 
viola - Anastasia Solberg 
cello - Jodi Beder 
trumpet - John Charles Thomas 

The Quarter tone Preludio a Colon by Julian Carrillo 
also used occasional eighth tones. It's pieces like this 
that spark up a festival like this, the tuning is so far out
that there's no doubt that it's not in the much too common 
12 tone equal temperament. Icing on the cake! 

soprano - Meredith Borden 
flute - Andrew Bolotowsky 
violins - Dan Auerbach, Tina Cho 
viola - Anastasia Solberg 
cello - Jodi Beder 
24 tone equal temperament guitar - Wim Hoogewerf 
96 tone equal temperament harp - Skip LaPlante 
conductor - Johnny Reinhard 

My picks: Barstow, Preludio A Colon and Eye of Newt. Not that there was
anything wrong with the other works. Just my personal highlights. 

Stay tuned for more...
