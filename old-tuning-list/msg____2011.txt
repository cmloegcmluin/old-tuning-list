Subject: clarinet microtones

From: "Edwin M. Richards" <76400.1435@compuserve.com>

I have just signed on to this group, after hearing that my dissertation on
clarinet microtones was mentioned.  This information (478 microtones) has been
included in a book ("The Clarinet of the Twenty-First Century") that also
describes 213 altissimo register fingerings and 463 multiple sounds - I also
have a somewhat shorter but similar book on bass clarinet.  Please send me a
private email if  you would like further information.

The German fingering system still exists (in fact many German orchestras will
not even admit a Boehm-system player to an audition), although almost all
American clarinetists use Boehm system instruments (one notable exception is
Michelle Zukovsky of the LA Philharmonic, who uses a Wurlitzer clarinet) -
multiphonics are possible, but, naturally involve different fingerings (Joji
Yuasa details multiphonic fingerings for both French/American/Boehm and German
systems in his "Clarinet Solitude") - it is not always possible to generate the
same pitches from both systems.
