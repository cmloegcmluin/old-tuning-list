Subject: Justonic Pitch Pallet >12 tones/oct

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

In a recent post about the eps 16 + and the asrx, someone mentioned
Justonic Pitch Pallette software as an example of software that supports
tuning changes in real time.  However, they added that it can only do 12
note scales.  You can work around this by using a scale change message
before any notes that are not part of the original scale of the piece.
This techinique, albeit a little cumbersome, allows you to use more than
12 tones per octave.
