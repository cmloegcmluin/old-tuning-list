Yes, but there are already contradictions. shouldn't
we iron them out before proceeding?

Of course! I will not automatically jump to your conclusions, 
just because you do. You're the one who claimed he found a 
better model for the physics of ghosttones on real strings, 
and that ghosttones follow a cycle of pi-derived fourths and 
fifths. I expect you to be able to back this up, or stop
making the claims. I have nothing against any tuning system.
I do have a problem with unfounded claims being made about
a tuning system in order to promote its use. I'm requesting 
logical exposition of those claims in expectation that 
failure to produce such exposition will discredit the claims.

The second column, approximate notes played on nearby 
frets, is irrelevant to the discussion of ghosttones.

BTW, 41 percent is probably is mismeasurement of 40, 
40 being twice the distance of 20, both positions 
being nodes which divide the string into 5 parts and 
produce a pitch near 550 Hz.

Yes, which are easily explained as falling near the 
integer multiples of A, in the series 1 2 3 4 5 6.

You said that the frequencies and volumes of ghosttones 
followed this dual series. 

The E's you found (330, 660) were in the wrong octaves
to coincide with your ascending fifths series which 
predicts E to occur in the octave between 110 and 220.

You didn't find any ghosttones which produced B or F# 
in the series of ascending fifths, let alone have them 
be louder than the C# you found. 

You found no ghosttones which produced D G C F or Bb. 
This last fact pretty much destroys the ascending-
fourths half of your proposed dual series. 

Notice that the integer-multiple series (1 2 3 4 5 6)
nicely explains your own findings without skipping 
any expected pitches. It also predicts that you will
find an additional ghosttone with an approximate 
frequency of 770 near the string percentages 14, 29, 
43, 57, 71, and 86. Let me know if you find it.

I understand bpm, but what are the beats supposed 
to be a measurement of in the first place?
