Thanks for the interest!

The instrument is the soundboard, harp and strings from an old piano, that
was on it's way to the dump from a theater I used to work for. It is mounted
on a large easel-like stand with weels to roll. It is the second hardest of
my instruments to move (only the Bass Marimba is harder). The highest
strings (to the far right) are tuned to Subharmonics 1-12, in courses of 4
seperated by a 2-string space to make it easier to hit them with marimba
mallets. The center section is tuned to harmonics 4-18, with the same
coursing and spacing. The lowest section is subharmonics 5-19, with varying
numbers of strings per course.

Besides hitting them with both hard and soft mallets (near the bridge for a
brite sound, in the center for a mellow sound) I also play it with a flat
pick, and occassionally with finger picks. Am planning to put some sounds on
the web-site pretty soon. Does anyone else want me to do that?
