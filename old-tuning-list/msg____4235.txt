Subject: Neil Haverstack's grab that AXE post.

From: Jeff Welty <jwelty@wdni.com>

Hello all,

Try not to nitpick the following stream of conciousness to much :-).

1) I think everyone is to be complemented for the ensuing dialogue after
   Neil's post.

2) There definitely should be room in the non-12TET for all types of
   appreciation, whether it be the "blues-jazz" types, or the "pop" types,
   or the "classical-intellectual" types.

3) Neil has an excellent point about music as heard by an audience though,
   if it doesn't "move" the audience emotionally, there will eventually be
   no audience.

4) I have yet to hear a non-12TET piece that "moves" me. That would change
   if I could walk into the CD store and select 1 of hundreds of CDs in
   the "non-12TET" section, or find non-12TET music intermingled in the
   12TET sections as we now have it.

The primary obstacle to #4, is that the "common folk" don't care about
harmonic ratios etc, they care only about the emotional reactions they
have to the musical sounds that reach their ears.  If xenharmonic theory
enhances the musical sounds, that will be a Good Thing.  A theory
not put into practice has only intellectual value (and therefore very
little value to the "common folk"), but once that theory is put into
practice, then the benefit for the masses is achieved.

What is needed, I think, is some critical mass of practicing musicians doing
non-12TET.  Think how much different the landscape would be for non-12TET
if just 10% of the current 12TET musicians switched over.  There'd be a
lot of new "talents".  That would improve #4 a lot.  That would, I think
in the long run help all arenas of non-12TET.  That can happen if someone
can catch the 12TET's ears.  That can happen if we play what we speak.

So, let the intellectual discussions continue, they *are* important.  But
when the mood strikes, pick up that AXE, or Keyboard, or CPU and have a go
at the end product.  Move someone.
