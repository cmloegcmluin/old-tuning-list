Subject: Re: Trombone

From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

Stuart Dempster's book, "The Modern Trombonist," doesn't discuss
tuning in much detail.  It's really about extended trombone
techniques.

Any kind of tuning on a trombone, including adaptive tuning,
would really just depend on the ear of the trombonist.  So the
place to find out about that would be to understand adaptive
tuning in relation to just intonation as a theoretical problem,
followed by just intonation ear training.

Off the top of my head, I don't know who has such a program,
but it should be genralizable for most instruments.  You can
also make your own examples on a computer, using, for example,
Csound.  I have a lot of information on this is my course
notes, http://www.cs.ust.hk/~layers/comp342/comp342.html.  (some
of the links will be hooked up later in the semester; you can
view the page source code to find the files now).

Best,
