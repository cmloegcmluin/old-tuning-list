Subject: et/ji  discussion

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Basically, although it's been said many times before, it's worth 
saying again...equal temperaments were evolved to play music that 
modulates to distant keys. The discussion about ji this or eq that is 
rather academic, I feel, with little substance at this point. I certainly 
agree that pure tunings are part of the Universal structure, and to be in 
harmony with the Universe is the most worthy goal of life...however, if 
you like music with chord changes, as I do, you gotta use some sort of 
eq...at least, as far as I know, you do. So, we sacrifice the pureness 
that comes with modal oriented music, and at what cost, I know not. But, 
I love jazz, Bach, Bartok, Debussy, and lots of other music that 
modulates...what's a feller to do? And, I do indeed love modal music as 
well, and am studying like crazy to understand the mysteries of the 
harmonic series better. Theoretically, on a fretless instrument, one 
could play absolutely every note purely, in any key...can this be done in 
reality? I don't know...to play "Donna Lee" by Charley Parker on a 
fretless axe, with every note perfectly aligned with a natural ratio, 
would be tough, indeed...perhaps possible, though.
    Rather than engage in fruitless speculation about eq versus ji (which 
for me is a non issue), or which eq is better than that one, we should 
look at different issues, such as: which tuning will bebop sound best in? 
How about bluegrass, or reggae, or Celtic folk music? Which tuning best 
expresses what the Bedouins of Arabia feel? How about a guy in Argentina, 
singing about how lonely he is...what tuning works best for him? What 
about a European (say, German) keyboard player, who hears music with 4 or 
5 voices...what tuning should he play in? What if a composer wants to 
write about the death of his wife, whom he dearly loved...which tuning 
system best expresses such feelings? 
    My point is simple...I am interested in music and composing, and I am 
concerned about how to 1. say something meaningful and profound 2. learn 
to play the shit out of my instrument, because the better my proficiency, 
the deeper my expressive powers, plus I enjoy the challenge of trying to 
"master" the guitar, which is an impossible task, but a worthy goal for 
this life. The discussion of tunings without a corresponding body of 
music to supplement it is quite boring, I'm afraid, and I increasingly 
see this forum heading in exactly that direction. In fact, I know several 
people who are losing interest in the forum for exactly this reason. Of 
course, that's neither here or there, and the minds I encounter on my 
computer are quite stimulating at times. Again, however, I find the 
amount of great music, or virtuoso players (and that is indeed a 
deceptive word, I know, but I am making a point) connected with alternate 
tunings to be quite small, as opposed to the endless theorizing about 
this or that tuning, or which one is "better". Yikes, guys...let's make 
some monster music that touches people in their hearts, that makes the 
world a better place to be, that fights injustice, that changes people's 
consciousness for the better. Use a tuning that fits your musical needs, 
that allows you to say the things you need to say. And, learn to play 
your instruments and compose on a level that's much deeper than most of 
the microdoodling that I've heard up to this point. Practice and 
study...that's what it takes. We don't need to hear someone demonstrate 
how cool a "just" scale sounds on a cheesy sounding synth; we need 
masterful compositions, with skillful playing. Are we gonna get it? I 
sure hope so. Because if we don't, the world at large is just going to 
view us as a sort of quirky, fringe group, talking about vague subjects 
that have little meaning to anyone's real life...and, that's a shame, 
because there is such potential to use other tuning systems to change 
music for the better...Hstick
