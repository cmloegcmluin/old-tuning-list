Check out our web page. Look at the instruments section. Many of our
instruments are not yet posted, but you mentioned Harmonic Flutes. We have
developed an entire family of these. they started out as the long straight
Fipple pipes, which I called "Harmonic Whistles" back in the 70's, because
they play the natural harmonic series, like a bugle. Then there are the
medium sized pipes with one hole, which allow alternation between two
adjacent series and allow for composite scales between them. Finally, there
are the custom recorders, (Alto, soprano ans sopranino ranges) which have
their holes placed for segments of the subharmonic series (harmonics are
blown on these to get the higher pitches on the series). Using these
instruments we are able to navigate the entire 11 limit matrix, and also
play some other tonalities, because of the higher harmonics in some of the
pipes. In addition we have worked with violin and cello players. Personally,
I find the Cosmolyra and Theremin to be my favorites at this time.
