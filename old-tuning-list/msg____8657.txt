In response to Kraig:

Although the Tuning list is a wonderful way to stay in touch, it
can never be as inspiring as hearing what people are doing.  Why
I like the conference idea:

If it could attract people like Erv Wilson and Ben Johnston, we 
might get a chance to hear what they have to say and some musical
examples.

It could have a music festival aspect, too.

Attending a good conference is like drinking at a well of inspiration.
Not all conferences can fulfill this wish, and certainly no conference
can fulfill it for everyone.  But I've been wishing for a long time
to have an annual (or even biannual) conference that would focus the
spotlight on the music I like best and find most interesting --
microtonal music (of all kinds) -- and not just include a few pieces
sometimes as an accident of the selection process.

Supporting a good conference really does take some kind of organization.
The organization is the team that keeps things going.  There is plenty
of freedom for each organization to decide who the team is and what
they want to do -- it doesn't have to be a rigid corporate structure
(like Microsoft) but incorporation often has some long-term legal
benefits (disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer and I'm not prepared to give
the legal advice).  However, we could have the ball start rolling
without that much formality.

Having a conference is the Los Angeles area is an attractive idea
because it would be easy for many people to get to.

Best,
