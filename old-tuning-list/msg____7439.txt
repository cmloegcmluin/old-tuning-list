Subject: Korg X5 DR and Roland JV-1080

From: "Andrew L. Kaye" <androsky@fast.net>

1) Does anyone on the list have experiencing using the Korg X5 DR?  It
is selling for $399 at Sam Ash.  The module has several different
present scales (pelog, "Arabic", just, etc.) and the ability, so I'm
told, to make your own microtonal scales, not limited to the 12-note
octave.  True?  Easy to use?  Fine tunable?  I'd appreciate any reports,
advice.

2) There was also a used Roland JV-1080 for $799.  It seemed a bit more
complicated to make user-defined scales.  Anyone out there with
experience with this module?  Thanks again...
