Subject: Erv Wilson designs

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com> asked for information on Erv Wilson work
on the net.
There are two of Erv's designs at the LucyTuning site, which he and others can
copy/download:

1) His development of the grid-iron at http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/lsd/hexboard.html
2} Erv's tubalong layout at http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/lsd/tubal.html

These were previously published in "Pitch, Pi, amd Other Musical Paradoxes...."
with his permission in the late 1980's..
