Could someone explain to me why many on this list appear to be hung up on
the triad as a systemic harmonic basis? -- sometimes (so it appears to me) 
even to the point of seeing an "abstract triad" as some sort of Platonic
object for which we should be trying to find the closest real-world
approximation (in one universe or another)?  Is there something musically,
physically, or logically sacred about a triadic foundation?

Puzzled,
