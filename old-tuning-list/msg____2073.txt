As mentioned in the previous post,
the elements of the modern place
theory of hearing are found in Helmholtz's
19th-century model of the ear.  Thus it's
worth taking some time to examine
the implications of that model:
"Helmholtz's hearing theory can be
considered as an elaboration of three
hypotheses. In general terms, the first
one is:
"Hypothesis I. The analysis of sound is
accomplished in the inner ear by means
of a large number of resonators tuned
to different frequencies from low to 
high." ["Experiments On Tone Perception,"
Plomp, pg. 102, 1966]
Helmholtz originally ascribed the
"resonator" function to the arches
of Corti but (as mentioned in the 
last post) when he put his ideas down
in his book he changed his mind
and proposed that the transverse 
fibres of the basilar membrane act
as resonators. His arguments were:
[1] In the cochlea of birds, no arches
of Corti are found (Hasse, 1867); [2] 
the width of the basilar membrane
varies from about 0.04 mm at its 
base up to 0.5 mm at the helicotrema
(Hansen, 1863); [3] the membrane is
much more tightly stretched transversely
than longitudinally.
"On the basis of these measurements,
Helmholtz estimated the selectivity
of the resonators, amounting to about
4% of the resonance frequency, with
bandwidth proportional to logarithmic
frequency.
"Hypothesis II. A particular tone-pitch
corresponds to each of the numerous
nerve fibers in such a way that pitch
decreases gradually from the basal to
the apical end of the organ of Corti."
["Experiments On Tone Perception," 
Plomp, R., pg. 103, 1966]
While Helmholtz's hypotheses explained
some aspects of human hearing, it
did not explain others.   In particular,
these hypotheses did not explain how 
combination tones or beats
of mistuned consonances occur.
Thus Helmholtz proposed a third
hypothesis:
"Hypothesis III. The sound transmission
of the ear is characterized by nonlinear
distortion." ["Experiments On Tone
Perception," Plomp, R., pg. 103, 1966]
By means of these 3 hypotheses 
Helmholtz was able to explain much
of the experimental data available
to him in 1863.  
Other aspects of human hearing remained
unexplained.  As Plomp points out, "The
Achilles' heel of his conception was
why periodic sound waves are always
characterized by a pitch corresponding
to the fundamental. ...  Even so, Helmholtz's
theory became widely accepted soon
after its publication under the names
of resonance theory and place theory."
[Plomp, R., 1966, pg. 104]
There were other problems with
Helmholtz's theory.  Whether in modern
form as the "place" theory or in terms
of Helmholtz's original conception, the
pitch sensitivity of the human ear is
significantly greater than the predictions
made on the basis of the place theory.
Moreover, if the ear is primarily  a Fourier 
analyzer, why did it respond to the irregularly-
spaced holes of Seebeck's siren (Seebeck,
1846) with a sensation of definite
pitch not present in any of  the
Fourier components of the waveform
generated when the siren rotated?  
Stumpf, one of the proponents of a
competing theory of hearing, pointed
out these flaws in the original
place theory:
"The view that fibres of 0.5 mm length 
should be tuned to low frequencies did 
not sound very credible and we may
suppose that many agreed with Stumpf's
statement: `It remains wonderful,
however, that so small particles can
resonate even on the lowest tones
that we produce by strings of enormous
size and by which we can bring into
resonance only strings of the same
size.'" [Plomp, 1966, pg. 107; see also
Stumpf, C., "Tonpsychologie," Vol. 2,
Verlag S. Hirzel, Leipzig, 1890, pg. 92]
Plomp points out: "Some investigators
tried to save the resonance hypothesis
by supposing that the resonators
must be sought in other structures of
the cochlea: the hair cells (Baer, 1872;
Hermann, 1894; Myers, 1904; Specht,
1926) or the tectorial membrane (Kishi,
1907; Shambaugh, 1907, 1909, 1911; 
Leiri, 1932). Others, however, rejected
the resonance hypothesis entirely, 
proposing new hearing theories in which
the frequency-analyzing power of the
hearing organ was approached in quite
a different way (Meyer, 1896, 1898,
1899, 1907; Ewald, 1899, 1903,
Wrightson, 1918, and many others)."
[Plomp, 1966, pp. 107-108]
Because of the failure of Helmholtz's
original hypothesis to explain many 
auditory phenomena, many researchers
cast about during the period from the
1840s to the 1860s for another model
of human hearing.  Many researchers
seized upon Seebeck's 1843 proposal
as the answer.
Namely, that "Tones give rise to
synchronous nerve impulses whose
rate determines pitch.  Wundt tried
to evade the difficulty that according
to this hypothesis Bernstein's findings
would suggest a pitch limit at about
1600 cps. He explained that not the
total duration of the nerve impulses
but the much shorter duration of their
peaks might determine the highest
pitch audible..." [Plomp, 1966, pg. 105]
In favor of this competing hypothesis,
called the periodicity theory of hearing, 
two pieces of early evidence were advanced
by Seebeck, Wundt, Stumpf and others:
"1. Binaural beats. Dove (1839) had
pointed for the first time to the fact
that stimulating the ears separately 
with tones of slightly different frequencies
gives rise to slow "binaural beats." Usually,
they were explained as resulting from
bone conduction between the ears (Seebeck,
1846; Mach, 1875; Stumpf, 1890, p. 458;
Schaefer, 1891). Thompson, who discovered
the beats independently, found that they do
not change over into a difference tone when
the frequency difference is increased (1877,
1878, 1881). Therefore, he suggested that
binaural beats are caused by interference in
a higher centre of the auditory pathway."
[Plomp, 1966, pg. 105]
This latter was the first suggestion that the brain was
directly involved in the processing of musical
sounds. Previous theories, like Helmholtz's, 
assumed that the ear did all the processing
required and that the auditory nerve simply
acted as a conduit through which the preprocessed
nerve impulses travelled.   Wundt's and Stumpf's
observations made it clear, however, that the
brain was *part* of the auditory system which
determined pitch, spectral content, etc.--perhaps
*the* crucial part (as subsequent late-20th-century
"pattern transformation" hypotheses of hearing have
stressed).
The second piece of evidence supporting
the Seebeck/Stumpf/Wundt periodicty theory was:
"2. Direct stimulation of the auditory nerve.
The sensational conclusion that the cochlea
is not essential for obtaining an auditory
sensation was drawn independently by
Fano and Massini (1891) and by Ewald (1892).
They based their opinion on the positive
reactions on sound by pigeons with removed
hearing organs. The conclusion was severely
crticized by Matte (1894), Bernstein (1895),
Strehl (1895), and Kuttner (1896), and
defended by Ewald (1895) and Wundt (1895)"
[Plomp, 1966, pg. 106]
Plomp points out that although this second
competing hearing theory could explain
interruption tones and beats of mistuned
consonances much better than Helmholtz's
theory did, its influence was small, perhaps
because Wundt did not work the theory out
in nearly as much detail as did Helmholtz
in the 2nd edition of "On The Sensation of Tone." 
The whole later development of physiological
acoustics can be regarded as an elaboration
of these two competing and contradictory
hypotheses, along with Fetis' 1843 learned-
response theory of hearing. Like Seebeck's
and Stumpf's periodcity theory--which was
largely ignored until Schouten in 1935 performed
a convincing series of experiments which clearly
demonstrated the inadequacy of the place theory
of hearing--Fetis' 1843 theory of learned response
was likewise ignored for many years.  Starting in
the 1950s,  Ward, Burns, Corso, Licklider, and others
performed a series of experiments which cast profound
doubt on many aspects of both the periodicity and
place theory and strongly supported Fetis' 1843 
hypothesis. 
Recently, the auditory artifacts produced by 
cochlear implants have provided strong evidence against
the periodicity theory:  "If we believe the 
extreme position that at low frequencies information is
carried purely by the temporal pattern of nerve impulses,
then periodic electrical stimulation should produce
faithful auditory sensations and good discrimination
of frequencies. The results of electrical stimulation have 
on the whole been disappointing for such a prediction.
In only a few cases to electrical stimuli seem to produce
clear tonal sensations. A typical report is that tones
sound like "comb and paper" (e.g., Fourcin et al., 1979).
[Pickles, James. O., "An Introduction to the Physiology
of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1988, pg. 316]
On the other hand, the place theory also conflicts with
experiment: "In a quasi-linear spectral analyzer such
as the cochlea the physical limits of frequency resolution
are limited by the duration of the stimulus, as a result
of spectral splatter: stimulus duration x spectral line
width = 1.  (..) Temporal theories are not so limited...
(..) On the hypothesis that place and not temporal cues are
used, we can calculate a lower limit for the frequency
difference limen as a function of the length of the
stimulus.  Moore (1973) showed that below 5 khz frequency
discrimination for short stimulus was up to an order of
magnitude better than expected on a place basis. " 
Pickles, James. O., "An Introduction to the Physiology
of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1988, pg. 273]
As a result, "At the moment pattern hypotheses are
dominant..." Pickles, James. O., "An Introduction to the Physiology
of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1988, pg. 273]
The phenomenon of forward and backward masking
also directly contradicts the place theory.  In forward
masking, a masking tone precedes the test tone by a
small time period--in backward masking, the masking
tone occurs *after* the test tone.  If Fourier analysis
is occurring mechanically in the ear, it's difficult to
explain how a second tone appearing *after* the test
tone can interfere with the Fourier analysis.  And in
any case, the fact that masking occurs is a fundamental
problem for Fourier models of hearing. 
"Masking is an example of limitations of the
auditory system's ability to analyze individual frequency
composnents in a complex sound. If the ear were a perfect 
frequency analyzer, then one sound would never mask
the detecability of another sound.  Instead, simultaneously
presented sounds would be independently processed, and the
perpcetion of one would not affect the perception of others.
Masking demnstrates that this ideal state does not exist.
Whenever masking occurs, frequency analysis fails.  When
the presence of a sound of a particular frequency makes it
difficult or impossible to hear another sound of a different
frequency, the ear has failed to analyze and detect the
individual frequency components of the complex sound
created by simultaneous presentation of the two sounds."
[Gulick, W. Lawrence and George A. Geschneider and
Robert D. Frisina, "Hearing: Physiological Acoustics, Neural
Coding, and Psychoacoustics," Oxford University Press,
1988, pg. 300] 
As a result of these pervasive problems with both the
place and periodicity theories of hearing,
 Fetis' model of the ear/brain system
as a feedback path controlled primarily by software (viz.,
learned response) has now gained great currency. 
in part because of the inadequacy of current evidence
In part this is also probably due to increasing use of computers 
and  software in the congitive sciences and their consequent
popularity as a conceptual model for neural systems.
(As will be seen in a future post, a researcher's tools 
exert a potent influence on the mental models he forms.)
If accurate, the "pattern transformation" model of hearing
implies that many different tuning systems and musical
syntaxes are appropriate.  According to this theory of hearing,
no particular complex of overtones has a privleged status
in the ear, and no specific musical tuning is implied as
superior on the basis of the structure of the ear.
Because of the importance of this question for tuning and
music, the next post will examine detailed evidence
for and against the periodicity and place models of 
pitch perception.
