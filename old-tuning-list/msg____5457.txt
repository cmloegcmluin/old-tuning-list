This question of a balance between hitting and missing reminds me of an
article in New Scientist a few years back.  It was actually on the wider
question of predictability in music.  They found that good music was
about having some predictability but not too much.  We are lead along to
expect something and then oops something else happens and is quite
delightful.  It may apply to all aspects of music.

I guess that there is a personal factor in how much we like to be
conformists and how many surprises we can cope with.
