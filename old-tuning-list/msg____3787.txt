Subject: Re: TUNING digest 869

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

I am glad to see a newcomer's question about notation of equal temperaments.
I can offer only my article in Xenharmonikon 16, for which write Frog 
Peak press or the Just Intonation Network.

This will keep you on a five-line staff, however, but comfortably for the
most part. However, there are many other ways to notate, and some members
of the list have criticized my attempt in various ways. No one else has
come up with anything general, however, and you may find that some of the
tunings you are interested in work fine on the 5 lines. Many do. 

Most of my published articles do not discuss notation of equal
temperaments beyond using the 3rd and 5th harmonics. Some day they will. 
Others will guide you I am sure on this matter.

The last few months of this list have been full of discussions relating 
to this.

Meanwhile, maybe you can tell the list which tunings interest you?
