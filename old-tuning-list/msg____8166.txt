Subject: Sound qualities of different keys on mean tone piano

From: <Ascend11@aol.com>

The contribution to the overall sound of a piano note or chord made by st=
rings=0Awhich are excited to vibrate sympathetically with the struck note=
(s) greatly=0Aaffects the character of the overall sound and contributes =
in an essential way=0Ato the acoustic piano's unique characteristics as a=
 musical instrument.  While=0Afor a piano tuned to 12 TET, the harmonic r=
elationships between a string and=0Athe strings above and below it which =
will be excited to vibrate=0Asympathetically with it are nearly the same =
for all the strings in the same=0Ageneral pitch register, these relations=
hips vary greatly between keys for the=0Astrings of a piano tuned to an u=
nequal temperament, including (and especially=0Afor) quarter comma MT tem=
perament.  There are strings at seventh, 14th, etc.=0Apartials for Eb and=
 Bb (wolf from G# to Eb).  There are strings at 5th, 10th,=0Aetc. partial=
s for Eb, Bb, F, C, G, D, A, and E.  There are strings at 3d, 6th,=0A12th=
, etc. partials for all notes but G#.  All notes but G# and C# have notes=
=0Aabove at 9th, 18th, etc. partials above them.  E lacks a note at a 15t=
h=0Apartial above it.  For lower lying notes, Eb lacks a note one octave =
and a=0Afifth below it in the Ab position.  Eb, Bb, F, and C lack notes t=
wo octaves=0Aand a major third below them.

One thing which brought this realization home to me was the very differen=
t=0Acharacter of the sounds of Eb and Bb major triadic chords - and the E=
b strings=0Aalone or when Eb octaves or open fifths Eb=96Bb=96Eb are stru=
ck.  These chords to=0Ame have a difficult=96to=96put=96into=96words "sol=
id" sound which makes me think of=0Avery neat rectilinearly shaped blocks=
 of wood.  The sounds seem low and deep=0Aand solid rather than bright or=
 shrill.  I believe it's the 7th and 14th etc.=0Apartials which are respo=
nsible for this effect.  The key of F, which has Bb=0Aplayed in it regula=
rly, has a solid sound, but not so much as a series of Eb=0Amajor chords.=
  Going the other way to the four notes which lack upper notes at=0Athe 5=
th, 10th, 20th partial positions, these notes have a very "stringy" sound=
=0Awhich can be brought out by playing minor chords on C#, F#, and B.

I notice that when Ebs are played with equal force as C#s, the Ebs sound=
=0Alouder than do the C#s.  Also, the G#s do not seem to have as loud and=
=0Acarrying a sound as most of the other notes.

As a result of having the good fortune to be able to "play around" with a=
=0Apiano which my piano tuner has been able to accurately put into differ=
ent=0Atemperaments, I can get a first hand sense of a "new" field of dime=
nsions=0Aalong which that amazingly versatile (as we now know) instrument=
 can be=0Acontrolled so as to produce a wide variety of sounds with diffe=
ring=0Acolorations and quality balances.=0A
