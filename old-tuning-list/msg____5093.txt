   I would like to bring to light another augmented sixth chord that may or
may not be appropriate to the 4-5-6-7-8 topic, but maybe a new one. Im
thinking about the "French Augmented 6th chord".  It came up in today's
music class (De Anza College / Dr. Paul Setziol) while discussing
Schubert's _Der_Doppelganger_ C. 957 song.  The b minor piece basically
ambiguously toys with the b minor and f# major sonorities.  In mm 32-33 the
chord is C E F# A#, the Fr6.  My teacher describes it as a non-tertian
sonority.  Its intruiging placement in the music is that is resolves to b
minor, and not to e minor, which is the traditional progression.  He also
talks about the roles of each within the voice-leading context, and
delegates the acoustical context to claiming it's "non-tertian", not based
on a acoustic triad like the 4-5-6 relationship.
   What is the acoustical basis for this chord / unique sonority?  What is
the tuning implications of using a non-tertian sonority as a dominant or
penultimate or half-cadence function?  Id like to tie in the traditional
music theory with something more responsible to current
paradigms/controversies....  etc etc
