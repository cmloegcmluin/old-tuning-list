''Most piano tuning supply houses should sell a G# fork at 415.3 cps. I would be interested in how the students are instructed (learn) to
tune the harpsichords and fortepianos.''

I learned how from Douglas Leedy around 1976, when he was an instructor at
the Early Music Workshop in Idyllwild, CA. He gave us a single page with
instructions for pythagorean, quarter comma meantone, and two or three well
temperaments. We practiced tuning beatless octaves, fifths, and Major
thirds, and then learned to count beats in the reference octave using a
watch with a second hand or a metronome. I suspect most students learn
similar methods - although digitial tuners may be used more frequently
nowadays in setting the tempered intervals. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
