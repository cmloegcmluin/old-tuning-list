Subject: forum CD info

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

The deal with the forum CD is this: each contributor gets a certain 
amount of copies, to do whatever he wants to with. I don't mind selling 
some of mine, and I have no idea how the other folks involved feel. I 
would suggest that any of the participants in the project who want to 
sell some, put a post on the forum, and let people know...it's almost 
done, so we'll be keeping you posted...Hstick  PS I sell my CD's for $12, 
which includes postage...
