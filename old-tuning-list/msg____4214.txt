Subject: about that Brian McLaren in Tuning digest 893...

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

In early November I had rushed surgery to remove
a large agressive cyst from my left thigh. Needless to say,
now that that huge thing is gone (no cancer), the whole process
has been a pain in the leg. (Funny, where is he going with this?)

This evening I was catching up on Tuning digest since I've
been busy recovering and catching up the back load
of work in my family business. To my suprise, I found myself
as an example in one McLaren's charming rants.

In an article titled "WWW and microtonality" 
and posted on Tue, 12 Nov 1996 09:19:05 -0800 (PST)
the ever charming Brian McLaren writes:

If you can't even guess why this information is there, 
you aren't in much of a position to comment! Understand?

Yadda-yadda-yadda? Look who's talking! Understand?

Check it out: a guy who doesn't even own a modem criticizing 
a web page I didn't create in a forum I couldn't respond to 
because I was recovering from surgery. Ha!

I don't know who has been taking old posts of mine to Tuning 
Digest and making web pages out of 'em. If web neophyte 
McLaren wants to whine, he should get his own damn web 
pages. First, however, he will need a modem and an isp. 

Understand?

He can look at my own web pages and check out
my work. I spent a lot of time on those pages. About 60 or 70
pages worth. While Juxtaposition Ezine is for reviews, 
not all the reviews are JI oriented. 

* * * yet another shameless promo!!! * * *

He's also welcome to purchase a copy of A Recital Without 
Musicians: The 1995 Trenton Avant-Garde Festival   
Electro-Acoustic compilation. This tape has my JI composition 
"Science Friction" using the intervals: 

1/1, 17/16, 9/8, 19/16, 5/4, 21/16, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 27/16, 7/4, 15/8.

See the IMMP site for more details.

* * * end of shameless promo * * *

I been on the Tuning list for about 2 1/2 years and I am well
acquainted with BM's writings and the reaction they provoke.
I normally wouldn't waste my time responding to BM, but
since he made a special effort to pick me out of millions
on the net, I'm putting in my 1200 cents.

One request: maybe BM could stay on topic? 
The forum IS about tunings other then 12tet. 

Wow! I managed to get this far and not call him any names.

Sorry to waste the bandwidth folks...

say cheese,
