From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Thanks Paul, we are talking about different things.  The irony is that 
the difficulty with which we try to express musical concepts on the internet 
shows up the problems with computer notation we are presently reading.

Cents notation uses all the symbols of 24ET: this means that a 969 would 
be notated as a B natural with a "-41" above the notehead (assuming C as 
the fundamental).  Hearing the basic essential intervals of consonance 
(and perhaps dissonance) must be internalized by players independently by 
players.
 
Perhaps we players are using cents the way Yamaha uses its 1024 points of 
reference. Only our expansion to 1200 is more accurate.

Incidentally, does the list know that Johann Philipp Kirnberger, prize 
student of J.S. Bach invented the notation of "i" before the very same B 
natural to indicate that it was a 7/4 relationship (of 969 cents)?
