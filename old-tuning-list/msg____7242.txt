John Chalmers' answer to the confusion between ancient Greek and medieval
ecclesiastical modes is correct, however, so is the original statement
that the medieval theorists determined the modal structure from the
opposite direction.  In determining the particular modal scale, the
Greeks started "counting notes" at the highest note and went downward,
while medieval musicians started at the lowest pitch and ascended. 
Spacing the intervals in the same order as the Greeks, but in the
opposite direction, gave the ecclesiastical correspondences Chalmers
described.
