I don't know what the best one can expect is, but I seem to recall piano
tuners on the list mentioning that their students are expected to
achieve 0.1 cent accuracy on their piano tuning exams, and that seems
about the right ballpark to me in terms of what I would like from a
synthesizer.  1-cent resolution isn't really accurate enough to capture
the subtle differences between various shades of meantone, as someone
else (I forget who) pointed out over the weekend.
