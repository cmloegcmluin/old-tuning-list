   Hmmm...

   Well, if you're investigating the meaningfulness of a scientific
conclusion, you would use scientific rather than mystical means.  If you're
investigating the meaningfulness of a mystical conclusion, then you would
have to investigate them through mystical means rather than scientific.  

   In that latter scenario, neither the premise nor the conclusion, both
mystical, would be measurable (if they were then the question would be a
scientific one rather than a mystical one).  So scientific principles would
be of no value, because they only operate on measurable quantities.  

   Now I suppose one could investigate a scientific question through
mystical means if they feel so inclined, but from a scientific perspective
it would be pointless, because the only a subsequent proof would carry any
scientific interest.  And the mystical evaluation of what is
well-understood scientifically is of marginal interest mystically speaking.
 

   As an example of that, one might ask about the mystical meaning of why a
basketball's speed increases 9.8 meter per second per second when you drop
it.  That's a boring question mystically speaking, because the answer is
completely unmysterious:  That's how fast objects fall when attracted by an
object the size and mass of the Earth.

   Now on the other hand, I can see plenty of mystical value in posing the
question of why the Universe should have a force of gravity at all, or why
it should behave such that objects fall at that rate.  That's a perfectly
good mystery.  One could pose all kinds of suggestions for that.  Perhaps
one my propose, for example, that it is a means of testing the human will
to build tall buildings or to fly.  Or perhaps, from a very different
perspective, one might propose that it is impossible for a universe to even
exist without a force with the qualities gravity has.  That latter one
could possibly even blossom into a scientific theory, but for now it's
intriguing mysticism.
