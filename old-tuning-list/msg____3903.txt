If more than a few cents variations are put in front of a performer, I'd
guess that either it wouldn't make any difference, or it would be
difficult, unless you want only gross approximations.

I must say that the concept of modern woodwind instruments playing
microtonal music is one that does not interest me much. Not meant to upset
Johnny, who probably has more experience in this than anyone, but I don't
find the resultant timbres acceptable in many cases, and the awkward
fingerings work against all the developments of these instruments in the
past 200 years (possibly bassoon excepted). 

Johnny, I'd be interested in your comments on this.

I don't think so. In JI in particular, the relationships are important,
and you may not have to have a score, although knowing where your note
"comes from" is significant. It may come from a previously sounding note. 
And in a fair amount of JI, the number of different notes in a passage
(however defined) may not be high, so that memorizing a relationship sign
isn't difficult, and no more so than a cents value. I agree that it's not
easy, and in ETs it's still harder. 

It won't take a sharp person to figure that I don't work with performers
very often in this material, partly because all the notations are a
problem, which reflects bigger problems in actually performing the music
with all but the most dedicated and experienced performers. In the
electronic case, the relationships in the score are paramount and then the
cents variations are not helpful unless you've memorized their
relationships--in which case why not use the relationships directly? 

I wouldn't want, however, to teach people to hear and play the 13th 
harmonic in relation to 12-tET. Gary, is that what you meant?
