Pieter, I missed your question but saw some other replies.  When you 
use the word "natural" I have some very definite opionions about this.
If you go to my WWW pages (URL below) you can get the long version which
I think you might enjoy given the questions you are thinking about.

While there is some validity to what you have done in your post, it is
not the complete story.  In practice if you just take frequencies 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, etc and work out the notes by transposing back to one octave
then you have assumed that the ratio of 2 (the octave transpose) is more
important than all other ratios.  That is actually true, but the ratios
3, 5, 7 etc are successively less important.  Therefore the ratios of 11
and 13 are rather seldom really found in music and your 11/8 is more
likely to be 21/16 but is generally really 4/3.

Yes.  The JI scale is 1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2.  The next two
most common notes that can be added to the JI scale are 7/6 and 7/4 for
Eb* and Bb* if the above scale is C.  I like to express this by
eliminating the denominator as: 24 27 (28) 30 32 36 40 (42) 45 48.

[* What is the correct notation for this?  Is it Mi-flat and Ti-flat?]

In nature the ratios of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... tend to occur with a
commonness of about 100, 42, 17, 10, 5, 4, ... so that when we have
numbers with just one ratio of 5 present we can expect 2 or 3 ratios of
3 and about 6 ratios of 2 and a ratio of 7 would then have about a 60%
chance of being present.
