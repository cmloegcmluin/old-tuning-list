In a response to my post, someone said "Chorusing?!!, I've never had that
unless I was retuning several semitones."

I was retuning more than several semitones, so I guess that explains it.

Thanks for the input, 
Jesse.

PS the reason I was doing drastic tuning is that I was trying to create an
octave of pitches using one starting tone(the original sample) in an
attempt to avoid resampling, which I thought might cause more
discrepancies.
