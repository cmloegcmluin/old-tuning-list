I'm not sure what everybody says about this, but according to Harry Partch the
12-tone scale is derived from both the partials themselves and their relations
to each other.  For instance, the perfect fourth is derived from the fourth 
partial's relation to the third partial, transposed to be in relation to the 
fundamental.  The seconds and sevenths must be derived by partials of partials,
for instance the minor sixth is derived from the fifth partial's relationship 
to the eighth partial (which is found as the fourth partial of the second 
partial's overtone series, thus staying within the five-partial limit).
If your fundamental is C, then, you get an "A flat" in your scale because it is
a minor sixth up from the fundamental, even though that tone does not occur in 
the harmonic series.
	I assume that Partch's thinking is in line with other theorists, but 
with Partch you never know.  The information above I got from _Interval_, 
when they published an early draft of an intro to _Genesis_ called 
"Exposition of Monophony."  I hope this is some of what you were looking to 
find out, and I realize this may be stuff you already knew.
