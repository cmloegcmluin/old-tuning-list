Subject: millioctaves

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

Great idea!  I've been using these for years, since before I
discovered the rest of the world used cents.  Silly things,
surprised they caught on.  It would certainly make things easier
for me if everyone else came round to my way of thinking, although
this does run into problems with reality.

As to the notation, I suggest "moct" so that you can switch to
"oct" when the intervals get big enough.  2.735 oct makes a lot
more sense to me than 3282 cents.  I prefer mET to MET: the latter
would imply megaoctaves!  Microoctaves also have their uses: the
MIDI Tuning Standard works to 5 mu-oct, doesn't it?

Apart from removing the 12TET bias, octaves are easier to
calculate : p log2(f/f_0); f0*2^p.  Step sizes of equal
temperaments can be worked out really easily -- sometimes in your
head.

I've also been using octaves to denote absolute pitches, with
f_0z. Once you know that middle C corresponds to about  8.04
oct, you know that 10.128 oct must be somewhere above the treble
clef.  What does 1119 Hz mean?  Setting f_0Hz may be better,
equivalent to subtracting 4 oct, and around the threshold of
hearing.  The fractional part can also be replaced with a note
name: 8.04 oct becomes 8C, 8.78 oct becomes 8A. This can be
generalised for any tuning system you like.

Well, that's the way I see it, anyway.
