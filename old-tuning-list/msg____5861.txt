Sorry, I agree with Dan here. What is true for rationals may not be true
for their best approximations in a set of irrationals. 768tET is a poor
example because you're likely to treat that many notes as a continuous
pitch spectrum. 18tET (Busoni's third-tone system) is a much better
example. By far the best and most consonant approximation of 9/4 is 21
steps. This can only be construed as 3/2*3/2 if two different values of
3/2 are used! In other words, the factorization of 9 into primes is at
best irrelevant and at worst counterproductive in some cases.

What an odd question! What could you possibly mean by it?

Yes, there are these different and equally valid concepts of
dimensionality. In my previous posts in which I talk about dimensions I
am more concerned with harmonic dimensionality.
