Subject: At last, he shuts up...

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Steve Curtin has the best idea yet:

A big worry of mine during all of this.  I know I mentioned not being Just-
or N-ET-centric, and I hope I have not overstayed my welcome.  I came by
because colleagues had indicated to me a general discussion of Partch (with
not all sides represented, quite).  I lurked, asked a couple of questions
and was encouraged to post.

Therefore, my apologies if this has gone on *way* too long, and my thanks
for Steve to at least hint in that direction in a very congenial manner.
And what I couldn't agree with more:

Absolutely!  It is time to create new music, new works, all parties
concerned.  In this light, it matters not a whit whether you like or dislike
the works of HP.  As someone had remarked about Timotheus of Sparta: "He had
failed to realize that to dream of desirable changes is one thing; to act
upon those dreams is another."

Then, to dreams, and to action...

Cheers,
Jon

P.S. I'll be lurking and available for questions -- here, our site or my
email addr.

And Enrique, just how did you find out about the Ceremonial Robes in my closet?
