Subject: Correction, Midi Tuning Standard

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

There were two errors in my last post: I should have written 768 not 
728 tones per octave, but the second one M( is some strange software 
error for MIDI as it looked fine on my screen. I noticed recently, since 
I was moved to Deltanet, that corrections sometimes transmit differently 
from what my screen shows. Sometimes saving the file and reopening it 
helps, but not always.  
 
>find the current 1024 and 728 tone/octave M(pitch resolutions far
>too coarse for his work. 
 
Anyway, thanks Steve, I'll transmit your reply to Erv today.
