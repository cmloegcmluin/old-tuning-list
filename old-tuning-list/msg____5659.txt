George Kahrimanis and I have been discussing tunings of the 6th chord (aka 
the minor seventh chord). The two alternatives are 12:15:18:20 
(15:1/12:1/10:1/9), and 14:18:21:24 (36:1/28:1/24:1/21). Kami Rousseau 
suggested the latter on this list some time ago.

I would agree with you here. This motivates my adherence to the odd-number 
definition of limits. However, as I demonstrated, every interval in Kami's 
chord is within the 9-limit, which is also true of 12:15:18:20. So the 21 is 
not really that bad. If we want to look at the full chord, Kami's is a 
21-limit utonality or 21-limit otonality, which I agree is more complex than 
the 12:15:18:20, which is only a 15-limit utonality or otonality.

But psychoacoustically, and this should be evident to a listener, these 
chords are no more dissonant that a 9-limit utonality. I believe that this is 
because THE ONLY REASON UTONALITIES ARE CONSONANT IS BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL 
INTERVALS ARE CONSONANT. The common overtone is there but doesn't make the 
chord more consonant. Once again, I don't believe in dualism. So even though 
the 6th chords above may seem to demand explanation in terms of the 15- and 
21-limit, I would say, if you admit utonalities at all, then both those 
chords are 9-limit chords, no higher.

I wonder if there are any 7-limit analogues to these chords (i.e., chords in 
which each interval is within the 7-limit but the chord as a whole is in a 
higher limit). I think the answer is no. Anyone care to come up with a 
counterexample?

BTW, I don't think the 13-limit is inherently less consonant than the 15- or 
17-limits. I think the 15-limit shows up a lot incidentally, due to combining 
5- and 3-limit intervals, and I think the 17-limit was discovered in the 
diatonic scale and so is very familiar. Ironically, my use of 22-equal 
prevents me from exploring the 13-limit; leaving 13 out, everything through 
the 17-limit is consistently expressed in 22-equal.
