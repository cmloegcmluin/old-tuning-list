Yes, this is exactly what I meant.  Most excellent, dude.

Rasch lists this paper in his paper, but he does not mention that it
mentioned 22 in particular.  Rather, he says it presents serveral theorems
about equal temperaments in general, mostly stuff that plays with order,
class, and number of tones to make comparisons with 12tET.

I'm anxious to read the article...
