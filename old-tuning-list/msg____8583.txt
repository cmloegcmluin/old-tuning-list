Hello all!

I am now back online.  My cross-country trip turned out
entirely differently than I had intended.  Sorry that so
many of you on the west coast who were expecting
to see me never did, but I'm there myself now, so it
won't be too long...

I ended up spending the entire summer in Phoenix,
Arizona, and haven't yet been able to return to the
east coast.

I am now living in San Diego, working closely with
Jonathan Glasier, former editor of the seminal
microtonal journal "Interval" and long-time San
Diegan, and Denny Genovese, former director
of the Southeast Just-Intonation Center of Gainesville,
Florida, and now also in San Diego.

Together, we are forming a microtonal center here
and hope to galvanize interest in Southern California
in microtonality (especially just-intonation) and
forge a community of musicians with a center
for performing, recording, sequencing, etc.

We are currently developing a website, and
I will post the URL as soon as it's finished.

I may be reached personally at my old email:

monz@juno.com

or preferably my new one below.

I've been out-of-touch with this for a while,
so I'm eager to debate things again...
