   That's an interesting question;  I'm not sure, and I'd be curious to
know as well.

   A couple of additional notes on that term:
1.  Blackwood was especially fascinated by the 10-toned (2121212121) 
    in 15TET, because it's also a superset of the 15TET major scale 
    (3213231).
2.  My saxophone teacher (a jazz man, even though I'm historically more
    of a classical kinda guy) was also familiar with that term, with
    reference to the octaphonic 21212121 scale in 12TET (which is
    apparently is sometimes called a "diminished" scale).
