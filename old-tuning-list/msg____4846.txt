Sorry, I disagree with you about comma shifts. Melody is historically and 
aesthetically prior to harmony. If the unaccompanied melody uses equal-sized 
whole tones and no comma shifts, then the harmonized melody should too.

"Derivative" means "rate of change" of a function in calculus. What I was 
getting at is that if you assume that dissonance has a local minima at 
certain simple just ratios (I believe this is certainly true at least for 
5-limit intervals smaller than one octave), and make the additional 
assumption that the rate of change of the rate of change is finite and not 
zero at these minima, then a quadratic function is appropriate: the 
dissonance function must be shaped like a parabola if you are close to the 
just ratio.

This may be a valid issue but is irrelevant here, since we are merely 
comparing representations of the same interval(s).

That is the issue and I assume a quadratic function as justified above. 
Many, many other justifications are possible.

Very well.
