Subject: RE: Sixth comma meantone temperament: "per comune opinione perfet

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Thanks for the interesting experiences. I posted some time ago to the
effect that the optimal meantone tuning for triadic harmony was
something very close to 3/11-comma meantone, but for diatonic dominant
sevenths something close to Pythagorean is optimal, and for diatonic
dominant ninths an even larger fifth is preferable. I don't remember the
exact numbers but I can dig it up if you wish (or check the archives). I
do think 12tET effectively mediates between these different options.

Late last night I tuned my Ensoniq to an approximation of quarter-comma
meantone by alternating 697 and 696 cent fifths in the tuning tables. So
the good major thirds are all represented by 386 cents in the tables.
Since the true tuning resolution of the Ensoniq is 512 notes/octave,
these come out as 165/512 octave or 386.7 cents, comparing well enough
with the just value of 386.3 cents that it really sounds like true QC
meantone.
