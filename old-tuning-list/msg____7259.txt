I just looked a Juxtaposition Ezine's site today

http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/j_index.htm

and noticed that the microtonal content is in magenta. This is a good 
tool! Also, I read there that Genesis of a Music is back in print. 
Hurrah. Now, what are we going to do about finding a home for the Partch 
collection? On a happier note, the last time I was at the Exploratorium in 
San Francisco I noticed a couple of new microtonal demonstrations. This 
means kids are being exposed to microtonality and actually get to play 
microtonal instruments.
