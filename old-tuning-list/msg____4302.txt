pitch.**

**Quick** here must refer to the duration of the trill rather than the
speed. A trill of any duration and sufficient speed will tend to create an
audible dyad (especially on the Harpsichord, whose damping mechanism is
rather slow: Ligeti's _Continuum_ uses such rapid playing to striking
effect and the tuning is quite transparent).

Bill´s remarks about portamento are, I think, more typical of Hindustani
music than Karnatic where a portamento of more than a fourth and more than
one beat in duration is extremely rare. Many list members may be familiar
with the exhuberant octave-or-more ascending portamenti used especially by
Muslim vocalists. (I am especially fond of long portamenti that overreach
the target pitch, then fall back to the target precisely with a strong
position in the tala). The ideas of Nazir Jairazbhoy about tempering raise
a really different and interesting conception of _temperament_ than is
usually encountered in this forum, that of deliberate deviations from just
intervals to put those intervals into a kind of audible relief. (Perhaps
deliberate **out of tuneness** would make an interesting discussion
topic!).  

In answer to a question posted off the list: The gamakas I indicated in my
posting are practiced at all speeds, from ca. one step 60 to two, four,
eight times as fast, where  the dyadic effect is quite pronounced.
