Subject: comments about Lucytuning

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Haverstick here...a brief comment on Lucytuning. I am reacting to 
Morrison's comments, which said something to the effect that Lucy angers 
the just intonation folks because he believes that Lucytuning is the 
ideal tuning system, and that small whole number ratios are seen as valid 
insofar as they approximate Lucytuning (if I missed it here, please 
correct me).
    Anyway, my point is this: the harmonic series, with it's infinite 
series of relationships, is a part of the Creation. We did not invent 
this system, and can only react to it in various ways. We can try to play 
exactly within the framework of what is there, the ratios, or we can 
change them, which gives us various temperaments. But, no matter which 
way we deal with it, the 3/2 ratio IS a "perfect 5th"; the 5/4 IS a 
"perfect 3rd"...these intervals have exact mathematical values which 
definitely affect the way they sound when used in a musical context, and 
no matter what we, as humans, think about the Harmonic Series, when we 
deviate from it, we change a part of the Creation that is pure; what this 
means, exactly, I'm not sure if we yet know. But, any tuning that changes 
these basic, fundamental values, is less than perfect, to my way of 
thinking.
    Now, I play equal temperaments, because I love chordal music with 
lots of changes; we all know, in fact, that temperaments came about to 
play just this kind of music. I love Bach, Bartok, Charlie Parker, etc.; 
I also love the modal music of India, Arabia, Turkey, etc. My point, 
basically, is this; once you deviate from the purity of the Harmonic 
Series, don't go thinking that you've improved on what was already there. 
To me, as much as I enjoy eq temperaments, I don't think for a moment 
that I have invented something superior to the mystery of the HS; I know 
that eq temps are a compromise that allows me to play the style of music 
I like, and nothing more. Perhaps, someday, someone will come up with a 
way to play Bach fugues in pure tunings (and I mean in a practical way, 
not complex synthesizers that are only for a few); that would be neat. 
But, I doubt if that will happen, so I will continue to alter my 5ths so 
my 3rds sound better, etc.
    If Lucy thinks that his variation of the Harmonic Series is better   
than the real thing, then I do not understand his reasoning. Perhaps he 
could put a post on the forum which will clarify things, to avoid any 
misunderstandings. Again, I see all temperaments as a compromise, and in 
no way superior to what already exists...Hstick
