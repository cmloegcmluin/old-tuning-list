>PATRICK GRANT: Fields Amaze (Silent Treatment) Grant's
>music is clearly Balinese inspired, and he's helped out on this disc
>by musicians from Gamelan Son of Lion. But there's also a driving
>and rather harsh energy redolent of rock, as well as a cleanly
>(Western) melodicism. Motorically "snapped to grid", in computer
>parlance, the music's momentum and intricate cross-rhythms rarely
>let up, making the occasional infectious tunes that emerge all the
>more beautiful for surprise. "A Visible Track of Turbulence" and
>"Relative Segments" are for classical chamber ensembles, but it's
>the slight microtonal piano retunings in the other works - "Fields
>Amaze", my favorite, and "Everything Distinct: Everything the
>Same" - that give the music a highly original punch.

>More and more young composers are determined to fuse their
>formal training with popular and world music influences. Few,
>however, come up with results that add up to more than the sum of
>their parts, like Patrick Grant, whose debut CD (Silent Treatment
>1709 MLTV) is out now. A lack of program notes and biographical
>information imply that Grant intends the music to speak for itself.
>In truth, the Detroit reared composer is in his early thirties, has
>worked a lot with dance and multimedia, and performs regularly
>with Gamelan Son Of Lion.  "Fields Amaze," the opening work on
>the disc, blends traditional gamelan with a microtonal keyboard,
>weaving an intriguing tapestry of non-pitched sounds with lively
>rhythmic patterns that culminate in a driving pedal point that is
>almost Bachian in effect. "A Visible Track of Turbulence" is
>scored for more conventional forces. Grant's writing for flute,
>clarinet and piano emphasizes long lines and rigorously
>constructed rhythmic phrases, yet never really exploits the
>instruments on their own terms. "Everything Distinct: Everything
>the Same", for three percussionists and just as many keyboards
>tuned in meantone temperament reveals the composer's strong
>theoretical bent. I am especially fond of the four movement
>"Relative Segments," which bristles with upbeat invention
>throughout, notably in its harmonic and metric slights of hand. It
>has an evocative slow movement that reveals a lyric gift I hope
>Grant will explore more extensively in future works. One suspects
>much of this music would easily appeal to young choreographers
>looking for something out of the ordinary yet accessible at the
>same time. You can obtain this CD directly from the composer @
>Silent Treatment (BMI), 1173A 2nd Avenue, Suite 322, New
>York, NY 10021, or via the Internet (mrpgrant@mail.idt.net).
