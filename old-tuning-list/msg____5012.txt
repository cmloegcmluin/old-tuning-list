I didn't know about this but found it fascinating because I believed
that A=440 was too low.  My reasons for this are several.  Anyway, 443
is still too low it should be 450.

1. In indian music the note "ni" is 450 Hz.  For the Indian music scale
see http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif

2. There often exists an electromagnetic standing wave around the earth
called the Schumann resonance.  It has one main frequency mode given by
the speed of light divided by the earth's circumference or 300,000km/s /
40,000 km or 7.5 Hz.  When the natural Just Intonation scale is
calculated with this as a base you get 
ratio      24    27    30    32    36    40    45    48
*7.5 Hz   180   212.5 225   240   270   300   337.5 360
Which gives 225 Hz or 450 Hz exactly the same as the Indian music
frequency.

3. Before the standard A=440 was set the naturally chosen value was
heading for 450 (please correct me on this one).

4. The tempo of music, which may be seen as an extension of the key, is
found to favour a slightly faster or slightly higher A.  This also leads
me to an answer of 450.  I will do a seperate post about this another
time as it is another whole subject.

So I think that people naturally want to use notes that fit the
frequencies in 2 above which will be the key of F and other keys based
on that.  That is because our brains are affected by e/m fields in
general and the Schumann resonance in particular (this is well
established).  Any other option is against (our) nature.
