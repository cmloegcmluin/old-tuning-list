At the danger of seeming to push my work forward, may I suggest that
you look at the cps2pch and cpsxpch opcodes, as there are designed to
assiste with ET tunings.  For JT systems it seems that describing teh
pitch as two integers whose ratio is the requirement, possibly with an
octave number is sufficient.
