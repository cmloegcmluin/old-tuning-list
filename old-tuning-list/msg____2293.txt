No, I haven't.  I was referring (about static music) to the cornucopia of 
harmonic-series works of his like "In a Large Open Space", "Spectral 
Canon", "Saxony", etc.

"Big Gulp"'s tuning is 11-limit: 1/1, 33/16, 9/8, 28/12, 5/4, 21/16, 
11/8, 3/2, 99/64, 27/16, 7/4, 15/8.  It should be a good scale for piano 
music which sounds convincing yet distinctly xenharmonic.

Of course it is nice to write for an ensemble, but when it comes to 
analyzing a tuning purely, a solo keyboard may be ideal. Adding 
instruments, especially ones without fixed-pitch,  would muddy up the sound 
and act as a "cover" for hearing the true relationships.  I also find 
that the more action is involved (varied instruments, harmonic motion, 
etc.), the less xenharmonic a piece sounds.  This is taken from comments 
of non-JI musicians who I have listen to it.

A couple of questions:
-Who is "Twinings"?  I haven't heard his music.
-Is the consensus that harmonic "pull" towards another tonality is the 
same in a just-equivalent of 12TET?  Could the dominant triad not be more 
effective in 12TET because the triadic third is more dissonant (the 
sharper quality may lead the ear more strongly to the tonic).

Thanks for the discussion and keep it coming.
