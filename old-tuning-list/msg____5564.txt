Subject: Modes, Diamonds, Barstow & pun

From: Greg Schiemer <gregs@mail.usyd.edu.au>

Apologies to all contributors on the list if the answers to my enquiries
are readily available in an FAQ. Johnny Reinhard's post gets closest to
answering my original question about JI modes. Thanks to all the others.

This is probably the way I should have asked the question in the first
place. Pieter's deduction seems right to me and I await with interest an
answer to his question. 

I have another beginner's problem this time understanding the 5-limit
Incipient Tonality Diamond of Partch (diagram 5. p110 Genesis of Music).
I'll spell out what I think it is so someone can correct me.

I've understood that the diamond is a matrix which has a centred vertical
axis representing 1/1. The ratios are arranged so that identities 1 3 & 5
on one of the diagonal axes represent 3 major triad made up of JI 3rds and
5ths and on the other diagonal axis 3 minor triad made up of JI 3rds and
5ths. By doing this Partch solves the super-tonic problem associated with
5-limit tuning (Doty p.37).

The scale Partch uses to describe the concept is 

		G --- Bb - B - C - D - Eb - E --- G. 

Here is the same scale represented on the 5-limit Incipient Tonality
Diamond using JI intervals

				3/3
					
			5/3	 	6/5

		4/3		5/5		3/2

			8/5		5/4

				1/1

If 1/1 is represented by G how is the same diamond represented ?
 
				G

			E		Bb

		C		G		D

			Eb		B

				G

Ignoring the fact that these pitches are those normally used to describe
12-tET, is this correct ? 

I've recently introduced a class to 3- 5- & 7-limit JI scales using David
Doty's book, Scala & Csound. Before we move on to 11-limit tuning I wanted
to understand how Partch arrived at it, hence my question about the
diamond. We've also listened to John Schneider's recording of Barstow.
Compared with the first commercial recording with all its percussive
timbres, I was amazed to hear how consonant the intervals sounded and how
much darker the mood of this piece becomes on the guitar. Alternate tuning
is not on the curriculum here. I just snuck it in. These undergraduates
composers are now sold on JI. Csound and Scala have played a big role in
this. It would be nice to look at non-12 tET as well as JI tunings.

On the subject of puns, I don't suppose many people on this list are aware
that Warren Burt wrote a piece for the old Fairlight CMI some years ago
which he called "Justice Equality & Beatings".
