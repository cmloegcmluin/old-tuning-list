   I'll agree with that up to a point.  I'd certainly agree if producing
good musical theories and producing good music were both equal end-results.


   I enjoy theorizing as much as the next tuning-lister, but I have to
agree with Neil that a beautiful theory is an incomplete end-result, and
that beautiful music produced upon a beautiful theory is the completed
end-result.
