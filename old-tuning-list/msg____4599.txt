Yeah, I hear that too. Perhaps it is more a phenomenon of the melody and the
pitch set developing together rather than one generating or limiting the other.
Either way, I hear in my own imagination, music which is not limited by a
pitch set, but is more guided by intervalic connection, especially in 
regards to chord progressions and continuous modulations. I also get the 
sense that there's more to the expressive nature of melody than picking
from a set. Starting with just a wail, which is a glissando with a curvature
which evokes emotion, there's something going on there with regards to shape
and time which is transcendent of the idea of a "scale".

I see.

Ah.

Or to 22tet's approximation of 4/3.

Ok.
