Subject: microtonal MIDI

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

I've used the method Brian described, of distributing music 
across multiple channels according to note value, for some 
time now to tune my MIDI harpsichord. It works perfectly for 
me. In addition, if you use a modern computer and sound card, 
you don't need a hard disk recorder - a 386 with Cubase and a 
SoundBlaster 32 keeps up with 16 channels simultaneously in 
real-time playback.
