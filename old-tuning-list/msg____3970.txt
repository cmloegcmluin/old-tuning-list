Actually there's an arcifoon here in St. Louis, thanks to the efforts of
Leigh Gerdine and his connection with the Netherlands 31-tone
contingent.  I've played on it some, and while workable it's not the
greatest--the keys are electric-typewriter keys, blech.  I'd much prefer
something like the generalized keyboard that Wendy Carlos diagrams in
the 1988 _Computer Music Journal_ Microtonality issue, with keys roughly
the size and shape of standard piano black keys.

In that issue, Wendy mentioned the (pipe-dreamish) possibility of
pressuring some manufacturer to make such a keyboard that could be used
as a front-end to drive MIDI instruments.  I'd love it if it could
actually happen, but as far as I've seen the xenharmonic community has
yet to accumulate sufficient clout.
