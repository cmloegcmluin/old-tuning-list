Subject: RE: Equal Divisions -- of What?

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

As I started this off, I may as well explain myself.  By the
"harmonic series" I meant the set of harmonic overtones. I forgot
that there was a quite different harmonic series in maths.  It's
one of those confusing things like 13 being a lucky number.

My point is that the overtone series exploits the same symmetry
as ETs, but in a different scale.  JI can be derived from this
series, and so exploits the symmetry.  Where subsets of an ET are
used, the analogy is even better, as we are dealing with small
integer ratios in both cases.

If I routinely use "pitch" to mean the logarithm of frequency,
will people understand what I mean?
