Subject: gen keyboards--Clavette2:The Next Generation

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

Thanks to Manuel for keeping teh rest of the world updated on the
generalized keyboard ideas emanating from the Netherlands these days.

And thanks to Mr. Aschour, I soon will contact Francois Paris to learn
more about his system.

In the meantime, you should know that I am making progress in finding
engineers to start on a Clavette2, which would basically be like
the existing Clavettes, but with 250-300 keys which would be
velocity sensitive.

NOTHING IS YET CERTAIN, but I've at least interested some local
electronic engineers in the "CPU problem", and am working on finding
some people brilliant with sensors, and perhaps finding a
mechanical engineer.

Once this instrument is built, I do plan to have additional copies
made on a per-order basis, but of course all of this is likely to
be a few years down the road yet.

If you are not familiar with the Clavette, you can read about it
in the 1995 ICMC Proceedings, or a few more details in the 1994
Yearbook of the Stichting Huygens-Fokker. 

I still expect the Clavette's future model to be a MIDI controller
keyboard/pedal system, rather than include any synthesis or
intelligent real-time just tuning adjustments system.

Yours truly,
HAROLD
