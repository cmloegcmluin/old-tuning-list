I said 3 for simplicity.  If you want to pick nits, lots of trumpets have
other numbers of valves.  On the "3" example, if the fundamentals of the
sections are set as you say, then there's actually only 6 horns.  However,
on many horns, 1st and 2nd does not equal 3rd.  And let's not forget that at
least the 1st and 3rd sections (i've seen some techniques with the 2nd too)
are adjustable in length.  These can quickly and accurately be adjusted by
the practiced player to yield an un-countable infinity of horns.

I can blow a harmonic series to the 8th partial on most of my 15,897 horns.
