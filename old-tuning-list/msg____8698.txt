Subject: WA Mathieu's Harmonic Motion

From: David Beardsley <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

I got this from Amazon.com a few weeks ago. It seems
to be a pratical just intonation ear training course. I didn't
get that far with the book yet, I want to spend a bit of time
with the initial exersizes. I've gotten as far as the 15/8 (M7th)
and 45/32 (+4th).
