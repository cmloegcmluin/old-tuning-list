It's an even more natural result of a load of kids in fields off the
M25 E-ed up to their eyeballs :-)

Sure you can pretend.  Pretend you can't tune your instruments
properly.  That's what Captain Beefheart did.

Actually, pentatonic "blues scales" were covered on the list
not long ago.

Roni Size has got a TX81Z, you know.

There are a load of tunes that already use "ethnic" samples.  I'll
bet a lot of them way off 12-equal.

If any producers out there would like me to score their movies, get in
touch.

What, no takers?  Darn ...

Seriously, movies have such a huge budget you can't expect too much
experimentation, especially as the people who hold the purse strings
aren't going to be big musos.  Now, if an established film composer
were to go microtonal, then we'd be in business.  If the audience
don't realise they're listening to microtonal music, they might
accidentally like it!
