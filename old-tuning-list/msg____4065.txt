Hmm, I think that's not entirely fair. I can't speak for STEIM but I
know Sonology because I've worked there. The Institute of Sonology is
not an independent institute but a department of the Royal Conservatory.
Do you expect a state conservatory to become entrepreneurial? That's not
a matter of attitude. A school's task is education, using tax money for
unsure investments is not. I understand that you would have liked it
otherwise though.
