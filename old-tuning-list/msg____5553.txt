What you've got there is not a major scale.  But a major scale is a major 
scale is a major scale whether a whole tone is  9/8,  10/9,  (5/4)^(1/2),  
2^(1/6),  or something in between.

Or whether the scale is  1/1  9/8  44/35  4/3  3/2  176/105  66/35  2/1.  
This is 11-limit according to at least one definition I've seen (yet another 
terminology problem plaguing this list).  (Actually, I haven't had a chance 
to listen to this one, but all the ratios are within the ranges bounded by 
5-limit JI and 12TET for the corresponding notes.)

The point is, those augmented sixth chord arcana are more important *to 
understanding the music* than are the details of the tuning.  In an era when 
everyone tuned their own way, composers did not specify tuning instructions 
with their music.  That's why you see raging debates about J. S. Bach's 
desires for the WTC.

Rameau, for instance, wrote his Treatise on Harmony when JI was not in use.  
Yet he gave integer ratios for the various intervals - not one, but *two* 
ratios for most of them.  He then went on to say that the (syntonic) comma is 
inaudible and proceeded to ignore the difference in the rest of his 
Treatise.  Later (if I recall correctly) he advocated ET without, presumably, 
any effect on his theories.  It is clear that the ratios themselves were 
merely an explanation for the origin of consonance and dissonance.

Modern players don't play in 12TET *per se*, they play *in tune* with each 
other.  Most of the time that results in 12TET because a piano is being 
used.  But a good choir will experience comma shifts when a capella and if 
string players are playing along with a 1/4CMT harpsichord, they'll match it 
without thinking about it.

The idea was certainly considered earlier, but the persistence of 
non-circulating tunings and of split-key keyboards through the 17th century 
prove that it was not accepted until then.

Your idea of "recognizably diatonic" is interesting, and deserves 
quantification.  As in, "What is the ideal and how far from it can a scale be 
to be recognized as diatonic?"

But treating 3-limit JI and 12TET as variations within the same tuning 
system....  Well, I have the definite impression that most list contributors 
consider them to be fundamentally different.
