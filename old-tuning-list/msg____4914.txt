Ptolemy rejects the 81/64 ditone as a possible melodic (i.e. an interval 
between two adjacent degrees) in his "rational systems", since it is epimeric 
(i.e. not superparticular). The only superparticular melodic approaching this 
magnitude is the 5/4. However, as I've said before, Ptolemy distinguishes 
between the generic pattern arising in singing, and that which players of 
kithara and lyra prefer to follow: namely, the intense diatonic (10/9, 9/8, 
16/15 downwards) in the former case, and the ditonic diatonic (9/8, 9/8, 
256/243) in the latter. However, the 5/4 is only a composite interval made up 
of two melodics in the intense diatonic; it is only available as a melodic in 
the context of the enharmonic tetrachord, and of the few sources we have, 
there appears to be a consensus in favour of 5/4 as the leading ratio, which 
is endorsed by Archytas, Didymus and Ptolemy, although they differ in their 
division of the remaining pyknon. One of the grounds on which Ptolemy 
objected to Archytas's divisions was the retention of 28/27 as the following 
(i.e. lowest) interval in all three genera, a feature which was contrary to 
practice (and thus unacceptable, in the context of Ptolemy, because it is 
evidence of reasoning which has not been submitted to empirical testing). 
Ptolemy also provides us with important evidence for a trend in favour of the 
more tense tetrachords ("more tense" meaning that the mutable inner degrees 
of the tetrachord were tuned higher in relation to the fixed outer degrees), 
since he tells us that his enharmonic and soft chromatic, though constructed 
in accordance with reason, were unfamiliar to experience (by his time), and 
so the intense chromatic is the softest of all the tetrachords featured in 
Ptolemy's careful description of the tunings that were actually used in his 
time (it appears in the tropoi kithara tuning, mixed, of course, with the 
even diatonic).
