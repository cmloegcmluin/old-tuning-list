No. Maybe you have insufficient "files" or "buffers" in CONFIG.SYS.
Or perhaps help.par was somehow corrupted. Try to edit it and see if
there are these lines at the beginning of the file:
! Number of topics:
89
If the number isn't there you get the behaviour you described.
Another possibility, but I think an unlikely one, that you have insufficient
memory. You can also check if the other datafiles were seen by doing
MODE/ALL, this should give all the mode names, CALC 8/7, this should
say "septimal whole tone" at the last line, and SHOW SYNTH should present
the names in synth.par.

The program from above is freeware. You can get it from
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/pc/scala/scala.zip
To install, unpack scala.zip in an empty directory, read the file
read.me and type "scala" to run. Then type "help" or "h" to see which
are the available commands. A small tutorial is included.

The new version 1.1 is coming very soon now.
