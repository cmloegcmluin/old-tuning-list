Very true! Or you could resolve the major third outward to a fifth, as was 
done by Medieval polyphonists working in Pythagorean tuning.

I just added this to my paper as an aside, but it is a good reflection of 
the philosophy of the paper in general. Of course the major mode was not one 
of the favorite modes of the diatonic scale until triadic harmony had been 
in use for some time -- the tritone resolves to the tonic triad only in the 
major and minor modes. My paper is an attempt to find a set of pitches 
which, like the diatonic scale, stands up on a melodic basis alone, but 
leads as naturally to 7-limit harmony and 7-limit tonality, as the diatonic 
scale leads to 5-limit harmony and tonality, and (if you believe Yasser was 
on the right track) as the pentatonic scale leads to 3-limit harmony and 
tonality. The attempt succeeds even though I look no farther than the first 
34 equal temperaments (the solution is found in 22-equal).

This brings me to recount the events of this weekend. Johnny Reinhard, 
Richard Kassell, Adam Silverman, and I met in Manhattan on Saturday for a 
Chinese-Latin lunch. Much enlightening discussion ensued. I spent much of 
the rest of the day with Johnny. His wife is a world-class microtonalist in 
her own right; we brought in her defective Kurzweil K2000 only to find out 
that the model is no longer in production -- it has been superseded by, if I 
recall correctly, the VX-24, which has additional expansion ports or 
something. Anyway, Johnny practically drowned me in bliss with his 
collection of music and written materials. Our dinner discussion over sushi 
found him confirming my view that the melodic properties of the diatonic 
scale are best reflected by Pythagorean intonation, its harmonic properties 
by just intonation, and the integration of the two by temperament (this 
could mean meantone temperament, not necessarily 12-equal). He associates 
these aspects with the left-brain, right-brain, and whole-brain functions, 
respectively. (I may have reversed the first two.)

Gary: I believe you are right in pointing to the tetrachord as the basis of 
the diatonic scale. The reason this favors Pythagorean tuning is that only 
in this tuning does each and every octave species contain two identical 
tetrachords. (The chromatic and enharmonic tetrachords, of course, fail to 
produce a scale with this property). The pentatonic scale and my new scale 
have this property as well. It is worth pointing out, however, that many 
theorists have instead found the basis in a property one might call "maximal 
evenness," or spacing two unequally-sized steps as uniformly as possible 
around the octave. Although this can lead to the diatonic and pentatonic 
scales if 12-tet is presumed (another historical fallacy), it leads to a 
scale in 22-tet that is slightly different from the one that is constructed 
according to "tetrachords." Both scales are so interesting harmonically that 
I have allowed for either derivation in my paper. I do think the 
"tetrachordal" one is superior melodically, though.
