Okay.  "Physically" was obviously the wrong word for me to have used
there.  Of course plenty of physical systems have nonlinearities in them
(I forget which chaos theorist said "talking about non-linear systems is
like talking about non-elephant animals"), and buzzes are a prime
example.

Nevertheless, I remain skeptical about adding sine waves of matching
frequency to eliminate beats.  I haven't worked out all the math of it
yet, but it just doesn't feel to me like it would work out.
