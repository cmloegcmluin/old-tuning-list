Subject: Optimal Integer Ratios for 12et

From: "Benjamin Tubb" <brtubb@cybertron.com>

For those who might be interested, the following info was determined within the
"constraint" of using a divisor of 2048 or less. Its usefullness is in being
able to compare cents to ratios and vice versa for tuning evaluations and
applications in such programs as "Pitch Palette" <http://www.justonic.com>. A
simple BASIC program was used to tackle these optimisations with a "brute
force" approach, inelegant but effective <g>.

Integer Ratio Equivalents to 12et Tunings
within a tolerance of .001 of a Cent:

Cents  Ratio
-----  -----
0000   1/1
 0100   1080/1019
 0200   575/512
 0300   1217/1023
 0400   2580/2047
 0500   1366/1023
 0600   2896/2047
 0700   3068/2047
 0800   813/512
 0900   1721/1023
1000   1825/1024
1100   3867/2048
1200   2/1

Does anyone know what the physical "tolerance" of the human ear is to
pitch/frequency/cents variations with the range of MIDI note (0-127)
frequencies from 8.175 Hz to 12543.853?
