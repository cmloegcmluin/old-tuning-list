From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@CompuServe.COM>

Let me try to answer both of your questions at once. Medieval music theory
for the motion of melodic voices is based upon the assumption that the
scale is pythagorean. Therefore the dorian is going to have a 3/2 fifth at
the interval d - a. A combination of this tuning and the standard rules for
melodic motion leads logically to something like a raga with a distinct
identity for each mode, albeit obligatory ornamentation (like gamakas) must
remain a matter of conjecture. There is simply too little evidence one way
or another, and the difference over time and in different places must have
been enormous (as is true for South Indian music, for example.) Later polyphonic music may or may not require just thirds and comma shifts
to accomodate these, or the whole matter may be rendered moot by a
temperament (i.e. equal on fretted strings, meantone on keyboards). In any
case, a 40/27 on the dorian tonic would only be the consequence of a justhexachord on c (assuming that just hexachords ever were current), but could
be corrected to 3/2 by RE on the hexachord on G. Ancient greek music is another matter altogether. There is no theoreticalevidence one way or another of rules regarding tritone leaps - or of any
rules about melodic motion except for the labeling of certain common
motions. If I recall correctly, however, some of the preserved fragments do
have augmented fourth or diminished fifth leaps. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
