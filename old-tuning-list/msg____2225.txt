The Akai S1000 & S1100 samplers let you access up to 200 different
'programs' at the same time, each consisting of up to 200 'keygroups'. To
each keygroup can be assigned one to four samples, individually tunable (in
cents!), and the same sine wave of 254 samples can be assigned to all of
them - in that case you certainly can't complain about waste of RAM !  I'd
be surprised if other samplers don't offer that facility.

I like my Akai S1100 very much, I think it's a well designed machine that
deserves its popularity. And correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Yamaha's
TX81Z the first microtunable MIDI synth, back in 1987 ?
