	I'm not very kin on Armenian music but indeed very interested.
I checked the New Grove Dictionary, and it doesn't mention "Dudok" 
not even under Armenian music. Maybe somebody can give me some 
bibliography to read more about it.

	I also found this music notated with sharps flats and small "H"
symbols in the key signature. Does anybody know the meaning of this 
last accidental (maybe 1/4 tone sharp???).

	Johnny, sorry about my ignorance, but I didn't understand
what's the meaning of not passing the octave in compass.

```thanks in advance!!!
