Subject: Stretching 88CET

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

The advantages of tempering 88CET up far enough to keep it from being every
third step of 41TET (if there really are any) are more conceptual than anything
else.  

   There are two values in using 88CET itself for what 88CET offers, instead of
setting up your instruments for 41TET and then just using every third step.
1.  You have fewer notes to deal with (e.g. more playable keyboards, 
    fret-separations, and such).  
2.  You establish a conceptual framework for your music that establishes
    9:7s, 11:9s, 7:6s, 7:4s, 10:9s, and such as the basic building 
    blocks, instead of 2:1s, 5:4s, 6:5s, 4:3s, and such.  Forcing 
    yourself to rethink the problem entirely from that perspective, 
    rather than using variants on a traditional set of premises, will 
    almost certainly cause you to produce entirely different music.  
Making it miss the triple octave as well as the double octave may somewhat
enhance that different perspective.
