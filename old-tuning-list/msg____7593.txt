See my previous post about Benade or Backus and Tuvan throat singing.

Hmm, I wish I had a clearer picture of what you're talking about. I
wonder if a double-reed instrument might have some slow phase drift due
to slight inequalities between the two reeds, much like a guitar string
will vibrate at two slighlty different frequencies if the bridge allows
horizontal vibrations to begin at a different point or with different
resistance than vertical vibrations.

Not necessarily. A physical "subharmonic" is not just a sine wave but is
a (weak) true fundamental with any or all (weak) harmonic overtones. In
this case, those overtones would be at 3/2, 5/3, 7/2, . . . the primary
pitch and could conspire to keep the bulk of the waveform intact. (I'm
sure if we knew more about the physics of the situation, this
"conspiracy" would turn out to arise in a very natural way, not one that
requires any "consciousness" on the part of the instrument).
