Subject: Re: Chalmers-Mclaren postings

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Forgive me for responding in everybody's attention to Helmut's question.  But
I suppose it bears repeating, to make sure everybody understands:

   Brian McLaren doesn't believe in phones, so he doesn't have E-mail either.
So as a service, John Chalmers posts messages for Brian.  John doesn't
contribute to or edit Brian's messages, although I think John said that he has
refused to post one or two of them.  

   I suspect that Brian would be delighted to hear your comments, Helmut, on his
postings (he has in the past anyway).  And he has also posted his address for
that purpose:  Brian McLaren;  2462 S.E. Micah Place, Corvallis, OR  97333-1966;
USA.
