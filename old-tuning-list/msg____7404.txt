Was that your point?  If so, I don't think anybody was disputing it.  I
think for most of us the fact that at least a few microtonal works have
made their way into film scores is cause for hope, however slight.

I'm not sure I appreciate my actions being described as desperate--in
terms of the actual work, there's not a whole lot of difference between
film scoring and TV scoring.  And considering that the audience for TV
is even greater than that for movies, I don't see that it's
inappropriate, since this thread began when someone mentioned that film
scores would be a great way to propagate microtonal music to a wider
audience.

BTW, if we consider blues to microtonal (to tie into another thread)
plenty of blues has been used in film and TV scores.  And the music for
NBC's _Third Rock From the Sun_ has lots of pitchbending going on too,
though it's obviously for the weirdness effect rather than anything
systematic.

It's not his job to demand it.  It's the composer's job to provide the
music, and while the director certainly has a lot of say as to what kind
of music he wants, the composer hardly has to wait for the director or
producer to ask for microtonality (or any particular compositional
option) before he can use some.

But that assertion ("there's no way of getting the music onto them")
simply isn't true, which was the whole point of mentioning examples.  It
_is_ true that it's very hard--but "no way" is overstating the case.

Actually, the world's largest movie industry (at least in terms of the
number of films produced) is India's.  Given the classical Indian
tradition of non-12TET, just _imagine_ all the xenharmonic film scores
that are going on over there!
