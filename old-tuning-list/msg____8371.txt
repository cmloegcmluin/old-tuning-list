You got to see P2?  Lucky you -- I doubt any of these Projeckt shows will
be coming to Minneapolis...

I have wondered about Adrian Belew's disc The Guitar as Orchestra -- it is
all MIDI guitar stuff too.  Much of it sounds wildly non-12et, but I wonder
if there is any system to it at all, or just random bending in all
directions.

I have daydreamed about these possibilities as well.  Even more, I would
love to hear the League of Crafty Guitarists playing refretted acoustics.

FYI-  I will report more when completed, but... I now have collected all my
supplies and will be refretting my Stratocaster to 22ET in the near future.
 New parenthood status is (rightfully) monopolizing most of our time at
home, but one of these Saturday afternoons I'll get a few hours free to
hack away.

How are you tuning the strings on your 22ET guitar?
