Subject: Re: MIDI file formats

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl

Here is the MIDI filespec:
http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/midifile

You can do several things:

- Write a program to write a midifile directly.
Then I would advice to look at the source code of existing programs for
examples. Here's one: http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/PROGRAMS/mf2tsrc.zip
The next possibility will be easier.

- Write a program to write a text representation of a midifile that also
inserts pitchbend commands.
Then you can convert it to a midifile with T2MF (I don't know if
that's the same program that Kami mentioned; also in the Scala zip file).
The next possibility will also be easier.

- Write a program to write a text representation of a midifile without
inserting pitchbend commands.
Then convert it to a midifile with TXT2MF and subsequently convert the
midifile to a retuned midifile with Scala inserting the pitchbend
commands. Everything that Scala does, can also be done
noninteractively. You can run it from a .bat file and put the Scala
commands in the startup.cmd file. This also has the advantage that you
can use the same midifile for different tunings.

- Write a program to write a Scala sequence file. This may still be
slightly easier but it gives you less control over the result since
not all midi messages are supported. This is similar to Kami's
xen2txt utility.

- Write a program to write Csound files. Csound also works
noninteractively and gives you much more control over the sound,
better tuning precision and has none of the midi limitations.
It produces soundfiles, not midifiles. This however takes a lot of
computing time so you will have to be patient to hear the results.
