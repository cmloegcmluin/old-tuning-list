Subject: Bartok: Egypt, Magyarorszag, Rumania, Slovakia, Turkey?

From: Jan Haluska <jhaluska@mail.saske.sk>

I write you some facts about B.Bartok  and his work which I obtained from
the Slovak Encyclopaedia. 

Regards,

High Tatra - Slovakia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bela Bartok
~~~~~~~~~~~
* born in Sannicolaul Mare, Romania, 1881 
* about his father I did not find any concrete data. 
* mother - Paula Voit from Martin, Slovakia
* 1888, his father died (BB was 7), 
  BB and his mother moved to Bratislava (the capital of Slovakia)
* 1892-1899 high school in Bratislava (gymnasium, not a musical school); 
  his mother was a piano teacher and and educated BB in the piano play; 
  music theory techers: L.Burger, L.Erkel, A.Hyrtl
* 1899-1903 Academy studies in Budapest, Magyarorszag, 
  teachers: S.Thoman, H.Koessler 
* 1906-1918 collecting folk songs (tunes) in:
  Slovak regions: Gemer 1906, Nitra 1907-11, Hont 1912-14, Hron 1915-17,
  Slovak and Magyar (mixed) region: Rakoskerestur 1918.
  TOTALLY: 
  3409 Slovak songs (tunes) and their variants 
  and about 4000 texts.
* 1920-28 the work over this material. The huge publication entitled
  BB: SLOVAK NATIONAL SONGS I., and II., 
  was published in 1959 and 1969  in Bratislava, Slovakia
* the whole  BB's work (it is evident mainly in the period 1908-1930)
  reflects the Slovak national music songs and culture. It can be seen
  from his musical style, tonalities (e.g. Lydian mode), harmony thinging,
  etc. BB wrote about all this also in his proper theoretical studies and
  papers.
* the most of BB's works (they can be listed in detail) are either
  entitled, dedicated, or otherwise evidently bounded with the Slovak
  territory
* after 1934, BB lives permanently in Budapest, Magyarorszag,
  he asked the Czecho-Slovak  citizenship, which was rejected 
  (I do not know exactly why)
* 1940, emigration to the USA
*  +1945, New York, USA
