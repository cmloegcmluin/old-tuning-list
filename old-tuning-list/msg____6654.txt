Mark Levy: Intonation in North Indian Music, A Select Comparison of
Theories with Contemporary Practice, Biblia Impex Private Limited, New
Delhi 1981

Levy wrote this book as an M.A. thesis under the supervision of Nazir A.
Jairazbhoy, Professor of Music, Univ. of California, Los Angeles. There
is a copy of this at the University of Georgia, Athens. You can probably
secure it by I.L.

 The singers he tested seem to have used 12 pitch classes in the octave,
but I find this very surprising, given the proverbial microtonal
ornamentation that no Indian singer omits for more than a few seconds.

I think after you have seen this reference you will be inclined to
believe that Sarngadeva did indeed think in terms of 22-tone equal
temperament - although of course he certainly would not have thought in
terms of 'temperament'. To the Indian, the srutis are divine, and far
more important than the ratios. We Westerners are Greeks to the core,
you know.

Indian music is one of the most treacherous subjects I know for the
theorist. One can find excellent authority for almost any opinion.
