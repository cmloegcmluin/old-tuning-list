   I agree with Paul here.

   Why look at them?  Because they're interesting.  Historically 12TET came
about as a necessary compromise.  But when you throw open the field to
other numbers of tones per octave, they start becoming interesting for
other reasons.

   That's also a good point.  That, for example, opens you to possibilities
analogous with tritone substitutions.
