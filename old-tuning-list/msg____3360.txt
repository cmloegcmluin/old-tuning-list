Subject: note to Jon Szanto

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Jon, Haverstick here...oops, I just remembered...I did use the word freely
in post 792 to refer to the gift of music being freely given to someone
from the Creator...my personal feeling is that such a gift is not meant
to be hoarded, but shared with all possible...even if they may not under-
stand it. To me, this has nothing to do with any time period such as the
1960's...it is a basic truth by which I operate...thanks for the inter-
esting discussions...Hstick
