Subject: Re: Quadratic Prime Just Intonation

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Paul and others have asked me what I mean by "quadratic prime just 
intonation" and this is now the time.  I used this tuning exclusively in 
a solo trombone work called _Rama_ based on the Arthur C. Clarke & Gentry 
Lee series of books.  I later used it for a section of my string quartet 
_Cosmic Rays_.

Firstly, I'd like to quote a passage of _Rama_ which lead me to the tuning:

"What comes first?  Do we use models to help us find the truth? Or do we 
know the truth first, and then develop the mathematics to explain it?"
- a lead character Nicole les Jardins

Quadratic Primes 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97
Each successive number is computed by increasing the difference from the 
previous number by two, resulting in exactly forty consecutive prome 
dollars.  The sequence of primes ends only when the 41st number in the 
string turns out to be a non-prime, namely 41 X 41 = 1681.

The ratios are:
43/41 = 82 cents
47/43 = 179 cents
53/47 = 193 cents
61/53 = 244 cents
71/61 = 263 cents
83/71 = 271 cents
97/83 = 270 cents
and continues to diminish down to 1681/1601 = 84 cents
 
In the _Rama_ books, the alien sentients that rule their lives use 
quadratic primes as the basis for their computer software.  I found in 
using what at first seem like arcane relationships actually make 
consonance of all possible combinations.  Thats why its just intonation.
