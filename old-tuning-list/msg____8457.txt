Subject: re: partch bio

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Dear Erik,

I've read the bio, both before and after publication. There is no better
way to get a handle on the *life* of Partch, and I doubt that anyone will
be able to supercede Bob's throughness of scholarship. It is, as the title
states, primarily a biography, though Bob understands and goes into musical
matters whenever appropriate. It is *not* a treatise on just intonation.

Buy it if you are interested in Partch. The only other thing I would add it
that it now forms a very nice yin/yang with Philip Blackburn's "Enclosure
Three", which, through it's compilation of Partch's writings, collected
materials, photos, etc., tells the story of Partch's life in an oblique
manner, but no less important.

Both unhesitatingly recommended. You must have more than a Taco Bell job
for the Blackburn book, but the Gilmore tome is reasonable, esp. through
online booksellers like http://www.amazon.com/

Cheers,
Jon
