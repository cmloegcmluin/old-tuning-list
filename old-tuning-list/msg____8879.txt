For the record, I took Judith conrad statements as a humorous support of
my previous post. The Native Americans mentioned might though have
enjoyed hearing there music on the piano in the same absurd way I can
laugh at the version on In C performed by a Chinese Orch. with there
confusion over what semitone they are to play!
    As to the MOS being formalized by Clough is erroneous in that Wilson
work predates the others! See Wilson Archive Below.
