Subject: Scala's new web site

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl

Scala, the tuning program that I wrote, has a web site now:

http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/

It contains a list of features, examples, help text with index,
download info, a list of references, release notes, and some links.
Many thanks to John Pusey for doing design work, hosting of this
web site and giving critical comments.
Maintainers of websites, if you have links to the Scala zipfile please
replace them with a link to the above home page.
