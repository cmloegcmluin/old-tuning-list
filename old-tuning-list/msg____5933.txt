I was interested in the comments of Denny Genovese, and the "World
Harmony Project" he directs.  I visited their site at
http://www.afn.org/~sejic and found these comments: "JUST INTONATION is
a musical term. It is the practice of tuning musical intervals by means
of whole-number ratios of frequencies. This allows the production of
chords and scales which are more resonant and have finer resolution than

those produced in the more common, equal tempered tuning system. This is

the natural tendency of singers, string players and any other musician
who is not bound by the confines of frets or keys that force the use of
non-just intervals. It is therefore the starting place from which all
indigenous musical traditions began." [Italics mine].  I am wondering
whether Denny or any other contributor to this list would be interested
in providing evidence for these last statements, as they apply to all
musicians in all societies at all times, from the beginning of human
(and animal?) history.  Thanks.
