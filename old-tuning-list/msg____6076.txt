Yeah, I'd say that's typical.  As much in the Western world as anywhere else.
 And what a shame!  It was darn well true of me, too, until a few months ago.
 And I have a B. of Mus. degree!  I recently described to my former Dean of
the School of Fine Arts how dramatically my recent study of JI and other
tunings had deepened my understanding and appreciation of music in general,
not to mention greatly refining my ear for pitch.  I asked him why we were
not taught this stuff in school, why I had to wait 10 years after graduation
to stumble upon a real understanding of music.  He had no answer.

My point is, understanding the hows and whys of something provides a stronger
basis for intuitive usage of it.  The two (knowlege and intuition) are not
isolated from each other.  Knowlege is power.  If musicians from all cultures
studied tuning, including the math and science of it, and practiced putting
that knowlege to work, how much better we all would understand our own musics
and those of other cultures!  Not that that's entirely possible, since many
don't have sufficient education in math and science to grasp the mechanisms
involved.  But the more the merrier, I say.
