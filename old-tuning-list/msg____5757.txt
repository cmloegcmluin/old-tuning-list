   Then a guess it comes down to the connotations and denotations of
admittedly vague phrase "about equally".  My main goal was to express that
philosophy of all keys being what you aptly called "usable".  What I was
including in the category of FAILING to be "about equally well in tune" was
of the nature of a meantone wolf fifth.

   I'm personally more interested in tunings that produce much less subtle
pitch deviations from 12TET, like 9:7s, 11:9s, 7:6s, 7:4s, and 11:6s for
example.  So although I have personally experienced the different feelings
that well-temperaments have across various keys, general trends like
gradually getting more exotic as you deviate from C Major I have not
noticed before.  I'll try them out on my ASR-10 in that light.
