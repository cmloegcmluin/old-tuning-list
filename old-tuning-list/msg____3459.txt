Subject: The Partch Religion ?

From: "Enrique Moreno" <eig@ccrma.stanford.edu>

Check it for yourself:

+ There is a Founder, who is the prophet for the Ultimate Truth
+ There is the Ultimate Truth and Ground of all things (namely, Just
Intonation)
+ There are the Disciples and many would-be initiates
+ There is a corpus of Sacred Writings 
+ There is a book containing The Teachings
+ There are the Sacred Relics made by the Founder himself
+ There are ritual meetings to celebrate the Mysteries
+ There are Orthodox, Liberal, and Puritan Theologians
+ There are rival sister religions, and ancient pagan cults
+ There are detractors and persecutions of the faithful
+ There are also heretics who deny either the approved liturgy or the
validity of some crucial dogma
+ There are atheists who don't believe in the Ultimate Ground of all things
(let alone in the Master)
+ Item plus, there are skeptics who think that both believers and
unbelievers are right (or wrong)
+ There are converts and apostates, who have either found or lost their
faith in both the Ultimate Truth or its Prophet
+ There are also sympathizers and curious, who would like to know more
about the Master and the Ultimate Truth of all things
+ There are scientists who despise this religion and call it numerology
+ Item there are other scientists who uphold that this religion and science
are not at odds
+ There are zealots and counter-revolutionaries whose main objective is the
destruction of the hegemony of the 12-tone-equal-temperament, and who will
pragmatically ally with the faithful just to undermine the
12-tone-equal-temperament status quo. 
+ Then there is the great and indifferent World at large, who immerse in
the darkness of 12-tone-equal -temperament doesn't even know about any of
the above (or care to know) 

	There are also real religions ...  :)
