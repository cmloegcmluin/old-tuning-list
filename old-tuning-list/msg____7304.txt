Subject: 88CET Ear-Training CDs, part 5

88CET?  Wuzzat?
---------------

   Before I go into more detail about the sorts of exercises that make
sense on such a CD, I need to explain a bit more about 88CET tuning itself.
Some of the exercises won't make a lot of sense without this background
information.  Indeed, some of the exercises on these 88CET CDs aren't
likely to make much sense on, for example, a 34TET ear-training CD.

   I did a series of tuning-list postings on 88CET tuning about 3 years ago
or so.  Even though it's been that long, I'll paraphrase the qualities of
88CET tuning a lot here, since that's not the main thrust of this series.
I am working on some really killer web pages about 88CET tuning, but
they're only about 1/3 done now.  So in the meantime (not to be confused
with "meantone"!), if you'd like to learn more, I can send any of you who
might be interested in more details about 88CET, the text of those postings
(assuming that I can find them all!).

   Most basically, "88CET" stands for "88-Cent [per step] Equal
Temperament".  It's an equal-temperament whose primitive step size is 88
cents.  The 1200 cents in an octave's span clearly don't divide evenly by
88, so 88CET is a nonoctave tuning.  No two notes on an 88CET instrument
are exactly an octave apart, nor exactly two octaves apart.

   But the fact that it does not approximate octaves is not, in itself,
quite as critically important as several other attributes.  For the
purposes of this series, here's what's most important about 88CET tuning:
1.  88CET has no traditional major or minor thirds.  Instead it
    has three nontraditional thirds:  subminor (7:6), neutral (11:9),
    and supramajor (9:7).
2.  It has no approximation to a traditional major or minor scale.
3.  Since it has no octave, 88CET has no octave-compound intervals.
    That means that, rather than getting "octave-equivalent" intervals
    in each octave's span, you instead get an different set of
    harmonic resources.
4.  88CET has a pretty good approximation to a 4:6:7:9:10:11:15
    harmonic-series fragment chord, or (obviously) any fragment of
    that chord.
5.  Since it's an equal temperament, it can also play that same
    structure inverted, meaning a that same subharmonic-series
    fragment.
6.  Also because it's an equal-temperament, you can build other
    chords as stacks of any one of those intervals, such as a neutral
    triad, which is a stack of two 11:9 neutral thirds.  That in the
    same sense that a major triad is a minor third atop a major third.
7.  Since 88CET has no approximation to the octave, it has two
    intervals that come close to an octave.  They are far enough to
    sound "out of tune", and close enough not to sound like anything
    in their own right.  They are, in short, "off octaves" and I find
    that they pretty much have to be avoided in most forms of harmony
    (for approximately-harmonic timbres that is).
8.  In addition to "off-octaves", 88CET also has a similarly dreadful-
    sounding off twelfth (3:1 ratio), and off double-octave (4:1).
    Other harmonic frequencies (5:1, 6:1, 7:1, etc.) seem to be either
    sufficiently well-represented, or are harmonically remote enough
    to be tolerable.
Again I'm brutally paraphrasing here, so I'm not coming even close to doing
justice to the importance of any of these qualities of 88CET tuning.

   Here is a table of frequency-ratio approximations in 88CET music:
