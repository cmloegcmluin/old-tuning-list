Hmmm, worrying.  Are you detecting my finely tuned wit, or did I
make some more laughable errors in my post?  Hopefully the former.
The problem with, as you put it, "joining the fray," is that I
handle my e-mail offline so I end up replying to the digest before
the one I'm picking up.  Anyway, here goes . . .

If you're tuning a digital synth to an ET scale, all you need to
do is one division, and from then on it's just addition.  This
is easier than all that multiplying of fractions you need to work
with JI -- unless you use ratio space axes.  My point is that
there's no reason why you can't do all your work in a logarithmic
scale, and then an ET is the simplest scale to define.  Most of
the work in microtonality now is done with electronic synthesis
rather than dividiing up strings.

Actually, I probably could calculate an nth root of 2 to a few of
decimal places (which is all you need for practical tuning) using
the Taylor series for (1+x)**n  A first approx to the nth root
of two is 1+0.7/n for 10<n<100.  This is the sum you need for most
sensible nTETs.  I cheated and got the 0.7 from my calculator, but
it can be estimated from the Taylor series. The true inverse
problem would be calculating the logarithms of whole number
ratios, which I could do with pencil and paper fairly easily if I
could remember the logarithms to base two of prime numbers.  In
reality, of course, I would use a spreadsheet for both
calculations.

By the limited experience I've had of playing in alternative
tunings, I have found that ETs do have a common characteristic.
My ear can definitely tell that all the intervals are the same.
Melodically, this makes ET to me more natural than JI.  But,
the effect is to make the scales sound "linear".  Diatonic scales
fitted to 19tet sound great but, once I play all the notes within
a third, in any order, it starts to sound bland.  This means that
the equal tempered nature of a scale is audible, but should be
hidden.  Handel may have got away with it, but he was a better
composer than me!

Once you define a space, the simplest thing you can do is divide
it into equal steps.  If that doesn't work, you can try something
more complicated, but there's no point in adding complexity for
the sake of it.  JI comes from the harmonic series, which is a
quantization of linear frequency space.

To correct my own grammar, I suppose something's either natural or
it isn't. My point is that ET scales _are_ natural.  Of course,
the word "natural" could mean a lot of things.  In this case, in
relation to mathematics, acoustics, human instinct or patterns
found in the natural world.  I think it's the last one you mean,
which is fair enough.

More importantly, though, I disagree with your original statement
which, as you did say, is largely a question of personal taste. A
tuning should be judged primarily by its subjective musical
interest.  By this criterion, just scales score very well. But,
with most music, they can be approximated quite adequately to,
say, 31tet.  This is the usual, but not sole, reason for using
ETs.  If you want to exploit JI with hair splitting accuracy, I
expect you'd have to work with slow, harmonic music with perfectly
harmonic timbres and no vibrato.  Otherwise, go with whatever's
simplest.  On my Wave Blaster, major triads actually sound better
in 31tet than JI.  This  may be because of sample looping (could
someone explain this, please?), phase shifting vibrato or a bug in
my program.
