Danielou is an ethnomusicologist from a less empirical era. Most criticism
of his writings that I have seen focus on the fact that the justifications
for his derivations of scales and tunings are based on his own mystical
precepts and not actual practice. (Danielou denied this, claiming that
modern practice supported his theories, but Mark Levy pretty clearly showed
that this was not the case in his empirical study of North Indian
intonation.)

That in itself doesn't make Danielou's theories worthless or even "wrong."
In many cultures, including historical India, music theory is less about
describing practice than about creating a consistent philosophy of music
showing the relationship of sound to the cosmos. Certainly Danielou fits
better into the latter category, though many of his ideas were his own and
unrelated to those of previous Indian theorists.

Here are some excerpts about how Levy describes and critiques Danielou:

"While Danielou presents a number of mystical and acoustical justifications
for the division of the octave into 22 parts, he formulates his own much
more elaborate expanded system of 66 srutis, by means of which he
interprets the intonation of the modern Indian ragas.

"The author constructs a 'universal harmonic scale' which he believes
contains all intervals used in Chinese, Hindu, Arabic, and ancient Greek
music. [Note: elsewhere Danielou claims that Western music is essentially a
22-tone system that has become 12-tone through the conflation of
enharmonics.]...

"From all these pitches, Danielou chooses 53 which are 'acceptable
harmonically,' eliminating others which in his opinion are
'unacceptable.'...To these 53 pitches Danielou, in succeeding publications,
added 12 more obtained by dividing each disjunction [step sizes larger than
a comma] in half. This results in 65 pitches, or if the octave itself is
included, 66. He states that these are the 66 srutis described by Kohala...

"Danielou's theory contains a number of inconsistencies, and seems
contrived to confirm certain preconceived conclusions....Danielou states
that in his sytem there are only 2 sizes of intervals, a 'comma' of 20
cents and a 'disjunction' of 32 cents....Furthermore, there are numerous
discrepancies between the 53 pitches which Danielou presents in 1943 and
those presented in 1969, which the author again leaves unexplained."

Levy provides a table showing that, since Danielou has defined his
intervals in just intonation, such consistent step sizes are obviously not
found. In fact, Danielou describes step sizes ranging from 19.6 to 29.6 as
being "commas" of 20 cents, and step sizes ranging from 21.5 to 29.6 as
being "disjunctions" of 32 cents.

I should point out, too, that actual tuning ratios are not found in Indian
music theory until the late 17th century, and that it is rare to find two
treatises that agree. Bhatkhande (early 20th century) is the only theorist
Levy mentions who even considers 22TET, though he still does not consider
it representative of actual practice. As Levy considers both North and
South Indian treatises pretty comprehensively (though only North Indian
practice), I am unable to find the source of Gregg Gibson's claim that
22TET is somehow standard in the South.

Danielou's scale is still very interesting, and there is even an instrument
tuned to his 53-tone JI. You can find out more about it and him through the
web site dedicated to him. I don't have the URL handy, but there's a link
off the JI network's links page: http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/other.html
