   I realize that this isn't ultimately all that important, but I may as well
point out that this statement is both exactly correct and exactly incorrect.
The amount of momentum with which you hit a bell (or most any other solid
object) does affect its perceived pitch.  That, however, only to the extent that
how hard and where you strike it affects the relative volumes of the object's
nonharmonic partials.  

   As another aside, how hard you bow or blow a largely-harmonic instrument, can
have fairly significant effects upon the quantitative and qualitative pitch of
the resulting tone.  That is mostly due to imperfect elasticities of strings and
reeds and such.  

   But Brian's statement is still essentially correct;  the size of the hammer
has FAR LESS effect upon the pitches of the partials than the dimensions of the
bell itself.
