Subject: Karl Eitz and Tonwort

From: John Chalmers <jhchalmers@UCSD.Edu>

I did an Altavista search for Eitz and Tonwort and found the following
as a new book at the Eda Kuhn Loeb library at Harvard. If anyone has the
time to peruse it, Nadja Schnetzler (<nadja.schnetzler@brainstore.com>)
would most likely be very grateful and show her gratitude with chocolate
<g>.
