Subject: new to list

From: <kbowman@medar.com>

Greetings, people:

I subscribed to the list about a week ago and have been just
watching (lurking) for the time being. I thought I knew a little
about tuning and it turns out I know VERY little.

I'd like some pointers to web sites, books, articles, etc. that
might get me up to speed on the nomenclature you're using here
as well as the basic premises of JI, experimental tunings, etc.

My interests in tuning are currently recreational. I'm a reed
player by training (clarinets, saxes, flutes) and a self-taught
keyboardist with a collection of synths to play with. I've done
quite a bit of conventional composing and arranging and up to
now have relied on scalar "modes" to convey various "flavors".
I'm also an engineer with a very inquisitive mind.

My exposure to micro-tonal music is limited to some work by
Wendy Carlos (on a Synclavier?) - I don't even recall the name
of the piece. If you could direct me to some representative
recordings, I'd be very grateful.

Thanks in advance,

Kevin Bowman
