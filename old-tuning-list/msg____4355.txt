   This is, I realize, getting a bit off the subject of unusual tunings,
but...

   Almost no patent goes to pending status (awaiting publication, in
essence) without going through a protest phase.  By that I mean that
virtually every patent office in the world will reject virtually every
patent application they receive (usually citing the "unobvious" criterion,
but also sometimes citing "prior art") and then wait for the filer to file
a protest.  Perhaps something on the order of half survive the protest
phase.
