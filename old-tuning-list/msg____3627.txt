Subject: a juxtaposed thread

From: DreamtimeV@aol.com

Im a notorious lurker with a tin ear that has followed this list for a year
or so.  My interest here is the noisier less conventially  aesthetic
approaches to tuning, compositon, dare I say "improvisation", performance,
music instrument invention, computer, hypertexted sound on the web, crackpot
electronics.  So by exposing my self Im sure its probably clear that much of
the mailinglist style banter & theorizing ad naseum holds little interest for
me. What interests me greatly is the interactive medium we have in front of
us to collectively come to new ideas, create new works, lighten the burden of
history & construct a collective musicality that would make Harry Partch sit
up in his gravel & yodel.  (& it would probably take something  utterly
designed with nature & wildness to even get his attention).  

Yesterday I had some of the most fun (& I do desire fun) by following the web
link to a posting here which mysterious led me to a site by David Behrman &
several other including some named IGOR.  Getting to meet those people's
work, even on a cursory level, was much more seductive than having to wade
thru the rhetoric.  Understand that Im not dissing what's going on, Im saying
it would be useful to many many other people who are very interested in
experimenting with alternative tunings, more personally invoked styles of
composition to feel included in this space.

My suggestion is maybe a directory of web pages proactively hyperlinked by
all who come here.  So that we can visit each others life & each others work
in this particular (read peculiar) dimensional virtuality.

I apologize for being so prosaic but even though Ive read thru these things
endlessly, Ive never felt that there was a place for my style & articulation
of musicality. Having quite college eight times, (even got thown out of the
electronic music seminar for throwing paint bombs at the building ways during
a noise ritual), have spent many years painting records & putting my own
labels on them, writing a book about noise as the most unused & neglected
resource on the planet,


I
guess
Im
just
not
qualified
to
carry
on
about
the
mathematics
of
frequency
as
it
relates
to
someone's
subjective
fantasies.
