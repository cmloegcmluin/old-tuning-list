  Musical writing

 Really I don't know if somebody has written no less than one hundred pages
that I think it at least require, If not, this subtitle, as many others,
will require a special research.
The problem is why has the music writed in the staff (pentagram) a
microtonal intention. When does the problem beguin ?  How did it evolute,
and how did somebody use it in the practice of music anywhere ?
The fact is that in each Octave we have 35 note-symbols (and 35 subsequent
note-names) to represent 12.
With one exeption each one of the twelve notes has 3 note-symbols. G sharp-A
bemol has 2.
The 35 notes appertain to pythagorean criteria. But it's hard to believe
that somebody had used this in practice.
When I studied violin I asked about it and the answer was done
theoretically. In practice more or less "go ahead and don't worry" !
The 35 notes are placed in 12 "zones of 3 notes". Being the three notes in a
row of one comma of separation.
All of this is implicit with microtonalism.

There is another matter not conected with microtonalism but with the madhouse.
-- Do you know in how many different manners may the 12 notes be written ?
-----  I counted more than 500 .
