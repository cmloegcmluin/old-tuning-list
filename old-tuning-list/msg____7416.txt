}Schoenberg . . . completely recognized the overtone series as the basis
}for 12ET.

Are you aware of the extreme inconsistencies in this position that
Partch pointed out?

}Partch did Schoenberg one better by explaining the minor
}through an undertone series.

The "undertone" explantion of minor dates back long before Schoenberg.
But Partch scoffed at any reference to "undertones" or the like, calling
them "hallucinations" or worse.

It pains me when such a fine musician plays fast and loose with theory.
Especially a musician who has been so instrumental in educating the
public on tuning.

Respectfully,
