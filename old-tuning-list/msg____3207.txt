Subject: Re: TUNING THE HARMONICA

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@CompuServe.COM>

Welcome aboard the list, Pat!  I don't have many specific suggestions for how
to proceed with the xenharmonica (harhar), but I wanted to comment that you
would probably be a largely unique act.  Speaking for myself at least, I don't
know of anybody having done much with unusual tunings on the harmonica.
Although Partch's Chromelodeon is a retuned reed organ instrument, which is
somewhat similar anyway.
