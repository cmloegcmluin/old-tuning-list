Uh,I think we got our lines crossed again.What I should have said is :
Is the res. of the MR series "good enough" for all practical purposes in 
actual use ? 
Thing is, nice ( & cheap) as software synths are,they don't offer 
much/any instant gratification,and 
the tedium and length of time it would take to put together an hour of 
decent music on those things is indecent,so I'm looking around.

I've been reading through the discussion on Ensoniqs that was going on  
here recently,and I don't
quite get something : You said that  the MR and ASR-X can hold only one 
"global" tuning,does this mean that it can only use one tuning at a time 
on all MIDI channels ? The brochure for the MRs
sates " 1 RAM location for receiving a Pitch Table..." ,I thought this 
meant that each MIDI channel/
"instrument' could have a different tuning.Also,Is there any way to 
switch tunings on an individual channel during performance,perhaps via 
real-time sys-ex ?


I've been crunching some numbers,and it looks as though Yamahas like the 
FB-01,TX-81Z,etc. can get to within 0.1 to 0.2 Hz of pure just intervals 
(the TX-802 seems even better at mostly within 0.1Hz). Can anyone confirm 
? Also,would this resolution be good enough for "educational" purposes ?
