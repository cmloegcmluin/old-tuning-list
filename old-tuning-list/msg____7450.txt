This is somewhat misleading. It is possible to store the Ensoniq 
tuning tables in your computer. I know since I wrote a program 
several years ago to do just this. (Unfortunately, it was on an Atari 
computer, so it will be of limited usefullness to most). Thus - the 
problem is not with the "Ensoniq pitch table sysex codes", but rather 
that the authors of the software did not bother to implement the 
Ensoniq pitch tables. As far as I know, though, you cannot update 
them except by sending a whole pitch table, that is, you cnnot retune 
"one note" at a time. 

Since most of my pieces are in non-12 based tunings, I have found 
the Korg and Roland synths almost useless. The Yamaha's (like the 
TX81Z), the Emu's (like the Proteus modules) and the Ensoniq 
samplers are all roughly equally capable.
