Subject: Re: FWD: Re: Bach's tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Mr. Frosztega represents a modern reincarnation of Mr. Marpaug it would 
seem.  As a legend in his own mind he has deduced what Bach did by his 
interpretations of what happened after Bach.

I believe he confuses Bach's intent in saying why all major thirds are 
sharp, placing them in an ET context, probably because he is in an ET 
context.  Using sophistic argument, trailing inconsequential facts, and 
finally, making acusations of "revisionism" and implying incompetency are 
weak rebuttals for a scholar.

It is the evidence that is presented here that is in question.  The 
tuning instructions for Werckmeister III are explicit: they are based on 
tuning 5ths, with the 4 larger-than-just thirds merely resulting.  The 
Lubeck Marienkirche which contains 2 organs used by Buxtehude kept 2 
organs: the large one in ET, the "kleine" in Werckmeister III...all 
before J.S. Bach, according to church records.  Based on key 
requirements, an organ was chosen, and a Mr. Shoof employs this practice 
today with recent recordings of both Buxtehude and JS Bach.

"Von der Temperatur is 4 pages long and I have a copy...no one said it 
was a book.  It is contained at the end of the translated *Kunst...* and 
appeared earlier in the preface to the fourth collection of Kirnberger's 
*Clavierubungen* (Berlin, 1766) and later in the preface to his 
*Vermischte Musicalien* (Berlin, 1769).

Please calm your distress and keep a more open mind regarding historical 
truths.  Music contains many falsities that have been built upon, amount 
to a proverbial mountain of cards.  I agree that as a performer 
phenomenologically captures the intent of a composer regarding 
interpretation, he or she must try to ascertain the tuning framework that 
the composer, his milieu, and his age supported and/or endorsed.  It is 
not a coincidence that most important works on tuning are as yet 
unavailable in translated languages, including important tracts by 
Zarlino, Fux, and Werckmeister.  At least Kirnberger is available and he 
is not the quack.  He was an accomplished musician with great reverence 
for his "old-fashioned" teach of less than 2 years.  As a theorist he 
participated in the exciting theory debates of Berlin - the major center 
for such discussions for its time.

Face it: there is no evidence that JS Bach favored, or even used ET in 
his earlier works.  And to some ears, his music is quite enriched by 
variegation of keys.

Manuel:

Thanks for keeping this thread going.  Please continue once again to pass 
this to the harpsichord list.
