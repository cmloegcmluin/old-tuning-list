There's an assumtion Gregg makes here that goes to the heart
of his argument, and I hope I won't be accused of carping by
pointing it out.  It is that temperament has something to do
with singing.  Certainly, singers temper intervals.
However, they do not require an explicit system to do so.

Actually, four fifths octave reduce to two major tones.  I
wouldn't be at all surprised if it were possible to sing them
both accurately.  9/8 functions as a melodic consonance, but
this is lost in 19 equal.  However, this is not worth arguing
about.  More to the point, I would not expect the average singer
to produce accurate intervals from an equal temperament.
It is not unreasonable, however, to expect a guitarist to
tune her five strings to five just fifths.  A temperament
that takes this into account does have advantages.

Now, to get to the heart of the matter.  What difference
does it make to a singer if I play a chord sequence on my
keyboard in schismic temperament, comma shifts and all?  I
wouldn't expect any variable pitch instrument to follow
instructions to more precision than 12 pitch classes.  If
the harmony makes sense, it shouldn't be too difficult to
sing in tune with it.  As the commas are well below the
melodic limen, they shouldn't cause any confusion.

Firstly, Gregg, there's a character there that comes out
as a filled in rectangle on my screen.  Can you try keeping
to strict ASCII?

Secondly, I consider myself to be post-modern.

Thirdly, the important point.  No musician before the 1950s
had a digital computer.  Theorists before this date, therefore,
did not need to consider the tuning of an instrument that can
produce a very large number of notes to a high degree of
precision, but that nevertheless requires each pitch to be
specified numerically.  You can bet singers in the 16th century
produced an enormous variety of intervals, but there was neither
a reason to write them all down, nor the ability to do so.
Despite all this, schismic temperament is at least implicit in
medieval Islamic theory, which is where I got the idea from.
So, there's nothing new there.

It is in no way arrogant to say that I have an instrument of
hitherto undreamt of resources.  I intend to use those resources
to the utmost of my abilities, in order to make up for it's
deficiencies relative to an acoustic instrument.  Part of that
means explicitly specifying intervals of less than 50 cents.
Also, using septimal harmony.

The advantages of using meantone (or mesotonic -- a better
word, but I'm not used to it) need not be stated, as anyone
who subscribes to this mailing list must be aware of them.  I
expect most people will tune fixed pitch instruments to such
a temperament, if they wish to play harmonic music, and they
will be missing very little.  That doesn't stop me using any
tuning I feel like using.  I can't be held responsible for a
whole culture.
