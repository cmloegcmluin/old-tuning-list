Don't forget the Buchla MARF, which stood for "Multiple Arbitrary Function
Generator", which allowed for envelopes with any number of breakpoints and
looping control based on real-time input.  The 300 series analog and Touche
and series 400 digital synths used these to great effect.  The ADSR's time
is long past.  It's handy that our envelopes are loopable so you can use an
envelope generator as a parametric-shape LFO.

(forgive the topic drift)
