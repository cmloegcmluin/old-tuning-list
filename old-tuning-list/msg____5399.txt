Subject: Pitch for the International Microtonalist web site

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

With the blessing of Johnny Reinhard, I have just made available a web
site devoted to Pitch for the International Microtonalist at the
following URL:

    http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/pitch/

Pitch is a complete set of reference materials designed to facilitate
independent development in microtonal music.  The site includes an
overview and ordering information, as well as links to other pages:
tables of contents, author index, subject index (forthcoming, maybe),
title index, and errata (forthcoming as soon as folks send me some).
Johnny tells me that Pitch will soon be available through the British
Harry Partch Society.  When that becomes a reality, I will update the
web site accordingly.

Pitch is a publication of the AFMM.  I am not affiliated with Pitch or
the AFMM in any way.  I am providing these web pages as a service to the
xenharmonic community.

John
