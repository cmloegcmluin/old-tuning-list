Psycho-acoustics has told us that our ears have limited pitch resolution, 
and that they develop short-term familiarity with a small set of specific 
pitches and specific melodic intervals. In my opinion, the greater the 
number of consonant harmonies you can make out of a small set of pitches and 
melodic intervals, the better. In this regard non-just tunings definitely 
win out over JI.

Examples:

1. A 7-note diatonic scale in JI has three melodic intervals and five 
consonant triads. In meantone (or 12-, 19-, 31-, 50-tET), it has two melodic 
intervals and six consonant triads.

2. Another example eluded to already is tritone substitution. It is useful 
to have a half-octave, since it can represent 7:5 in some contexts and its 
own inversion, 10:7, in others. Using common tones in a changing context is 
an effective way to move to distant harmonies, but in JI, distant harmonies 
will have at most one common tone. JI of course has no half-octave.

Another way of saying this is that Just Intonation has no "puns", or notes 
taken in two different senses, and typical JI theory does not admit punning. 
However, in creating intervals in JI, you will eventually come across some 
very complicated ratios that are so close to simple ones that they will 
function as consonances rather than dissonances. So the typical JI 
small-integersnsonance / large-integersssonance approach falls flat on 
its face. In ETs, as long as the ET is _consistent_ within the particular 
harmonic limit you are trying to represent, _accurate_ enough to represent 
it, and does not have notes too close to each other (34 is just barely OK in 
this last respect), the dichotomy between consonance and dissonance is 
unambiguous and you have all the benefits of extended harmony enjoyed by JI 
of that harmonic limit (I speak of odd-, not prime-number, limits here).

Ultimately I have to agree that a continuous-pitch paradigm is most 
desirable. However, individual musical ideas within such a paradigm are 
likely to employ simple sets of fixed pitches, and some non-just tuning, 
perhaps even an ET, might be the best way to work out harmonizations and 
developments of a given idea. Combining all the ideas into a single 
composition, however, may require us to demand completely flexible pitch. 
Johnny Reinhard's compositions make this case even where simple-limit 
harmonic considerations are not often dominant.

Here's my point of view: We have several hundred years of Western music in 
12-tET, by, say, 100 great composers. Have the possibilities been exhausted? 
Somewhat. Does the existing repertoire have enough diversity to provide a 
lifetime of listening enjoyment of the most transcendent and sublime sort? 
Many seem to feel that it does. Therefore, even a single new tuning system 
should be enough for a composer to do a lifetime of work and, even if the 
composer is of the first rank, the composer will not exhaust 1% of the 
tuning's resources. Considering the range of expression contained in 12-tET 
music, any single microtonal tuning will, by increasing pitch resources, 
lead to an unimaginable new universe of moods and sensations. The technical 
difficulty of mastering a single new tuning, even a new ET, in the current 
educational environment, is plenty to expect of a composer whose main goal 
is to express himself/herself in a new way.

David, Let's discuss more if you like this topic as much as I.
