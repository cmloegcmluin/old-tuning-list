Subject: Instrument Spectra

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

I have placed in "http://lonestar.texas.net/~mr88cet/tuningStuff/" GIF
files showing the harmonic decomposition of flute, alto saxophone, violin,
and trumpet play notes at or near middle C (262Hz).

   Be sure to start with the flute picture
"http://lonestar.texas.net/~mr88cet/tuningStuff/FluteC262.GIF", since I
drew in some notes on how to interpret the pictures in that one (only).

   It seems apparent to me anyway that, in a very high-level sense, none of
these show especially much more or less total amount of harmonic content
than the others (e.g., the flute being nearly sinusoidal as the common
misconception goes).  What makes all of the difference between the
different instrumental timbres is the detailed differences within those
spectra, and of course their attack-transient characteristics.
