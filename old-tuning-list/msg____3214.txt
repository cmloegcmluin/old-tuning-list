Below are the rest of the articles Jim Murray found for me.

Ralston, James V.; Herman, Louis M. "Perception and generalization of 
frequency contours by a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)."
Journal of Comparative Psychology, 1995 Sep, v109 (n3):268-277.
    
 Abstract: A single adult female bottlenose dolphin was tested in a 
series of perceptual studies. On each trial, 4 sine-wave tones were 
presented that contained a falling frequency contour or some other 
contour. There were several frequency-transposed exemplars of each 
contour type in each experiment. The dolphin discriminated contours 
at a level significantly greater than chance in all experiments. In 
the 1st 2 experiments, the dolphin demonstrated only modest transfer 
to novel stimuli and a sensitivity to the absolute frequency of stimuli. 
In the 3rd experiment, there was no effect of the absolute frequency of 
stimuli; in the 4th experiment, the dolphin successfully transferred the 
discrimination to novel stimuli drawn from the octave above the 
previously heard range. These results demonstrate dolphins' capability 
to perceive frequency contours, which may underlie the recognition of 
conspecific whistles. 

Cynx, Jeffrey. "Auditory frequency generalization and a failure to 
find octave generalization in a songbird, the European starling 
(Sturnus vulgaris)." Journal of Comparative Psychology, 1993 Jun, 
v107 (n2):140-146.

Abstract: Examined frequency generalization in starlings (Sturnus 
vulgaris) that were trained to discriminate between individual 
frequencies. Starlings were tested for frequency generalization after 
training on 2- and 3-tone discriminations. There was no evidence for 
octave generalization, which is a hallmark of human absolute pitch 
perception. This suggests that avian absolute pitch perception must not 
be interpreted as identical with that in humans. A control experiment 
with 1-tone discriminations indicated that the presence of lit response
keys affect the shape of the generalization gradients. Lit response keys 
are a common feature in avian auditory perception experiments, and this 
control experiment cautions that results may be affected by this 
seemingly minor procedural change. 

Hulse, Stewart H.; Humpal, John; Cynx, Jeffrey. "Discrimination and 
generalization of rhythmic and arrhythmic sound patterns by European 
starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)."    Music Perception, 1984 Summer, 
v1 (n4):442-464.

Abstract: Investigated the ability of mature wild-caught European 
starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to process acoustic patterns with 
different, serially organized temporal structures. Four of the 
Subjects were female; 2 were male. Subjects were taught to discriminate 
patterns of 2000-Hz tones organized into rhythmic as compared with 
random, arrhythmic temporal structures, and the perceptual processes 
underlying the discrimination were analyzed. Subjects were required to 
peck at one key in the presence of a rhythmic pattern and at another 
in the presence of an arrhythmic pattern. Results show that all Subjects 
learned to discriminate between rhythmic and arrhythmic patterns and 
that discrimination accuracy was the same for linear and hierarchical 
rhythmic structures. In a series of transfer tests that followed, 
discrimination performance was tested when the temporal structure of 
the rhythmic stimulus patterns was transformed and when the pitch was 
shifted up or down 1 octave. Performance was well-maintained when 
baseline temporal patterns were shifted 1 octave. Results suggest 
that the Subjects solved the rhythmic-arrhythmic discrimination on 
the basis of rhythmicity. 


And now for something completely different, Gamelan tunings on
Roland synths, forwarded from the Gamelan List out of Dartmouth.

Subject: Laras Gamelan in Roland 86

For those who like both the diatonic scales and the gamelan pentatonic
scale.

I just made tune adjustment in one of the program of my Roland 86 to
make the organ usable to play gamelan instruments with the pentatonic
music scales.

The basis of 'laras' gamelan is tone 6 (nem) and 2 (ro) for slendro,
pelog bem and pelog barang.  For scale 6, I use Bb with pitch adjusted
+47 steps higher - most gamelan has more or less laras 6 similar to that
tone.  For scale 2, I use Eb with pitch adjusted +37 steps higher.

Slendro scales:
1 = C# |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F# -33 |  5 = Ab +15 |  6 = Bb +47

Pelog Bem Scales:
1 = D |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F |  5 = A |  6 = Bb +47  ----> 4 = Ab +15

Pelog Barang Scales:
1 = C |  2 = Eb +37 |  3 = F |  5 = A |  6 = Bb +47  ----> 4 = Ab +15

It is obvious that laras gamelan is not a simple break of tones by half
like in a piano (both slendro and pelog).  Please explore and you will
see.  If you have a Roland E86, 'Happy trying !'.

Al: so far so good. But aren't instruments such as peking tuned sharper
than, say, slentem? What to do about that? Some synths, such as the EPS
16+ and Kurzweil 2000, allow overall ['global'] tuning, which I think
you're describing, as well as tuning of individual sounds or
'instruments.'

I assume the steps are tuning units, 1024 to the octave?,  or does
Roland use another system I'll post any reply to Tom Ross's question.
