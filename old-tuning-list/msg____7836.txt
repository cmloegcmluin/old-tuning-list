I think we're touching on something quite important here. 
It seems to me that these two different types of mistuning
sensitivity may relate directly to thinking in terms of equal
temperament or ratios. (This is possibly incorrect, though.)

The fact that a 3/2 is simultaneous more and less sensitive
to mistuning also seems to have something to do with
the fact that, because 3 is the next-strongest prime quality
after the octave (2), it can be both absorbed into the strength
of 2, in which case mistuning is not much of a problem, or
can stand out as a powerful new identity, in which case
mistuning will be very obvious.

I have said before that a basis of my theories is that we
will always try to "break down" any complex situation
into its most easily understood components.  If periodic
frequency vibrations can be understood in terms of
how they divide into 2s and 3s, this is a very easy
comparison for our brains to make, thus even a small
deviation will stand out very noticeably.  The case is
much more complex for, say,  an accurately-tuned 7/4. 
It would not be as easy to notice a deviation from a
ratio with 7 as a factor, simply because 7 is a much
more complex comparison to make than 2, 3, or even 5,
and each higher prime is correspondingly more complex.
