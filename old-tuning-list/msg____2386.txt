Subject: Chalmers' Constant and a
 family of constants giving rise to
 yet another non-just non-equal-tempered
  scale
---
As John Chalmers has pointed out, the
iterated absolute log function produces
a set of unpredictable numbers unless it
starts with a certain number.
In that case, the series enters a fixed point.
If the function is called the mclaren series,
clearly this constant should be named 
Chalmers' Constant.  It lies between 
0.399012979 and 0.399012978.
This constant is different for each 
logarithmic base.  Thus a family of
constants is implied.  For base e,
the constant lies between 0.567143289
and 0.567143291.  For other bases,
the constant is different.
This implies in turn an infinite number
of non-just non-equal-tempered scales.
One could, for example, generate one
such scale from the constants for the
logarithmic bases of the primes:
C[1] = fixed point for iterated log base 3
C[2] = fixed point for iterated log base 5
C[3] = fixed point for iterated log base 7
C[4] = fixed point for iterated log base11
C[5] = fixed point for iterated log base 13
C[6] = fixed point for iterated log base 17
C[7] = fixed point for iterated log base 19
C[8] = fixed point for iterated log base 23
and so on.
Another scale could be generated by
taking
C[1] = fixed point for iterated log base pi
C[2] = fixed point for iterated log base e
C[3] = fixed point for iterated log base F
C[4] = fixed point for iterated log base L
C[5] = fixed point for iterated log base C
C[6] = fixed point for iterated log base G
and so on, where F is Feigenbaum's
constant, L is the first Liouville number,
C is Chapernowne's number, G is the
Euler gamma constant, and so on.
As musical intervals all these values
appear to be particularly intractable
from a just intonation point of view;
large rational fractions are needed to
approximate virtually all of them.  Clearly
these musical intervals do not fit into
the just scheme of things.
