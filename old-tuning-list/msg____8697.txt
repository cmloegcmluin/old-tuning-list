Subject: quick reviews of recent concerts...

From: David Beardsley <xouoxno@virtulink.com>

It's been a month and I still didn't get around to posting a
review of the Deep Listening Band & the Long String Instrument.
Of course nobody else did either...

Set up in Columbia U.'s Low Library Rotunda, the LSI is 100 feet long.
Attached to the walls with a resonator box at the opposite end,
the 13 limit (that's right!) LSI still had to be amplified. Two long
droning instrumentals from the CD Suspended Music (Periplum P0010 )
were performed, Epigraphs in the Time of AIDS by Pauline Oliveros and
TexasTravelTexture by Ellen Fullman.

The Long String Instrument is just that: 175 long wire strings played
in just intonation by Ellen Fullman, Jessica Lurie and Matthew Sperry.
As
they move along the instrument, they "bow" the strings with rosin
sticky hands. Numbered lines on the floor are reference marks for the
performers to play the strings. At times the LSI sounds a bit
like an accordion as well as bowed strings.

The Deep Listening Band has been around for a few years in different
combinations. Usually DLB are: Pauline Oliveros (accordion in just
intonation, conch, voice, electronics), Stuart Dempster (trombone,
didjeridu, conch, garden hose, voice, electronics) and now David
Gamper (overtone flutes, ocarina, electronics). They spent the concert
making little noises into the Expanded Instrument System, a local
area network of Macintosh computers and high end Lexicon DSP.

Stuart Dempster performed JDBBBDJ on a large brass didjeridu,
the audience was encouraged to sing along to the massive drone.

DJ Spooky managed to horn his way in to the program with
a *remix* of previously released DLB & Oliveros recordings
that he accompanied on an electric upright bass. Effectively
destroying whatever meditative mood that was established for the
evening, on the third night he actually performed this set with
the DLB.
