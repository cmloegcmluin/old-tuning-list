See the references in my paper
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf (ignore p. 20, it's all
wrong). Other authors who have given essentially the same 5-prime-limit
ratios, which, as Joe Monzo pointed out, probably resulted from a chain
of 21 3:2s with the schismas ignored, include Mathieu (_The Harmonic
Experience_) and Wilkinson (_Tuning In_). I've seen it elsewhere too.

I would be _most_ interested to learn more about this.
