I am pleased to see that Cage's works before 1951 have not been
overlooked. I presume that Johnny included "Sonatas and Interludes" as
microtonal for the same reasons as I would. I find the charm of the
timbres in some of the more reflective and melodious of the "Sonatas and
Interludes" is in the beatings that occur in some of the sounds. They
sound out-of-tune in a really nice way. 

There are probably two reasons why Cage's prepared piano work has rarely
been considered microtonal : one is that the most obvious surface feature
of the music is its rhythm;  the other is that the 'tuning' is not
systematic. 

The prepared piano was an ingenious and musical way of breaking free of a
notational system developed for writing in 12-TET. I suppose they've never
gained Cage the reputation as a microtonal composer because the method of
inventing the timbres - with their quirky tunings - is not as systematic
as some would like. Indeed the timbres are often the invention of the
performer and not the composer. Hence, it is easy to discredit Cage's
contribution by making something monumental out of his later philosophical
statements at the expense of these earlier works.

I'd love to hear what Brian has to say about the "Three Dances for two
Amplified Prepared Pianos". Every performance I have heard of that work -
live and recorded - has left me breathless. I can't say the same for works
post 1951.

Thanks for the information on the later works.
