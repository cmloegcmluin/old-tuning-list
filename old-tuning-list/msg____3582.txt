My point exactly. That is, they *do not* use pitch class theory in their
compositions.  Thanks for the reconfirmation

Magnus often uses a synthesis of techniques derived from spectral theory
and pitch class theory.  Nevertheless, he still thinks primarily in terms
of harmony and harmonic colour.

Certainly, but during my studies with Tristan he refered often to the objet
sonore.

Sure, IRCAM has often been a political hot potato. Still, to say, as
Mclaren did, that IRCAM has (musically) nearly marginilized *itself* out of
existence is not true.
