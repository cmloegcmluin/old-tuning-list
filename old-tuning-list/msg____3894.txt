Subject: Short Report: ICCMMS '96, Shanghai, China

From: linusliu@HK.Super.NET (Linus Liu)

The following is a short report on my visit at the ICCMMS 96
held in Shanghai, China, 15 to 19 October.

I shall not repeat what is found on the initial submission form.
The chief host of this conference in Computer Music and Music
Science, the Jiao Tong University, is celebrating its 100th year
anniversary. The city Shanghai is rapidly being modernised. One
delegate has heard it said that 40% of all cranes in the world
are working in Shanghai. Another delegate described the traffic
there, a "well organised chaos". Most felt by overseas delegates
is the hospitality of the organisers, one expressed in the
closing ceremony, "a hospitality that (he) has never found in
any conference before, probably never  in any other." The
country's mystic evaporate. I pay my share of thanks  to Prof.
Xu and all involved, even I myself felt more like a host than a
guest.

The splendour of this old international city is still evident
and fresh as ever by the river bank. While a new developed city
shoots up over the other side of the river bank, marked by the
tallest (in the world?) TV transmission tower, and numerous new
buildings all less than five years old. Old reserved sites and
buildings over Shanghai are well maintained. Taxi price is
cheap, and looking around on ourselves with a map is  possible.
Unfortunately, admission mostly begins at six and closes at
five. We could peep through the gates of places.

Accommodation for overseas delegates is given in a small but
nice hotel just across the road at the University main entrance.
The first day conference was held at the University main hall,
the next two days at the conference room at a newly built (2
years?) exhibition complex, and an exhibition of Dunhuang (on
Silk Road) Arts was on.

The delegates were entertained with a few nice, big dinners
(maybe fifteen courses. Words fail. You need to be there
eating.), a concert at the Shanghai  Music Conservatory with
electronic music, Mendelsohn violin concerto  (1st mvt), opera
solo except and Chinese instrumental music, performed by
Conservatory students. An evening of a traditional Chinese
opera. Some  looking and shopping around the city, of course.

Most delegates from overseas stayed after the conference for a 3-day
tour to Hangchou, the most scenic and cultural city and ancient
capital of olden emperors. One probably cannot see all the many
interesting places in three months time. At times we scattered,
and we the more adventurous found and tasted a few more of the
most famous and excellent local dishes.  Silk was cheap, our
Italian friend bought ten neck-ties.

Paper presentation is scheduled within three days. One paper is
read at  any one time, so basically, everyone hears every paper.
The respective  categories of MUSIC SCIENCE, 28 papers, COMPUTER
MUSIC, 18  and GENERAL 8 papers.

A modest 18 papers came from overseas incl. USA, Japan, Italy,
Hong Kong, Ireland, Scotland. Visitors at the August Hong Kong
ICMA might have found it difficult to attend the Shanghai
conference just two months apart. For many Chinese delegates,
this is their first and valuable experience at an international
gathering. Inclusion of "Music Science" in the subject of this
conference has permitted many more Chinese participation.

My own paper on "western" vs. "Chinese" tuning practice was well
received, in particular, among our Japanese friends, with an
invitation to visit Japan  extended to me. Michael Land composes
music for computer games, and he was cheated by my recorded midi
example of an orchestral excerpt from the  Beethoven violin
concerto and took it as real orchestra. He was so impressed  and
wanted to apply my technique into his music (if his boss would
support it).

I hope many of you will consider coming to China for visit. It
sure is a place one cannot afford to miss.
