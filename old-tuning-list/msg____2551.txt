Subject: Paul Fly's 88CET Music

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I had the pleasure of receiving a tape from Paul Fly a few days ago.  The
first side was in 88CET, and the second was in 12TET.  

   Lemme tellya, I was thoroughly impressed!  As with when Bill Sethares and
Warren Burt did 88CET compositions, I learned a LOT from hearing Paul's approach
to it.  Perhaps others will as well.  The best way I can describe it
stylistically doesn't do it justice, but I would say that it has qualites of
Wendy Carlos, Jean-Michel Jarre, and perhaps Laurie Anderson.  Of the three,
it's probably most like Jean-Michel Jarre, but like I said, that comparison
alone doesn't do it justice.  

   To me, it was probably especially interesting texturally and in terms of the
overall sound (mood) that the tuning gave it.  It was perhaps a little less
interesting melodically or formally.  But most of it has a marvelously catchy
and reasonably innovative underlying "beat".  

   Timbrally speaking, it mostly concentrates on electronic sounds.  I heard
what sounded to my ears to be sounds of analog, sampling, and a probably a bit
of FM synthesis.  The more distictive sounds to my ears were analog-sounding
(notably resonant filter sweeps and such).  

   Timbrally- and, to a slightly lesser degree, stylistically-speaking, there's
a fair amount of variety in this music.  But I especially the variety of
textures and beats in it.  

   I didn't hear much to complain about in it, and a lot to enjoy.  Probably the
only thing I would view as a little weak is the structure and form.  As any one
piece completes, it's sometimes a little difficult to think back about the
journey it put you on.  But, in my eyes, that's only a moderate concern at
worst, and not a concern at all at best.  

   Good work, Paul!  Perhaps you could be so kind as to post your address for
others who might want to hear it?  (And for me too, since I seem to have lost it
somehow!)
