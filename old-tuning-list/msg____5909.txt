Subject: More Tape Swap Stuff

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

Chris Smith asked whether or not those who actually did not contribute a piece
of music to the Tape Swap could get a tape if they sent me a blank and return
postage. I was really afraid of this question but I figure I'll do it this
way.

For all of those who absolutely have nothing to contribute but absolutely want
the tape, do this - e-mail me privately 1st and ask me if I'm not completely
innundated by requests and if I'm not then - sure! I'd be happy to make up
tapes for those not producing music. In fact, in a way, those not tied to
their own theories or music often times are the most open listeners and we all
could benefit from their ears, I think. So sure, go ahead and request and I
will try to accomodate those people as well as I can. But I must ask that
those requests come after all the contributing tapes are in, which should be
in about one month. This will allow me to see how many tapes I actually have
to deal with.

I've gotten some very positive feedback on this and that makes me happy. I
think this will be reasonably successful. In any case, once again....

Please send your cassette tape, blank tape and Self-addressed Stamped Envelope
