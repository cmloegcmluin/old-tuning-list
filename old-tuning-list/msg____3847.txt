Subject: All Sides Sit At Table; Peace At Hand...

As Paul Turner confirmed, he meant no denigration of live players/playing,
which is what I suspected anyhow.  No harm, no foul.

Couldn't agree more, and I would have been sunk long ago in my compositional
development (hah! such as it is...) without the wonderful tools available to
us now.  Whether used as a mock-up for future live performance or as a
creative avenue itself, we are having and eating cake.

Hard to say, but then I'm relatively new here. As to my comments about the
plethora of numeric data recently, Gary Morrison responded:

The latter point is undeniable, yet one would assume that the purpose of a
specialized community like the tuning list is to have an environment to
discuss issues of a more narrow focus.  My only point (and this is where I
am at a disadvantage for my short tenure on the list) is that *all* of the
discussion is in the service of creating some sort of musical output, or at
least a sonic field of dreams, is it not?  I am guessing that the various
forms of tuning aren't being explored simply for how they come out in a
spreadsheet but for their current/eventual use in a musical context, and
what I had not seen represented here, in healthy proportion to the datum,
was the *end result* of these investigations.

But then, I am new, and maybe have missed listings of the works composed by
the parties involved.  In any event, we're done, and the notation wars are
clammering for fresh cannon fodder.

Of which I will lurk blissfully on the sidelines.

Cheers,
Jon
