Allen (of the West Coast Contingency) guessed the Partch trivia question 
correctly!  Betty Freeman was (is) a major supporter of both Harry Partch 
and Kronos Quartet.  The connection, to add a third spoke, is even closer 
to Ben Johnston:  Harry introduced Johnston to Freeman (it would be 
confusing to say "Ben to Betty"), if I remember correctly, at a party in 
1950 with Darius Milhaud--what would prove to be a very important party 
for Ben; it's too bad that Ms. Freeman didn't take photos.  That most 
likely closes the circle between Harry, Betty F., and Ben J.

Good work, Allen.  I'm sorry we missed each other in February.  I made it 
to San Jose, though.
