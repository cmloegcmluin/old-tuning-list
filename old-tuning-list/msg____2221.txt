   I've owned many Ensoniq products, and am sold on them.  But those statements
strike me as a little surprising.  I have found over the years that:
* Ensoniq NOW builds reliable products.  One of their former dealers here in
  Austin said that they had big problems with mechanical integrity, expecially
  on the road.  But that's very definitely in the past now.  My ASR-10 has got 
  to be one of the heaviest machines in its class, and I treasure every pound 
  in its steel case!  
* Ensoniq's machines NOW sound great.  That's probably true ever since the 
  EPS 16+.  The original EPS I had could produce some fairly natural sounding 
  instrument timbres, but it was noisy.  It was at least an order magnitude 
  quieter than the Mirage that preceded it, but it could have been better.  My
  ASR-10 though is very quiet, and the sounds it can produce really excellent
  sounds.
* Ensoniq's technology has always struck me as right up there with the best.  
  As far as I know, they were the first to produce an affordable sampler, the
  first to provide polyphonic aftertouch in an affordable sampler, the first to
  provide complete tuning tables in a sampler, and, if behind at all, then not
  much behind in providing effects processors in a sampler.  When it comes to
  bang for the buck at any point on the technology-per-time scale, it seems 
  like Ensoniq has always been an excellent choice.
* People have in the past complained about their documentation and support being
  skimpy.  That too is all in the past if you ask me.  The documentation for my
  ASR-10 I have found to be voluminous, easy to read, well-indexed, and usable
  both as a tutorial and as a reference.  It has lots of clear illustrations,
  meaningful examples, and makes it easy to find little tips and short-cuts
  that aren't obvious from experimentation.  Also the IQ of their technical
  support staff seems to have risen about 20 points in the past five years, and
  they seem to have a few more open phone lines as well.
