Subject: In no defense whatsoever of that Cage fellow....

From: gtaylor@goat.heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

John Chalmers has reminded me again that perhaps
I am a trifle more circumspect than is really necessary
in soliciting recordings of list members for broadcast.
I suspect that my recent TUNING digest life as a
staunch defender of those Black Copter ridin' atonal
mind control brigades (stop laughing, you lot) may have
somewhat obscured my other partial existence as the host
for heading onto a decade of a program of late 20th C. music
on the Madison Pacifica affiliate. While I don't really program
much of *anything* with any regularity (given the range
of what's possible, one tries for some balance), it would
actually be nice to have some wider range of non12TET to
choose from [not that there's not chance for improvement,
as I'm just realizing as I type this (visions of segues and all
that). You might get somewhat of an idea by heading over to
browse at

http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/RTQE.html

which will show you a year's worth of playlists. Why, that
naughty person who patiently attempts to disabuse Brian of
his Cageian delusions Eric Lyon (whose recent disc of
electroacoustic music "Red Velvet" positively *shreds*, by
the way) appeared only last week! If all goes well, I think that
our mutual cyberacquaintance Bill Sethares may well be paying
us an extended visit and playing his music after the Fall fund
drive. So, join your pals Mr. Polansky and Stevie Curtin and
Ted Mook and Bill Sethares and send me some stuff to corrupt
my audience with! Of course, you may wind up segued with
(gasp) Petie Boulez or (shudder) DJ Spooky [or do you say,
Basquiat?], but hey. The only music that I don't play on the
air is my own. If you're interested, let's take it to email
(gtaylor@msn.fullfeed.com works better than this address).

With regards,
Gregory Taylor

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
