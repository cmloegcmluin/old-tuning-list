From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Neil, I think you got it right. Here's a group of people who are jealously 
guarding Partch's instruments, so that no one else may play them, but if 
anyone tries to play Partch's music anyway, they get branded as criminals by 
this same group. Something's disastrously wrong here.

Bach did not approve of the pianos that existed in his time, but think how 
valuable his music has been for centuries of piano-based composers! It is a 
remarkable disservice to the future of xenharmonic music to keep Partch's 
work so narrowly confined.
