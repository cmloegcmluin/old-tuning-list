When I say that the septimals are dissonant, I do not mean to imply that
I hate them. They can be quite charming, when used as dissonances. The
only dissonances that I hate are those so near to the consonances that
they sound like, and are, mistuned consonances.

You might enjoy trying the close approximation to the 25:18 interval of
the 19-tone equal (the augmented fourth). This interval sounds intensely
laid-back and weirdly cool - even more than the 7:5.

No one can go far wrong by trusting his own ears, provided he lives in
fear of his audience.
