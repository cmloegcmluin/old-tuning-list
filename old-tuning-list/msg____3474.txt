Subject: A small plate of crow

From: Bruce Campbell <CAMPBEB@cesmtp.ccf.org>

In Tuning Digest 815 I used a recording of Partch's Yankee Doodle
Fantasy (Johnny Reinhard conducting the AFMM Ensemble) as an
example of why I was wary of synthesizer substitutions for HP's
instruments.  After giving it another look and listen, I think I owe Johnny an
apology.  It looks like he gave it more care and attention than I gave him
credit for.  The DX7 attack sounds nothing like a chromelodeon's but I
can't lay my dislike of the piece at that door.  If it's a case of
misrepresentation at all it looks like it's Harry misrepresenting his own
better efforts, if that makes any sense at all.  Sorry I went off
half-cocked.
