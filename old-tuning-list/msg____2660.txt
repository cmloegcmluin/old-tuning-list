Subject: Who's Who in the Tuning discussions

From: "Jeude, James" <JeudeJ@dbisna.com>

I'm delighted to run across the Tuning list.  Twenty years ago in High 
School I ran experiments in 7-tone scales (simple 7th root of 2) and later 
discovered Huygens-Fokker and have continued my interest in the subject.

I watch the list discussions with an amateur's admiration for the 
professionals but have never had an occasion to contribute any worthwhile 
comments.

However, I see many of the comments come from a small group of dedicated 
participants.  I'd like to ask the participants to contribute a short 
biography of themselves to help new list readers understand their 
background.  Perhaps this could be included in a FAQ for newcomers.

Items I'd like to see in a bio include academic background; professional 
occupation; performance or organizing group affiliations, if any; personal 
studio setup, if any, including description of computer, software, and 
synthesizer/keyboard to facilitate microtonal performance; what traditional 
instruments they play; what microtonal instruments, if any, they  own or 
play; and any special area of interest in microtonal
tuning.
