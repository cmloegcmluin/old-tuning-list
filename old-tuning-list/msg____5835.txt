Of course, the other instrument that if fairly stable in tuning is the
organ.  If pipes are 'dead-cut' to 'correct'length,(which was not uncommon
in earlier times, and not uncommon now amongst better builders) then it is
possilbe to get a fair idea of the builders ideas about tuning.  In fact,
a lot of the info about tuning does come from organs, especially organs in
poor areas, where the resources were not available to 'up-date' the organ
to the latest fancy.
