For the violin family this is true as the vibrato is a frequency deviation
down from the principle frequency (i.e., a backwards rocking of the wrist
and finger).  However, vibrato is an upwards freq. shift on rock&roll
fretted guitar technique (string bend up) (BTW:  also on fretted sitar),
so the low freq. boundary is the aural reference as principle.

Like many aspects of theoretical consideration, the physical performance
practice determines much of the 'reality' by default.
