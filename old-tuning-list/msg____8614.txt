The original title of the Danielou book is "Introduction to the study of
musical scales". Pretty much identical to the reprint. Please bear in mind
the following points.

According to people I've spoken to at the Indian Cultural Centre here in
London, Danielou's ratios are divergent from actual tuning practice and are
definitely not accepted by Classical Indian musicians

>From a Just Intonation point of view his analysis is a five limit system.
Which he justifies in the following way:

	"The number 5 "humanizes" music. It makes it the instrument of the
expression no longer of abstract prototypes but of a tangible reality. The
introduction of any higher prime number would take us beyond this reality
into dangerous regions which are not within the scope of our normal
perceptions and understanding. 7 is the number of the heavenly worlds as
well as that of the infernal regions, and we have usually no means of
knowing to which side it may lead us
	The intervals which contain the element 7 cannot be physically pleasant,
being, by definition, beyond the limits of physical harmony; their magical
effect also is normally beyond our control. Consequently, their utilization
in music and its theory serves no useful purpose." (Introduction to Musical
Scales p231)

Strange prejudice that against a prime number. Still I suppose it would be
interesting to hear if any JI enthusiasts have suffered any metaphysical
nasties through delving beyond the five limit. Personally I haven't.

Otherwise an excellent and stimulating book.
