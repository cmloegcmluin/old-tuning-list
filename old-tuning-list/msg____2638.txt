Subject: Paradoxical tones and circular scales

From: thierry.rochebois@ief-paris-sud.fr (Thierry Rochebois)

A circular scale consists in a set of spectra with defined tonal
pitch (ie notes) and steady spectral envelope.

So, when you play a melody like CDEFABC, the last C is the same as the first!

you can find further information on my Web page at:

(select paradoxical sounds)
There's also the schematics for a paradoxical tone generator!
