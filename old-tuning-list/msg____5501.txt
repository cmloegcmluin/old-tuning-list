   Thanks.

   That's an interesting distinction that I hadn't really thought about
before, or at least not as such.  I that saying that 19TET and third-comma
meantone are identical would be a necessary limitation, in the sense that
our ears' pitch resolution is coarse enough that the difference between the
two is pointlessly small.  And then there are limitations we can place on a
tuning system simply as a matter of convenience, or because it makes for an
interesting compositional environment.
