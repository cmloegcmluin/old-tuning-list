Get a good, rounded steel bar to play with.  A standard technique for lap
steel is to slant the bar to get notes at two different frets.  This doesn't
work well unless you have a properly shaped bar.  Most music stores carry
the Ernie Ball bar, which is adequate.

Some bar slants can actually get properly tuned notes at 3 different frets,
but more often the intonation of those slants is bad.  Choose triad slants
very carefully - remember that the frets are not equally spaced!

You're very welcome.  I'm a bit of a steel evangelist, and I see the
microtonal crowd as a great new market for the instrument.  There are
currently about 20,000 steel players in the world, but I'd bet that those
doing classical and experimental music number less than 100.  I know of less
than 10.

Partch's "surrogate kithara" is a steel guitar of sorts, but it is not
played well in any of Partch's music.  If Patch had paid any attention to
standard steel guitar techniques of his time, his string sounds could have
been every bit as spactacular as his percussion.  Instead, he ended up with
sound effects where there could have been legitimate string music (only my
opinion, of course).

People interested in classical steel guitar should pick up Mike Perlowin's
"Firebird Suite" CD.  While Mike usually plays in 12 tone ET, his choice of
material is nonetheless an exciting development in the steel guitar world.
He tells me that he has a Partch project on the horizon.  I only hope that
he doesn't try to duplicate those miserable kithara parts!
