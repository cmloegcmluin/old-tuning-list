Subject: pitch bend

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

What an overwhelming response to my pitch bend query!  Of course, I know 
about the user table, and to send the bend before note on; it still 
doesn't work in legato passages.  I don't understand why a sysex tuning 
table command can change all of the pitches instantly, but the pitch bend 
control takes so much time (it makes my string quartet sound like a 
jaw-harp quartet). I can only guess that this 
is built in for people who want to hear the gliss, and not for people who 
simply want to set the bend at a microtonal level. By the way, I also 
tried setting my bend capability in the Proteus at an octave, so that I 
would change pitches only by a couple hundred units rather than a couple 
thousand.  This didn't work well either.
