   I suppose that depends on how "true" they want their equal-temperament to be.
Almost no implementation of equal-temperament or any other tuning can ever be
absolutely 100% exact.  

   Best I can tell, pianos have historically been tuned by techniques that owe
their heritage to the old harpsichord tuning techniques, to which they added
somewhat stretched octaves toward the upper range of the instrument.  Still, I
would say that, for purposes of practical music, pianos have been tuned to equal
temperament nearly since their conception.  

   But anyway, perhaps Jorgensen is refering to the increased use of electronic
tuners in recent times?
