I think it is fair to say that Harry Partch's _Genesis of a Music_, for
all its inconsistencies, forms a common grounding for a great many of us
on this list in our discussions. By the way, I intend to model Partch's
"one-footed bride" with a sort of octave-equivalent harmonic entropy
function; that is, rather than using a Farey series (or a series such as
used by Mann where the sum of numerator and denominator does not exceed
a certain limit), using instead the ratios up to a given Partch limit
("odd limit", that is, the largest odd factor of either the numerator or
denominator does not exceed a certain limit). Instead of letting the
order of the Farey series approach infinity, I will let the odd limit
approach infinity, and I expect that for some realistic assumption about
pitch resolution, the one-footed bride will emerge.
