Subject: introducing a ml from japan

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <f1279605@nv.aif.or.jp>

Hi!
hope this one won't be off topic

BUYO-BUYO-IGOR has started a bit weird mailing-list.
Topics it talk over are vague but ... well, 'creating algorithmic
music via www' has a top priority.
People who has something to do with electronic-music, csound or max
things, algo-composings, gran-synth things, alternate-tunings,
improvisation, 'living in Japan' things, strange international
language creation....are all welcome.

NOWHERE is NOW HERE !!
JOIN in THE "nowheremusic" mailing-list
http://www.dtinet.or.jp/~buyobuyo/nowhere.html

1. Are you one of those "gaijins" or "kikokushijos" living in Japan?
2. Are you Japanese but learning any foreign language?
3. Do you play(create) music?
4. Interested in co-creating music via www?
5. Feel positive about the word "Public Domain Music"?
6. Like to experiment mixing up several languages?
7. Are you a cute&curious cyber-girl?
