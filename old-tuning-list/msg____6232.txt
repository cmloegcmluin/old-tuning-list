Subject: Re: What Is Microtonal Music?

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

To the cause of intellectual rigor, or phenomenologically, to the things
themselves!

Out-of-tune amateurity, or pure pitch error, is something I experince with
kids.  In the world of professional music, musicians are admirable in
their abilities to shape pitch.  In my corner of the world we work with
many different tunings and may have more athletic ears than most.

My "yardstick" and the one I encourage is 1200ET.  Wilful misunderstanding
aside, what I hope to express is that there is more exactitude this way
than with any other model I know.  Between any 2 points on a 1200 point
line there is a musical interval which can be made sensible through
repetition.

I have no cultural bias as to which intervals are microtonal and which are
not.  And I realize it is quite a leap of the imagination to bracket your
existence with 12ET and see things in more of a unified theory of
intervals.

For detail, Jon Szanto and others can ask for a copy of Phenomenology and
Its Application to Microtonal Music, or borrow it from a friend.  E-mail
is not the easiest medium for such a topic.

The AFMM is what it is: a forum for non-12ET musics from a myriad of both
tunings and styles.  And yes, I do consider 12ET microtonal.  I hope that
Jon can handle that this is my philosophy -- shared by other prominent
microtonalists -- and can finally get some sleep. :)

p.s. Jon, what does the drummer of Pink Floyd have to do with the repeated
5/4 major thirds on _The Final Cut_?
