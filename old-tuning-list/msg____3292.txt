hi there,

your experience sounds similar to mine!

i've been composing both in 12ET and 19TET for a while.  i always have to
go through a short adjustment period ( a few minutes) when i go from one to the
other.  today, i did a (non-rigorous) experiment where i took a 19TET piece,
and forced my office mate to listen to it for a few times.  at first, she shook
her head and said "this just sounds so out of tune to me", but after about 5 or
6 listens, she said "oh...hey...this is falling into place".  then, i had her
play her favorite CD (a 12TET piece), and she just "tripped".  it took her a
few listens to get back into 12TET mode.  at this point, my non-microtonalist
friend became convinced about how arbitrary tuning systems are.

i don't have a biliography for this.  ;-)

my opinion is that it will take a while for people to get into alternate
tunings on a global scale...the hardest part is to convince them to listen to
new pieces many times.  i'm pretty optimistic though.
