Subject: Re: tuning dictionary

From: John Starrett <jstarret@math.cudenver.edu>

All-
	Although someone may already have such a thing (I have not seen one),
I am compiling an online hyperlinked microtonal dictionary, and would 
appreciate help from any who would like to contribute. The plan is this:
I am compiling as many entries as I can myself, and will accept any 
improvements over my definitions and any new definitions you may wish to 
provide. 
	The dictionary is written in LaTex and is meant to be viewed 
with the IBM Techexplorer plugin (freeware at 
http://www.software.ibm.com/enetwork/techexplorer/). I have chosen this 
course so that fractions, radicals and other mathematical 
symbols can be easily represented, as well as .gif, .jpg and .bmp files. 
(Also, it conforms to the knot theory and nonstandard analysis 
dictionaries I am compiling). 
	I will accept submissions in any form, text files, LaTex files, 
Word, Word Perfect, etc. I will add typeset mathematical symbols for you 
if you don't know Latex.
	I hope this is not a duplicated effort, as it appears that the 
folks at the Sonic Arts Gallery are starting an ambitious web resource. 
Please stop me if someone is already on the project. 

BTW, our computer has been acting up and I may have missed some email, so 
if any list members on the Forum CD have sent me their addresses for 
inclusion on my page of Real Audio Forum CD excerpts and I haven't posted 
your address yet, it is because I haven't received the request. Please 
repost if I missed you.
