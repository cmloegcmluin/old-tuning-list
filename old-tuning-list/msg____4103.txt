Hello, Paul!

Thanks for your fast response. Let me answer at this spot to those
questions which may be of more general interest. (More e-mail will come
separately).

1.) Yes, I discussed overtone structure in my original papers.  I find
overtones much less important under harmonic aspects than 
combination tones. Thus I share your and Enrique Moreno's view that the
use of square waves is not essential for the "Bohlen-Pierce-scale".
Overtones are naturally the salt in the soup as far as the specific sound
of an instrument or a voice is concerned.

2.) With regard to subsets of the scale: Unlike Pierce's obviously
preferred subscale 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 12 (13), I defined two "diatonic"
scales, a "Delta" scale 0 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 12 (13) and a "Gamma" scale 0 1
3 4 6 7 8 10 12 (13). I like the "Gamma" best, but that is a personal view.

Talk to you later, Heinz.
