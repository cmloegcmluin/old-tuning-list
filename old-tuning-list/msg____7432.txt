Subject: Reference on alternate tunings

From: "Ed & Alita Morrison" <essaim@texas.net>

Several people have asked for citable references on alternate tunings when
writing graduate papers.  Take a look at "Tuning the Historical
Temperaments by Ear" by Owen Jorgensen; The Northern Michigan University
Press; Marquette, MI, 49855; 1977; Printed in the USA; The Book Concern,
Inc., Hancock, MI 49930.  This book describes a colossal number oftunings
used throughout the centuries.  The book is interesting even for those
browsing to find new and interesting ideas to develop and use.  ALITA
