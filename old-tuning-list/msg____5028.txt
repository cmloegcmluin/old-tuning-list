Agreed that there are multiple cosmic influences and we don't in all
cases know which ones are insignificant and which ones aren't.

Wrong!

Our brains have a variety of different frequencies depending on
conditions, but it is now recognised that theses frequencies are related
to the Schumann resonance.  Also, experiments show when we are subjected
to ELF (extra low frequency) waves which are a little slower or faster
than the typical Schumann resonance frequency our reaction times are
either slowed or speeded up.  Also, strong natural 3 Hz ELF waves have
been shown to correlate strongly with accidents (confirming that our
reactions are too slow).  So you see, our brains can be entrained by
natural ELF waves near the normal brain frequencies.

When a chord is played in a key then there is also present in our brains
a frequency which is the HCF (highest common factor) of the notes
played.  This frequency will often be in the ELF range and will
generally match either the key or the subdominant.

So you see, given that both e/m and sound can entrain the brain, it is
quite possible that our brains would also feel whether these two
frequencies are in tune.

I accept the previous comments about the variations in natural
frequencies and so it is necessary to say that there is no hard and fast
absolute rule but the relationships at a moment in time will be
important.
