There are current versions of JICalc 4.2 at ella.mills.edu in
/ccm/tuning/software/mac.  You can anonymous FTP there.

There's a program I picked up from the net a while back called gram.exe.
If displays FFTs of signals in color given an input WAV file.  You may be
able to derive pitch and loudness from that but there's nothing specific in
it that does this.  I can't remember where I got it but the info box says to
send comments or questions to rshorne@delphi.com.  Sound Forge also has a
new spectral analysis plugin.
