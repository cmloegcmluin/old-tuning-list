   That's not terribly likely for three reasons:
1.  This note is in the lower register of the bass clarinet.  It is not an
    overtone.  The register key is not down.
2.  If you look at the wave earlier in time, you see that the alternating
    low-high of that rough slowly starts alternating the other direction, and
    in about the same amount of time starts alternating the other way.  There's
    something going on that isn't at a subharmonic frequency.
3.  Once again, if it were a component at half the fundamental frequency, we
    would have seen the entire wave ooze up and down with that trough.

   Analogously, one thing I've done on my orchestral string samples is to
sample and loop the sound of bowing the bridge, and then high-pass filter
it out in the original sample.  That way the pitch of that noise component
doesn't change in pitch with the change in pitch of the tone, just as it
does not on a the real instruments.
