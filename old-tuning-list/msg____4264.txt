This is somewhat akin to the way in which Klarenz Barlough uses his
_Autobus_ programs. For Barlowe, **tonality** is a function or set of
functions whose parametric values can be set as desired by the composer; in
other words, you can turn the tonality on, up, down, or off. (The
simularity between this approach and the recent **principles and
parameters** approach of Chomsky is obvious; remarkably, Charles Seeger,
Cowells teacher - and Cage and Harrison's grandteacher - in his article on
_Dissonant Counterpoint_ (in _Modern Music_ca 1930), proposed a similar
usage of alternative parameter values in species counterpoint).

This contrasts with the traditional function of **tonality** which was to
structure a piece over time (although Gary alludes to this as **coming
back**). Functional harmonic analysis used exact returns over an (implicit
or explicit) tuning lattice to describe this structure, Schenker proposed a
model based upon linear diminutions of a single source chord (the Major
triad). 

(Various **extensions** to **tonality** could be mentioned: increased
chordal density, altered chords, the Skyriabinist school, where a static
source chord is used both harmonically and melodically, Stravinsky's
playing off of diatonic and octotonic materials, or his dialectically
playful use of tonal **mistakes**; none of these, however, presents a
challenge to the essential mechanisms of **tonality** per se.)

Alternatives to **tonality** as an organizing principle include the
Schoenberg-Babbitt model of pitch class and aggregate (extended by Babbitt
to several levels and to other acoustical parameters) consumption, Carter's
exhaustive use of  interval controls (which I believe were discovered by
Lou Harrison), Xenakis' set structure in _Herma_ (La Monte Young uses a
strikingly similar set organization - albeit sets with rational
relationships - in TWTP; Yuji Takahashi, indebted to both Xenakis and
Young, has also made interesting music - in Just intonation - using set
structures), Stockhausen's diminutions of motives (or, as he calls them:
formulas), and Boulez´s multiplications of a motive to create larger
structures. None of these approaches, however, has really found an enduring
following.

In contrast stands John Cage, who, partially following Varese's attempt to
integrate noises, proposed the divorce of a works division into temporal
units from a unique definition of those units by tonal means. It is perhaps
very difficult today to imagine how radical this suggestion was. Until very
recently in the western world (and still true in many places), the academic
study of music was largely identical with the study of functional harmony. 
>From our present perspective - being able to splice in some **tonality**
with a sequencer, or turning the **tonality** on or off like a thermostat
with an algorithm, and the entire disjunctive tonal experience offered in
the media - Cage's proposal seems a commonplace. Even Cage's leading
European antagonist, Luigi Nono, while objecting to the use of
indeterminacy and chance operations as compositional abdication, used
composerly brute force to fill his large-scale forms with materials,
including tonal allusions or fragments, unrelated by functional tonal
schemes. In short, and in this regard, we have all become Cagians.
