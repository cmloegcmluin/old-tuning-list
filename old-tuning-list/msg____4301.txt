I have noted that, while F# major triads do occur in baroque music, they
are often of short duration.  A favorite example is in the big Organ
Prelude and Fugue in D.  In the Prelude, the second section (dotted
rhythms) there is a cadence on F# major which is notated as an eighth note
followed by a pause.  Immediately following is a sweep to a HUGE D major
triad (very bright in well-tempered systems!), followed by a glorious Alla
Breve.  I am sure that the 'wimpiness' of the F# cadence creates a greater
contrast to the glorious D major.  This difference does not exist, of
course, in equal temperament.

I have also noted examples of this in Scarlatti sonatas.
