Everyone? Wow, I thought I was the only one! (I did see a few in
Experimental Musical Instruments once). Considering the amount of
electric Arabic pop music I hear these days, I suspect there are a lot
more 24-tet guitars than 22-tet. Actually, I did inspire a guy (Steven
Rezsutek) on this list to refret his guitar to 22-tet, after he
independently came up with a lot of the same ideas as I did.

Let's say you're trying to play a 4:5:6:7 chord. In cents this is 0 386
702 969. In 24-tet, you'd start with 0 400 700. If you used 1000 (as in
12-tet) for the top note, your 7:6 would be 33 cents out-of-tune. If you
used 950, your 7:5 would be 33 cents out-of-tune. Both are pretty bad.
In 22-tet, using 0 382 709 982 has a maximum error of 17 cents (in the
7:5). That's about the same as the maximum error of a triad in 12-tet
(16 cents). Not too bad! (The same goes for 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4).

Another reason I like 22-tet is certain scales it contains. The
pentatonic scale is a nice source for 3-limit harmony and is OK in 7-tet
but almost perfect in 12-tet. The meantone diatonic scale is a nice
source for 5-limit harmony and is OK in 12-tet but better in 19, 31, or
50-tet. I discovered/invented some nice scales for 7-limit harmony and
their optimal tuning is very close to a subset of 22-tet.

I agree! That's why I'm more interested in 22-tet than 19, 31, or
50-tet.

Whoops! I lost your train of thought.
