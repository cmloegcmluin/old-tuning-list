Subject: reply - B. Flavell brass tuning

From: Rick Sanford <76122.2237@compuserve.com>

Hi Bill:

Are you using Kurzweils for the brass sounds?  My thoughts are
registral - since there are such timbral differences
(tuba, euphon, tromb, picc tpt, etc.)  I would think
different sized gaps in different registers, sort of like
the old MEL scale.  Maybe close steps (but whole integer) up high, 
then wide (but inharmonic) steps down low to open up multiple
series.  That's what I'd want to try.

Maybe Yamahas would be best for this sort of thing, if you're using
MIDI.  How many octave pitch range do you work in?
