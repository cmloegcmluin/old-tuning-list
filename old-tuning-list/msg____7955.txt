Subject: Eric Stanley microtonal CD available

From: "jloffink" <jloffink@pdq.net>

I received an email from Eric Stanley saying his microtonal CD, "25
Studies, Opus 1," is available for $10 from:

Eric Stanley
44 Tenney Rd
Westford, MA 01886

He uses Yamaha FM synthesizers and 12TET, 19TET, Kirnberger's well tempered
scale and quartertones.  I've described it as complex computer music
sometimes reminiscent of Conlon Nancarrow, and other times of Frank Zappa's
electronic works.
