Subject: Re: The magnificient senventh...

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

There's a spot in early in my off-the-shelf 88CET demo tape where I play the
sound of a diminished triad implemented as 6:5 atop a 6:5, compared to a 7:6
atop a 6:5, the latter case of course being the upper three notes of a 4:5:6:7
dominant seventh chord.  As soon as I play the 5:6:7, I say "you'll immediately
hear that this chord isn't quite as tense as the first chord".  

   What's curious is that as I rehear this periodically (to cut copies for my
various victims), I occasionally have to rethink that sentence.  Basically it's
true, but in a different sense, it's actually more tense.  It's actually more
dissonant (however little that word may mean for a single isolated chord).  I
can't clearly isolate much less describe that sense in which it's actually more
harmonically tense.  Maybe somebody else out there may know what I mean and can
describe it.  

   I do find though that that particular sense reduces when I add the root of
the 4:5:6:7 chord, so be sure to comment on it first with respect to the 5:6:7
without the 4.
