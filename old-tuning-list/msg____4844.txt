Subject: more mystical talk

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

David Malkin's post was a hoot, and it's nice to know that some folks are 
getting into this line of thought for a minute or two. However, until I 
read what Dave said about equating immutable laws with security, it never 
occured to me to actually DO that. I don't feel like there's much 
security in a quest for ultimate values because I am in awe of this 
Universe in a really deep way, and I feel that there are many many levels 
of experience ahead before any "security" is reached. No, I actually like 
the feeling of NOT knowing something, which is exactly why I like new and 
challenging music, and why microdoodling bores the pee out of me. So, 
security is not my conception of ultimate realities; I enjoy the search, 
and the discoveries too.

As far as the comma/wandering tonics comments and dialogue, I couldn't 
agree more that such phenomenon are exactly why I like the concept of 
"just" intonation. In 34 tone eq, you have a comma because of two 
separate circles of 5ths; I see this as a challenge to be used musically, 
because it's THERE; I also like the concept of 2 whole tones, or 
whatever...the more the merrier....which is probably why the "minimalist" 
just intonation movement is not my cup of tea. I like to kick myself 
along the musical path, and the study of tunings has lead to some pretty 
profound concepts about life itself, which is exactly the way it should 
be, I feel. That's exactly why "fascist" and repressive governments send 
great artists to the steppes if they don't behave; they know that the 
artist is the one who sees through their nonsense, and can effectively 
start riots with their art, if they wish. The movie "Amadeus" has a great 
scene or two in it about such things.
I hope we continue, on this forum, to relate any and all theories to the 
ultimate test; namely, is there some killer music being created with all 
our chatter, or is it only words to make our grey matter itch a bit. I 
believe we, as creative artists, do have a responsibility to do something 
beautiful and healing...that's exactly what this Earth needs now. So, my 
search is about expressing greater truths through my music, and working 
with all others who feel iot's important as well...I hope that includes 
many of my tuning bros (and sis's) on this forum (come to think of it, 
how come there's so few posts from women on this forum...any female 
"lurkers" out there?). Hstick
