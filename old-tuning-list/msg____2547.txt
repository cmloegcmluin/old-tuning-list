Subject: RE: historical?

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Perhaps Ed Foote would be interested in this disc:

Seventeenth Century French Harpsichord Music, played by 
Edward Parmentier, Wildboar 8502.
Wildboar, 2430 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA 94704 <musoff@ix.netcom.com>

It is an outstanding CD with music of Couperin, Froberger, de
Chambonnie`res and d'Anglebert. It's all played in the rather
radical 1/3-comma meantone (some people say meaner-than-meantone)
but it works well for the music. In combination with a minor key
the character is very heavy and dark though. But the Sarabande in
Froberger's Suite in c sounds very beautiful in it.
I don't know if this temperament is preferable for music in minor 
or major key. Can one decide that in general?

What are the characteristics of the DeMorgan Temperament you 
mentioned? What are the cents values or how is it tuned?
