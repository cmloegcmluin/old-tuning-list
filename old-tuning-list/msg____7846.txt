First off, here's the original statement I made [Monzo, TD 1415]:

I posted to TD 1418 a quote from Ben Johnston which describes
how we prefer melodic intervals to be more-or-less equal.  My
point was that powers of 2 (which is how we calculate equal-
tempered scales) only have _harmonic_  significance in that
they represent or approximate ratios with higher prime factors.

Agreed.  The intonational vehicle one chooses certainly has a
determining influence on the music one creates, but I don't think
it has anything to do with quality -- that's a function of the musician's
talent.  Difficulty of playing is determined more by instrument
construction than by anything else -- if your axe is set up to give
you perfect ratios or perfect 12-eq steps, that's basically what
you'll get (excluding variations caused by bending, lipping,
understanding, research, etc.)

The Johnston article describes four different types of scalar
order, and each one is more complex to understand than the last.
The mechanism for comparing equal intervals is #3, and that for
JI is #4.

This is _EXACTLY_  the point I've been making about Schoenberg.
He stuck with 12-eq because JI opened up a world of possibilities
that he felt was just too vast to deal with on a practical level,
resulting in his compromise of accepting the use of all 12 tones
in the 12-eq scale as representing ratios thru a 13-limit.

As noted above, "easy" referred to a conceptual aspect of
intonation and not to any "real world" instrumental application.

In the old days, they might cite the number of planets (ancient
Greeks) or sides on a cube (Zarlino)...

The reasons are as varied as people's personalities are
different,  _as long as they are aware that there is a choice_!!!

I'm glad you qualified this with "often".  I've heard this so many
times I think I'll puke the next time. 

It's true that JI will bring out modal qualities well, as JI pieces
are usually "Monophonic" in Partch's sense.  That is, all
pitches in the pieces have a tendency to centralize one
specific reference pitch as an overall "tonic", while ETs
give the same chord/ interval patterns over and over again
on all their degrees, making  _exactly transposable_  chord
changes possible.

But as your qualification indicates, this is not always the case.
Much of the theoretical literature on JI is centuries (or even
millennia) old, and does not take into account the intonational
flexibility that we moderns have available to us.  It is possible
today to write music in JI that has all of the transposable,
modulatable stuff that ETs have.  In fact, it's always been
available to good a cappella singers.

This is very similar to the viewpoint I'm coming around to regarding
the ability of Delta Blues musicians to play around with subtle
JI pitch inflections over a 12-eq foundation.

Agreed.  One single listen to the complete set of Easley Blackwood's
"Microtonal Etudes", one each in an ET from 13-eq to 24-eq,
 demonstrates quickly that each ET has a definite mood.

 My personal opinion is that this is due at least in part to the
closeness
with which each of these various ETs approximates ratios of various
prime factors -- in keeping with my belief that each prime factor
has its own unique effect/ affect.  Various ETs approximate different
prime factors well or badly (12-eq is good for 3, OK for 5, mediocre
for 7, terrible for 11.  24-eq, on the other hand, is great for 11).

That's the most important thing.

I've learned it -- it  *is*  harder than snot to play.

"Purely" here certainly means "Just".

I posted this a few weeks ago [Monzo, TD 1403:]

But the fact that 12-eq (or any ET) is a  _closed_  system,
where cycles of intervals return to their origin, was of
fundamental importance in jazz from the 1940s to the 1960s.
"Giant Steps" may not even be possible in a just system, because
it is based on a cyclical interval pattern which keeps returning
to its origin.

(BTW, I'd love to hear your 19-eq version -- it's one of my
favorite tunes).
