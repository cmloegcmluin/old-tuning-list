I'll second that, and add that (having been present in the flesh for *both* of
the tutorials) they were both models of erudition and that particular variety
of "the soft answer that turneth away wrath" that pretty much guaranteed a
serious hearing. One of the gentlemen in the auditorium seated behind me seems
to have found John's presentation of lattices of interest in the sense that
he'd
probably discovered that some of the things he loves about serial composition
and some of his skills as a table traverser might actually map somehow onto this
strange and new territory. The results will be quite different, but I'm
perfectly
happy to watch folks discover *any* path into working in the space.

I've also gotta say that I heard enough of an excerpt of Kraig Grady's
recent disc
of Anaphorian music [where they reduplicate for stress?] to be *very* impressed.
Our own Eric Lyon's electroacoustic decentrefest "Red Velvet" was a major
shredding
experience. Let's see - I also discovered that ffitch and myself probably
attended the
very same screenings of Rocky Horror in Salt Lake City in the 70s [tiny
world], and
Larry Polansky was his usual beatific and sane presence. My only regret is
that I
wound up at the Teaware Museum instead of finding out about the Linus Liu
goodwill
tour of instrument shops. Bill Sethares' bitchin' green erhu case is (as
the kids say)
*da bomb.*

And one other thing - can you *believe* this? There were actually pieces
played in
the *concerts* in non12TET. The composers weren't clubbed to death by those
representatives of Yurrupean High Modernism in attendance, either. There was
certainly a number of "usual suspects" pieces as well - don't get me wrong.
But it
*is* changing, so I believe that things are looking up for a non12TET stealth
recruitment program. This is particularly auspicious owing to the fact that the
next ICMC is in Thessaloniki, in the bosom of those tetrachordal folks. I'm
sorely
tempted to turn away from my Indonesianisms and to take a run at channelling a
hiphop-flavored Archytus zoned for Light Industrial myself.

And Bill Sethares? In terms of papers, he's one of the *major* meme generators.
I kept hearing about the tutorial from other folks who wanted to know if
I'd gone.
Definitely executive timbre.

With regards,
Gregory

paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
