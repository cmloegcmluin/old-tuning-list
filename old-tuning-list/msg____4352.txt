Subject: Copyrighted/patented scales

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Pat Missin's example of harmonica tunings shows exactly where the
distinction between what is patentable and what is not might reasonably be.

An arrangement of _notes_ on the instrument is patentable for keyboard
instruments and for instruments where individual _notes_ are produced by
individual keys, switches, or blowholes (as in the harmonica). These
layouts or arrangements are clearly invented, much like a mapmaking
technique is invented and protectable as an invention.

On the other hand, the tuning itself (i.e. what frequencies are assigned to
particular notes) is ''common cultural property'' and not patentable. (To
repeat my mapmaking analogy, the tuning is analogous to the territory being
mapped, and a territory is not patentable, the recent - and deeply mistaken
- awards of patents on genes to the contrary).

An example: if I decide that the best possible arrangement of harmonica
reeds in a diatonic harmonica is .... and no one has thought it up and
sought protection before me, then I may patent the _arrangement_ of reeds.
If however, I wish also to define the tuning of the reeds as, for example,
seven pitches out of 31TET, this _tuning_ will not be patentable.
