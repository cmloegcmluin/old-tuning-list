John referred to cpsxpch, not cpspch. Here's what it says in the 3.44
release notes:

b) Tuning Opcodes (John Fitch)

                icps    cps2pch         ipch, iequal
                icps    cpsxpch         ipch, iequal, irepeat, ibase

Converts a pitch-class notation into cycles-per-second for equal
divisions of the octave (for cps2pch) or for equal divisions of any
interval.  There is a restriction of no more than 100 equal divisions.

INITIALISATION

ipch    - Input number of the form 8ve.pc, indicating an `octave' and
          which note in the octave.

iequal  - if positive, the number of equal intervals into which the
          `octave' is divided.  Must be less than or equal to 100.
          if negative is the number of a table of frequency multipliers

irepeat - Number indicating the interval which is the `octave'.  The
          integer 2 corresponds to octave divisions, 3 to a twelveth,
          4 is two octaves, and so on.  This need not be an integer,
          but must be positive.

ibase   - The frequency which corresponds to pitch 0.0


It is possible to accomplish the same thing without cpsxpch or cps2pch.
Here's an example for 7-TET, since you asked about 7 tones to the octave:

    instr    1
ioct      int(p5)                   ; the octave
ipchclass 100*frac(p5)              ; the pitch class # (00-07)
ifreq     cpsoct(ioct+ipchclass/7)  ; covert it to oct format
..                                   ; go on to use ifreq as normal

If you want a fixed but not equally tempered scale, then you can store the
factors in a table and use a negative iequal parameter in cps2pch:

f   1   0   16   -2   1.000000   1.066667   1.125000   1.200000   1.250000
1.333333   1.406250   1.500000   1.600000   1.666667   1.777778   1.875000

    instr    1
ifreq   cps2pch   p5,-1
...

This table will give you 5-limit just intonation for a 12-tone scale.

To effect more general just intonation, Lydia Ayers posted an example some
months ago of how to send the fundamental, numerator, denominator, and
octave to the instrument as p-fields. This way you don't have to mess with
pitch class notation at all.

Best of luck.
