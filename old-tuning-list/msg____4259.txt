   I'm not sure if this will necessarily help much, but again, that gets back to
how you deal with comma (dieses, skhismas, and whatever 36:35 is called;  I
can't recall the name) errors arising from common tones.  I know of three main
possibilities:
1.  Suspend them unchanged into the next chord, risking the possibility that
    they'll be wolf tones.  I believe that's what Denny Genovese usually does.
2.  Shift their pitch when the competing note sounds.  That's Dave Hill's, and
    apparently Justonic's approach.  
3.  Let the tonic wander.  That's the approach I find most interesting, 
    although I can imagine value in all of the three of them used judiciously.

   It would be neat if they'd allow all three as an algorithmic-composition-like
harmonization parameter.
