Subject: Correction re my use of word "key"

From: Ascend11@aol.com

I appreciate Paul Erlich's correction re my statement that
music in eight contiguous major keys could be played in
quarter comma mean tone temperament.  What I meant was
that that tuning has eight good triads starting on Eb and 
continuing by fifths through Bb, F, C, G, D, A, and E.  It has
eight good minor triads starting on C and continuing by
fifths through G, D, A, E, B, F#, and C#.  It has two quite
consonant seventh chords Eb G Bb C# and Bb D F G#.  The 
just tuning scheme has just major triads on Eb, Bb, and F 
and on G, D, and A.  It has just minor triads on G, D, and A 
and on B, F#, and C#.  Thanks for  pointing this out, Paul.
