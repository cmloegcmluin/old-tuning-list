No. Firstly, I consider Bach a Baroque composer, and secondly, I was not 
referring to equal temperament in particular, but 12-note tunings which have 
large major thirds and small minor thirds in general. These tunings came 
into being as a result of convenience but carry with them a certain quality 
that is not shared by other diatonic tunings, such as those with 19 notes. 
My impression is that Mozart dealt with large major thirds and small minor 
thirds from the beginning, and I believe that circumstance to have 
influenced his compositional choices to a considerable extent. Same goes for 
Chopin, a "Romantic" keyboard composer.
