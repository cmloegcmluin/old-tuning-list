Oops, sorry.  Hmm, I thought "dithering" meant the ongoing cumulation of
roundoff errors when iterating a process involving non-small-integer
ratios to avoid larger errors by the end--the standard example being a
loop to draw, pixel by pixel, a straight line between two random
cartesian points.  That's what I was told when _I_ took CG, anyway.

In what way does the following sentence (from my previous post) not
cover it?
