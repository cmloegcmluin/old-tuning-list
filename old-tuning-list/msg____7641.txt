Subject: Buzz again

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

The reason I am bugged about Buzz and his intonation system is, as 
Paul E. surmised, because I want to drop the other shoe and talk about 
tunings overall, not just 12eq. I do a lot of freelance work, and most 
all of it is in 12 eq...I have a Cort Flying V electric that stays "in 
tune" incredibly...if I don't touch it for a month, I barely have to tune 
it. My Pimentel classic guitar is also a marvelous axe, and is much more 
"in tune" than most other gut strings I hear. Thus, I am quite aware of 
the desirability of a 12 tone guitar being "in tune"...but, I also know 
that these axes are in tune with the sound of 12 eq, not the pure 
intervals. For Feiten to devise a system that helps working musicians 
sound better on a gig, I have only good feelings...again, though, I 
personally feel it's time that the music world begins to understand what 
12 eq is, how and why it came into being, and that there are other 
options. Unfortunately, the magazine editors that I am in contact with 
seem uninterested in pursuing the subject...and that does piss me off, 
because they make it seem like 12eq is IT, and it surely is only one 
tuning out of zillions...Hstick
