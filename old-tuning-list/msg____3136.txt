   Uhmmm...  Perhaps mean "undertones" rather than subharmonics?  If the "note
is itself a harmonic", then the statement is inherently true by definition,
since harmonics of subharmonics are subharmonics of harmonics.  

   But anyway, I can't recall if I mentioned this before, but it's worth
pointing out that it's conceptually possible to get a nonsubharmonic undertone,
such as when a third-harmonic tone on a flute (for example), also sounds a quiet
second-harmonic undertone.  

   As I was fine-tuning the pitch-detection part of my harmonic analysis
program, it was latching onto subharmonics frequently at first.  Some of them I
found to be a result of what I suppose could be lumped into the category of
phase-jitter, or a generalization of the ol' Nyquist problem.  When a multiple
of the period of the tone was close enough to an integer number of samples and
the period itself was not, the math created what I guess could be called a
"numerical illusion" of a nonexistent undertone.  

   But without a doubt, many of them were very obviously and audibly real.  In
many cases, they were even easily visible on the oscilloscopic waveform.  I
can't recall for certain whether any of the nonsubharmonic cases were ever found
to be real, but from what I recall of the exercise, I'd be more surprised if not
than if so.  

   And also, the real undertones were present in far more tones across the pitch
ranges of the gamut of orchestral instruments, than they were not present in.
