Thanks for the Roederer reference, I've always enjoyed it for those with
an older edition the quote is on p.28. So the results of this experiment
never vary from person to person. Is it possible that all people
undergoing this experiment would tune it to 100.5 or is 100.5 an
average. no one picks 100.3 or 100.7? It seems to me that any pitch
in-between could be picked with a higher average around 100.5, that the
entire range would be equal to the pitch. This is probably something
that Scelsi was hearing and attempting to do! It changes our notion of
what a pitch is or can be


By the way the beat canceling idea kind of goes with stockhausen idea of
a "Sonic Trash can" a device that produces the inverse wave causing
silence! don't hold your breath!

This is a standard result in psycho-acoustics. For instance,
there's an extended description and a couple of figures describing it&nbsp;
in Roederer's book (Physics and Psychophysics of Music).

On page 31 there is a footnote:&nbsp;

How do we verify that, indeed, the pitch sensation of the resulting&nbsp;
tone does correspond to a tone of frequency f1+delta f/2? This is&nbsp;
accomplished with pitch matching experiments: the subject is&nbsp;
presented alternatively with a reference tone of controllable pitch&nbsp;
and is requested to "zero in" the frequency of the latter until he&nbsp;
senses "equal pitch" with respect to the original tone.</PRE>
