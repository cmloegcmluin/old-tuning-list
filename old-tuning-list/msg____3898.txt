Denying this would be cutting oneself from 99.99% of Western teaching and 
performance practices.

There seems to be plenty of psychoacoustical evidence that refutes the first 
claim. We do indeed hear pitch logarithmically, where pitch is defined as 
the "virtual pitch" that is assigned to any harmonic or near-harmonic set of 
partials. However, due to beats and combination tones, we can detect much 
finer deviations from an arithmetic or harmonic series in a chord than 
deviations from a geometric (logarithmic) series in either a chord or a 
melody. This leads talented performers to essentially mutate the 12-tone 
grid to achieve 5-limit just intonation in sustained harmonies. It also 
leads people to think of just intonation as representing the way we actually 
hear, but it just ain't so.

Knowing that it is 9 2/3 semitones (you can't hear a 2-cent discrepancy 
under performance conditions), one can calculate a center even more easily: 
4 5/6 semitones (beats won't help you tune this one!). Sixths of semitones 
can be taught systematically, through 11-limit JI harmonies and Arabic and 
Byzantine scales, while cents imply a lot of guesswork. (I'm thinking of how 
to best educate, and notate music for, tomorrow's musicians, not necessarily 
Johnny's highly-skilled ensemble).

I suppose if Johnny wins out, I would recommend restricting the allowed 
deviations to 17, 33, and 50 cents when first beginning a course of 
microtonal education, so that certain points of reference can be 
established. It's just that having to attach numbers like 17 and 33 to these 
sounds seems like an unnecessary burden. For the extreme purists among the 
JI advocates, I would say that really good performers of 11-limit vocal and 
string music will intuitively mutate the 72-tone grid (by no more than 4 
cents) in sustained harmonies to achieve absolute perfection; more accurate 
notation would not be of any help to those with inferior ears.
