Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com asks
"   What the bloody hell is a transcendental number?!  "
Another definition is that it's a number that can not be 
calculated by any finite number of arithmetic operations (add, 
subtract, multiply, divide), i.e. it's one with an infinite 
number of terms in *any* series expansion (not just Taylor). 
In other words, the decimals go on forever without repeating 
with *any* pattern; this lack of pattern is not a lack of 
knowledge, but a logical impossibility.

It's a very useful mathematical concept, but, pace Brian, I 
think he takes the notion beyond the limits of any practical 
tuning into the metaphysical. In fact, if you apply his 
comments about Bach's tuning to the post you refer to, he 
agrees!
