Subject: Re: tone deaf...

From: linusliu@hk.super.net (Linus Liu)

I recognize the sound of three tunings-

One is in tune,
One is out of tune,
One is need not bother, just take it.

When I am in an audience listening to a concert of
any sort of performance, this way is felt just the same in 
everyone else around me, most or all of them do not know
anything about tuning. Even the pianists who play with me
will not believe that every note other than the A on my
violin is different from the piano, until I tune each note
with him on the piano.

Sethares speaks probably for himself and those who KNOW 
about tuning. 

>I recognize the sound of only two tunings - 
>one is 12-tone equal-temperament and the 
>other is not.
