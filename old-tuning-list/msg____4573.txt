I use a little hammer to tick the tongues back and forth gently, it
works ok. I never finished the one I started to build, so I can't give
any building advice, but I have a "real" one from Zimbabwe.
I thought about replacing the bottlecaps with seashells, but couldn't
drill a hole in a shell so I gave that up.
The keys on the right hand side on my mbira are pretty close together,
and not flattened to such a great width that having two tiers is 
necessary. I think that would make playing more difficult.
You will need a big gourd for it too of course, as a soundboard.
