From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Good thoughts, Bart regarding the 19TET trumpet.  I hope you don't mind if I
forward them to the tuning list.  For any of you tuning listers who don't
already know, Bart Hopkin (barthopkin@aol.com) is the editor of Experimental
Musical Instruments magazine.  Here are some thoughts on your thoughts:

   I was thinking in terms of having whatever equipment is necessary at hand.
I'm not sure about the person who posted the original query though.

   I personally was thinking in terms of something that is "upward compatible"
in a sense.  By that I mean something wherein the additional fingering
possibilities 19TET offers go down as a reasonably intuitive variant on
traditional fingerings.  So, to use one of my examples, separate right- and
left-hand valve sets would be fairly easy to adjust to, especially for those who
have played both trumpet and F.horn.  

   But there certainly is value in just plain starting over anew, which your
suggestion below addresses.
