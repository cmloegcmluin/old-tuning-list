Subject: Free Sample Material?

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

Granted, this isn't strictly tuning-related, but it is potentially useful for at least some
of us.

   I haven't checked this out yet, but it sounds intriguing, especially considering how much
I've paid people for sampling material!

   For whatever it's worth, I learned the hard way a while back that to do good sampling, you
need to have a LOT of sampling material to draw from.  There are plenty of guidelines the
sample material must meet, some of which are more or less specific to the particular
instrument or family of instruments.  Whether these have those qualities, or are sufficiently
voluminous I don't know.
