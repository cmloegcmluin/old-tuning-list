During my month away from the list, I too came up with the idea of rhythmic 
temperament, and so was pleasantly suprised to find that it had been 
discussed in my absence.

Although Gary's point has some merit, perhaps he is forgetting that 
logarthmic relationships arise from application of a given multiplicative 
factor, in this case a ratio, several times. There is nothing in the nature 
of rhythm that prevents this from having significance.

For example, one can, in the course of a piece, reinterpret triplets as 
quarter-notes, a rhythmic modulation by a factor of 3/2. Repeat this three 
more times, and you will have accelerated by a factor of 81/16. Now 
interpret every fifth note as the basic pulse, and you will be at 81/80 of 
the original tempo.

Of course, no one will notice that you have not returned to the original 
tempo. But what if you had left the original tempo in place through the 
entire process, in one voice or a drumbeat? You would want to come back to 
it at the end. The polyrhythms in the middle of the process would be too 
complex to hear mathematically, anyway, so why not "temper" them, so that 
the 81/80 becomes a 1/1? Each time the triplets are introduced, they could 
be played a tiny bit too slow, the exact amount of tempering being identical 
to that of meantone tuning.
