Subject: Fretting and non12 mentioning 12tET guitars ;-)

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

Apologies for earlier part-message. I was having telnet
delays between Hawaii and London, and answering on-line live.
 
This first fret change seems to me to be a desperate attempt to 
compensate for the most obvious error on conventional 
guitar fretting.
 
It seems as though even the LA music retaillers are beginning to 
get the point about 12et problems.
 
Does this mean that the whole planet is about to accept,
that 12et will soon be moribund?
 
It was this error, (which is particularly noticeable, on the third 
string, when playing E Major as an "open" chord,) which was one of 
the earliest things that I noticed causing problems with 
12ET guitars.
I used to retune my 12ET guitars dependent upon what key I was 
playing in.
 
I have dozens of different programs and spreadsheets to calculate 
the frettings for various different tunings mostly done on Amiga. 
So let me know whatever anyone may need.
 
Mark Rankin's system is quite clever, as it prints a paper template,
which can be used to mark out the fret positions.
 
There is a guitar workshop on Sunset in Venice CA, about five blocks
from the ocean, which had set up a milling machine to cut a
variety of necks, heads, and fretting some seven years ago.
 
John Carruthers 346 Sunset Ave. Venice CA 90291 (213) 392-3910
 
The deflection of the string, from my experience, is a "red-herring".
This first fret, because of its large distance to the nut is 
larger in millimeters than any of the other errors despite the
integer ratio method of calculating fret positions.
 
When adjusting the bridge position on guitars, it is usual to fret
at the octave, and compare to the "ghostone" above the same fret.
The bridge is then moved nearer or further from the nut until the
pitches co-incide.
 
So if JC is right about the fractional fretting arithmetic, 
the octaves will be correct and everything else will be out of 12tet.
