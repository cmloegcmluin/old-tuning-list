From: damien@spirit.com.au (Damien)

Don't discredit what you have no personal experience or understanding of...
that kind of thinking has caused much unnecessary conflict and suffering
for many - who says the world is round, and that it orbits the sun? Just
because something does not fit into our limited perspective of the world
does not mean it is invalid.

Astrology, on a fundamental level is a interpreted symbolic language of
spacetime vibrations (MUSIC!!!)... It is a cosmology, a system for
understanding the universe and our role in it, and a powerful tool /
metaphor for personal / musical development. The planets (instruments)
vibrate their influence in the environment, each following their own path,
each relating differently to each other depending on the aspects formed...
As for viewing things in terms of the 4 elements (physicality / emotions /
thoughts / archetypal or spiritual), if you are caught up in materialism or
the abstract you are missing out on much of the richness of life.

Carl G Jung spoke of syncronicity, "An acausal connecting principle".
Through scientific investigation he determined that the more one looks into
astrology, the more sense it makes. As modern science states, everything is
relative to the observer, and our beliefs in the world tend to shape our
perception of it.

How can the rising of Mars affect ones life? All things are interconnected
in the "multidimentional universal set". A horoscope is a symbolic
spacetime map / mandala of the vibrations acting on you at the time of your
birth, which tends to influence you into expressing your impressed quality
of vibrations.  From birth onwards the environment and free will gradually
evolve this set into its current form. It is much to simplistic to view
astrology as the influence of "gravitational fields".

Humanity has worked with astrology for at least 6000 years, so maybe there
is something to it?
