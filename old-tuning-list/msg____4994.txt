Subject: Beethoven and C#/Db

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

Well ... perhaps I wasn't writing so clearly as I'd hoped.
Some of the responses didn't seem to follow from what I
thought I'd said !

I shall amplify only what was, I think, my most interesting
point, which was about a remark someone else in Tuning
quoted from Beethoven, that he could hear a difference
between C# and Db. I don't know the source; I'm taking
it at face value.

When someone of Beethoven's competence makes a remark
that seems nonsensical, I suggest that the best thing to do
is to assume that he was saying something reasonable, but
that he was saying it with a shorthand, or that he was
making unmentioned assumptions and corollaries, or something
of that sort. I mean, it seems far more likely that Beethoven
would make an error of verbal communication than that he'd
make a musical error. 

Now, surely everybody who reads this list is aware that
C# and Db are physically identical on a piano. Since Beethoven
probably also knew this, what did he mean when he said that
they were different ? I am only guessing, of course, but perhaps
he was referring to the expectations set up by different harmonic 
contexts. V in F# Major (which would be C# Major) would perhaps be 
reasonably expected to feel more brilliant than flat VI in
F Major (which would be Db Major). Any good tuner could favor
one way or the other. (Someone else also mentioned something
like this in the last Tuning.)

Also, the piano itself could slip to a different flavor from that at 
which it had been set if, for example, the pin block were holding 
unevenly. A fortepiano (which is what Beethoven was often playing) can 
slip quite a bit if you play it hard, and Beethoven played so hard that 
he broke strings sometimes. In which case, as another possibility,
it would be understandable for him to talk about a difference
between C# and Db.

But I don't pretend to know what Beethoven meant in this case.
I think it's interesting food for thought.


Yours,


Will Grant
