   Oh yes, on my opinion.  I certainly don't blame you or anybody else for
having negative reactions to Brian's over-colorful rhetoric.  

   Again on my opinion, Brian just doesn't understand that the tone with which
people read E-mail.  The traditional way to read E-mail is to take it
semipersonally.  I'm not suggesting that that's good or bad, nor that anybody
here is particularly extreme in that regard, but just that that's the way people
work.  

   It's a kind of like how people read bill-collectors' late-payment notices
(well, a little anyway):  The desired reaction to such a first notice of course
is "oh sorry, I must have missed that somehow;  here's your check".  To get that
reaction, the notice must be phrased something like "we've noticed that there
appears to be some sort of delay in payment".  If bill collectors were to phrase
it something like, "what's the deal;  did you fire your accountant or just not
pass the first grade?!", their reaction will be something more like, "well #$&*
you".  

   Now I seriously doubt if Brian would ever write in such an insensitive tone
to an overdue account.  I'm just saying that the problem with his postings is
not that he's a vindictive, spiteful SOB, but just that he doesn't realize that
he needs to use a rhetorical model of his audience a little bit more like an
overdue account than a textbook.  In the social context of a textbook, his
colorful phraseology would be more likely viewed as funny, which I'm pretty sure
is his intention.
