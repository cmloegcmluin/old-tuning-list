In physics I think they're called modes of oscillation. The fundamental mode
is the one with lowest frequency. Maybe the others are just  called 
non-fundamental modes. 

A while back someone described a delightful experiment with prepared
guitar, verifying that these non-fundamental modes need not have frequencies
which are small integer ratios of the fundamental. Under ideal conditions -
uniform strings, and I hear one would need massless frictionless pivots to
hold the ends of the string - ideal conditions would yield a spectrum of
frequencies all integer multiples of the fundamental.

But this is not the only place that integers come up. I just read an amazing
thing, I think in IEEE SPECTRUM, an engineering magazine. There's this new
kind of loudspeaker that's been invented. It's based on the fact that air is
a non-linear acoustic medium. Non-linear means that air isn't a perfect
spring, as you squeeze air it doesn't resist in exact proportion to how much
you squeeze. So the new loudspeaker takes advantage of this. It's composed
of two ultrasonic loudspeakers that each emit sound up around 200 KHz. Dogs
etc. can't hear way up there either. For all I know these may be the best
way to eliminate cockroaches! Anyway, the two ultrasonic speakers actually
play at somewhat different frequencies - for example, suppose one played at
200 KHz and the other at 201 KHz. What happens, when two oscillating forces
hit a nonlinear medium, is that new oscillations get induced at the sum and
difference frequencies. So new oscillations appear at 401 KHz and 1 KHz. Of
course 401 KHz is inaudible. But the 1 KHz... hey, where'd that sound come
from! 

The IEEE Spectrum mentioned as I recall that Carver is involved in producing
a product based on this new invention.

Anyway, if you start with two frequencies and start taking sums and
differences:

a, b, a+b, a-b, a+2b, 2a-b, 2a+2b, 2a, 2b, 3a+b, etc.

somehow amazingly integers pop up. Now I'm not particularly enamoured of the
creationist view of the world, but I'll follow Haverstick at least to the
point that it looks like the integers are just somehow the way things are.

The ear itself is undoubtedly non-linear. I imagine that's why we can hear
"beat frequencies". 

Anyway, my whole point is that just intonation need not be founded on the
frequencies of modes of oscillation of a string. Personally I don't think you
can find secure foundations for any conceptual system, though even insecure
foundations can be quite useful. The best foundation for just intonation,
seems to me, is just the way various pitch combinations sound to us
humans. Of course, our perception is also shaped by the conceptual systems
that have been used to construct our environment. But anyway if you look for
why humans might like simple ratios of frequencies, there are more answers
around than just strings.
