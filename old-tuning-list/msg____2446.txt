Subject: notation; XH16

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Brian's reaction to my article on notation of ETs deserves comment, and I 
will have things to say eventually. But first I would like to give people 
a chance to read it--it's been out only a few weeks.

I would also like to see other comments before I reply. Would anyone oblige?

In any case, I also recommend Xenharmonikon as a publication dealing with
microtonal music, especially to those on this forum who may not know it.
This has nothing to do with my article being in No. 16. All issues may be
obtained, I believe, both from Frog Peak Music on the east coast and from
the Just Intonation Store on the west coast.
