Yes, Web search engines are dumb, but that doesn't mean the user has to be 
dumb too. "Microtonality" is not really a very common word. Try 
"microtones," "temperament," "just intonation," etc. I find new stuff every 
time I sit down at a browser. Last time I found out that a recent issue of 
Leonardo Music Journal had two articles on Javanese tuning. I started 
reading them at the library last night, and thought to myself,

	    THANK GOD FOR WEB SEARCH ENGINES!

Sure, the Web is a mess, it's not user-friendly, and leads to a lot of dead 
ends, but so is the real world! Makes life interesting. An internet full of 
McLaren-approved web pages sounds like an Orwellian nightmare to me. Just as 
Brian expresses himself though raving posts to this list, so must each of us 
express our creativity/insanity through idiosyncratic Web pages.
