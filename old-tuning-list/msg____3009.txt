Brian's and Neil's advocacy of a new direction in music theory instruction
is certainly welcome. I have taught the harmonic series in music theory,
computer music, world music and other classes whenever I have been able to.
And, despite Brian's characterization of university professors as a
monolithic bastion against such ideas, I know of other professors who also
think that a revision of standard music theory curricula is long overdue.
But there are problems:

1) Large-scale revisions of multi-semester sequences taught by different
people are very difficult to implement (especially by young, untenured
instructors). If the semester 3 instructor is expecting the students to
know what a Neapolitan sixth is, then that's something the semester 2
instructor is obliged to include. Enough of these obligations and there's
little time left for the harmonic series. There may also be connections and
expectations outside of the sequence, with music history classes for
example. The difficulty of forging a very new consensus is certainly part
of what gives academic institutions their reputation for conservative
inertia.

2) Let's not forget the students. In my (admittedly limited) experience,
they come in three basic flavors:
a) The students who are basically non-music majors who are mainly
interested in learning to read music, understand chords, and know harmonic
progressions well enough to write their own pop songs. A few of the more
technically-minded find the information on the harmonic series interesting,
but ultimately useless for their purposes.
b) The students who are mostly music majors who are mainly interested in
spending time in the practice room and understand that they have to go
through the drudgery of recreating Bach chorales before they can graduate.
Some are interested in understanding the way the music they play was
composed, but many don't really care to know the compositional significance
of a particular unusual chord in the Brahms piano piece they're playing,
let alone the harmonic series.
c) The really insightful ones who want to know the fundamental basis of
their art and have the creativity of thought to try to apply this knowledge
in beautiful and innovative ways. In my experience this type of student is
a happy, but all too uncommon, find.

I'm not really trying to bash students. Like all of us, they have certain
goals in their lives that drive their decisions. Very often they don't see
how things like the harmonic series serve those goals (and in many cases
they are right). I don't think that university educators should necessarily
pander to them, but I think it's unrealistic to expect a music school to
completely flaunt the students' educational goals and instead force another
curriculum on them.

I agree that the time and attention devoted to the minutiae of harmonic
practices of European art music in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
in most music programs is seriously disproportionate. In my opinion, much
of that time would be better spent on tuning systems, acoustics, and music
of other cultures and traditions.

I don't want to give the impression that the situation is hopeless either.
These concepts can be given limited exposure in standard classes, much more
exposure in classes outside the regular curriculum, and even more through
personal contact with enthusiastic, intelligent students.
