I saw this on rec.music.early. Does anyone know anything more about 
this and the music played? (Johnny?).

I don't know anything about this particular performance, but the repertory
is fairly well-known to EM keyboardists.  Definitely, as far as recordings
go, the one to hear is Alan Curtis' on Nuova Era 7177

BTW, I was re-reading Bosanquet's 1876 book "An Elementary Treatist on 
Musical Intervals and Temperament" in which he describes his famous
generalized keyboard. What caught my attention was a section where he
calculates musical logarithms, in this case the semitone measure of
ratios (equivalent to cents divided by 100). Bosanquet computes his own
logs from a series expansion approximation rather than using tables
and implies that the proofs of such expansions were commonly given in
19th century trig books. Anyway, a longer discussion which illuminated
the method of Ellis, which I posted to the tuning list last Spring (or
so). The method appears less to have been pulled out of thin air than
it does in Ellis's exposition in Helmholtz.

I, for one, would like to see David Feldman's table of "isotempered" 
interval pairs. Alas, I have an old, small screen Mac and would need
the reformatted or a hardcopy version.

By using Brun's algorithm, it was easy to show that Feldman is correct
in that the series of relations of the degrees of the fifth Q to those
in the octave T: Q\T ~3\5, 4\7, 7\12, 10\17, 17\29, 24\41, 31\53,
55\94 corresponds to the number of degrees of the 13/9 in the 
equal divisions of the 15/8.

One might describe this as series of compressed octaves which in
which the relative size of the 13/9 corresponds to the relative
size of the 3/2 in the original series of octaval ET's. 

I also played around with another, but related, problem of finding 
optimal ET's for sets of all 4 numbers, in this case 2/1, 15/8, 3/2 
and 13/9.  Using Viggo Brun's version of the euclidean algorithm, I got 
the  following N-tone ET's: 10, 19, 24, 43, 53, 72, 125, 178...(only 
those which distinguish all 4 ratios are listed). Selmer's version 
oscillates a bit, but finds 20, 21, 12, 26, 34, 46, 33, 41, 54, 75, 
62, 87,  162. Pipping's ramified version gave erratic results, though 
it works fine for 3 terms.
