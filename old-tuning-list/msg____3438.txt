Neil,

I'm sorry to report that morbidity is actually very popular. In my 
neighborhood, I see quite a few people dressed as vampires and zombies and 
other generic corpses. They go to scary clubs and listen to music that makes 
your soul shudder. Personally, I enjoy the morbid aspects of Beethoven's 
late work as much as its more positive emotions. If an expanded set of 
pitches helps an emotion to come across, that to me is wonderful and makes 
the music worth paying attention to. I hear the future of music as a sonic 
exploration of emotions more difficult than those expressible with 5-limit 
materials. It'll take a lot of great composers to make this happen. Maybe - 
just maybe - Partch is one of those composers?

 -Paul
