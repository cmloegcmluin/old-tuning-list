Just to set the record straight, Charles Lucy originally wrote me the
forwarded email to respond to a post in the context of defining pitches in
some modes as subsets of tuning systems. I wrote him back that I had no
intention of setting up a competing "Alves system" as he has implied.

I merely wanted a brief way, in that post alone, to specify number of
pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the mode/commonly used
auxilary pitches. Three numbers separated by slashes seemed an
understandable way to do it. I included obvious qualifications and had no
intention to try to express the actual tuning of these modes.

I also told Charles Lucy that I found the Lucy/Gibbon/Glasier system
interesting (if largely unrelated to the point of my post), but that I
doubt that all tuning systems or modes could or should be defined in terms
of MOS scales. I promised to try to avoid confusion in the future.

If this explanation is "lame," so be it, but, goodness, can't a person
express himself with numbers and slashes sometimes?

Bill
