Subject: RE: Special Way

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

I thank Carl for the review, and I will try to respond to some of his
contentions.

>}What is this Special Way?  Krumhansl, quoted by Mr. Erlich, seems to be

}He then defines a set of scales as candidates for representing the
7-limit.
 }These scales are assumed to be root of 2 equal-step tunings, with only
one
}pitch per 7-limit approximation.

>I couldn't very well consider every possible tuning system in the paper.

>And I do love far-out avant garde music like Henry Cow, when I'm in the mood
