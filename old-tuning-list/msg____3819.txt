From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

If one is writing music down prescriptively (e.g. for another musician to 
play from), it is important that the player fully understand the tuning.

At some point reference must be made to cents (@ 1200 cents per octave).  

Using straight forward quartersharp and quarterflat in addition to 
traditional notation, and by indicating finer pitch differentiation by 
numbers above noteheads.  Only numbers from 1 up to 49 are necessary, and 
they need a + or a - before them to show the direction to take.

String players quickly learn this by sight.  Woodwind players must 
develop fingerings anyway which they place even further above the 
noteheads.  Vocalists can navigate these basic deviations from a 12-tone 
ET grid with assurance because there is always represented the "exact" 
note in theory.  

When working with microtonal scales in diversity, a notation that applies 
to all notations makes great sense for its value.  1200 cents is surely 
a fair threshold to the numbers necessary.  Honestly, this is the fastest 
notation to speed rehearsals.
