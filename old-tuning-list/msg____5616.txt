The closest you can come to 12tet in quartet playing is rumored to have
been the Kolisch quartet, whose recordings of the Schoenberg quartets have
been recently rereleased. I haven't listened closely enough to make any
definitive comments, but the Major thirds are certainly sharp, and although
the general tone quality is not my favorite, the appropriateness for the
more expressionist material of both intonation and tone color is absolutely
clear.

Anyone interested in Schoenberg's ideas about intonation (in favor of
temperament, with an interesting turn on ''natural'' tuning) should look at
his letter to Joseph Yasser, published in the Musical Quarterly in 1945(?).
