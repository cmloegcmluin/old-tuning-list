   John - would you mind forwarding this on to the list, since I'm here at
work
all day?  Thanks!

   Oh.  Actually the millihertz case would never happen, since that would
be
the receding scenario, and obviously, traveling at roughly mach 85 (in that
example), the sound would clearly never catch up with you!

   More importantly though, I accidentally applied the meter-to-kilometer
conversion factor backward.  The speed at which relativistic effects would
be
about 1 millionth of a percent is about 65 THOUSAND (not billion) miles per
hour.  (Ooops)  That speed is somewhat faster than the typical reentry
speed of
a meteorite.  So you'd burn up in a matter of seconds rather than
nanoseconds.
