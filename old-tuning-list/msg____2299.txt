Subject: Partch and resolution

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

The current discussion of tonal drive and resolution in JI 
seems to me to miss an elementary point stressed by Harry Partch 
himself. JI increases the range of available consonance and dissonance 
however C and D are defined, see Tenney's book _A History of 
Consonance and Dissonance_. 
	Hence, in some contexts the dominant seventh chord should be 
tuned 4:5:6:7 for maximum consonance, but in others one might wish to 
use 20:25:30:36 (1/1 5/4 3/2 6/5) or even 36:45:54:64 (1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9). 
	One should read Chapter 11, "The Question of Resolution,"
in HP's _Genesis of a Music_, 2nd edition, pp 181-194. While HP
wrote everything in the key of G (392 hz), in part because of
material and technical limitations, in part for theoretical reasons 
(monophony is the harmonic expansion of a single tone, the 1/1, see
the definition on page 71), he was very aware of resolution and
chordal motion and wrote some extremely dissonant, yet powerful 
progressions. (Allen, do you still have your notes from his UCSD 
class?).
	Partch suggested several principles: Resolve voices by very
narrow intervals, avoid 11 O or U identities (11 th harmonic or 
subharmonic of the tonic) in the bass, space the voices widely, and 
mix harmonic and subharmonic (O and U) chords in progressions. One does 
not have to use complete hexads (1 3 5 7 9 11 harmonics) and the remaining voices  may be doubled as desired. Non-harmonic tones and tones outside 
the conventional 43-tone scale may also be used (HP sometimes did this 
on the canons and even changed reeds on the Chromelodea, i.e., 25/21 
in Delusion.)
