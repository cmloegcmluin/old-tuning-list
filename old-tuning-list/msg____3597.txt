Subject: TUNING digest 833: Re IRCAM

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Before IRCAM is written off entirely, it should also be considered that
funding for the institution comes both from direct subsidies and from
"commercial" activities, which include, on the one hand, Ensemble
Intercontemporain recording Frank Zappa, and on the other, more lucrative
and self-sustaining hand, applications for the military-industrial complex.

I recall a seminar in Darmstadt in 1990 when two highly placed IRCAM
functionaries all but ridiculed the applicability of personal computers to
new music applications as they promoted their latest mainframe or
workstation format. The fact that composers using PC´s (Apples, Ataris &
Amigas, too) were more productive than those fighting for time on
constantly redeveloped and constantly crashing big systems seem to have
made no impression on the functionaries. After all, productive composers
don´t create the cost overruns which are the mother´s milk of the
M-I-complex.
