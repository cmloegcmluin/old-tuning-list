I'm finally back on line since my address was changed to reinhard@idt.net

I've been teaching music composition and theory at C.W. Post, Long Island
University so that list member Howard Rovics can take a sabatical.  Prof.
Rovics is composing for bassoon and flute in eighthtones, along with
synthesizer in the mean time. 

Thursday, March 6th I am lecturing at Post on Ives' Universe Symphony, now
studio mixed to CD, non-commercial.

I have been reading the list, however, and would like to add 2 cents.

For Beethoven to declare his ability to distinguish between and C# and Db
would coincide with Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Beethoven's contemporary and
pianistic rival.  Humel writes in 1850 in his piano treatise that though
the piano erases the distinctions between enharmonic relationships, they
are important for composition.  And that this needn't concern the pianist.

It also is interesting that there seems a Dutch propensity to keeping JS
Bach in the 12ET corral.  When Rudolf Rasch published his Musicalische
Temperatur edition from plates, untranslaed, he added a lengthy prologue
regardings his conjectures on Bach's tuning.  This, though, there is nary
a mention of 12ET.  I am in possession of a translation of this _still_
untranslated cornerstone of tuning history thanks to Mark Lindley, by way
of one Elizabeth Hehr.

In my paper _Bach's Tuning_ published in PITCH I:2 I challenged
Professor Rasch - a good friend and always Rudolf to me.  There are those
that do not recognize either the aesthetic virtue of variegated keys, or
its historical likelihood.
