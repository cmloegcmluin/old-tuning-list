Check out a book by composer Henry Cowell titled, I think, _New Musical Resources_.
He goes into metric modulation, and stacked polyrhythms or rhythmic chords, based
on whole numbers.

I disagree. Play anything you know to a metronome which is marking 80 beats per
minute, then play it again at 81. Notice the difference in feel? I think the
audience would as well. I forget which of the mainstream music newsmagazines
lists the tempos of the most popular dance tracks in fractions of beats per
minute, like mm 125.2, so other musicians, and DJ's, etc. can tune in to the
narrow bands of most-fashionable tempos that people are responding to. A
tempo difference of 125/124 can apparently affect the popularity of a tune.

The problem with tempered rhythms is in their combination. Tempered triplets say
would drift if played against quarter notes; they wouldn't line up at the
measure length. If this is what you want, then cool. An irrationally related
duration set could give a nice effect of non-groundedness while retaining
self consistency.

If you want to do a series of metric modulations which end up at the same tempo,
without having to temper them, make sure the same numbers which occur in the
numerators also occur in the denominators.

    2   3   2   1
t * - * - * - * - t
    1   2   3   2

To make the progression not retrace the same steps, shuffle the order of numerators or
denominators or both (without exchanging numerator with denominator):

    2   2   1   3
t * - * - * - * - t
    1   3   2   2

I wrote a piece which did something like this for The Martin Dancers here in Los Angeles.
It repeated a "rhythmic progression" of meters related by common pulses.

Something I wish to do with tempos and with pitch is to write progressions which
repeat their link pattern but do not end up at the same place (using whole
numbers, not tempered). I think this would sound neat. The simplest example is
the "spiral" of continuous 3/2 fifth root motion, but nicer ones must be waiting
out there too.
