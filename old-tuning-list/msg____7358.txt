   Manuel Op de Coul has a discography ... somewhere.  Is that on a web
page perhaps, Manuel?

   As for written mater, most of us could cite our favorite books, but here
are some that address tuning history among other topics:  John Chalmers'
"Divisions of the Tetrachord", Hermann Helmholz's "On the Sensations of
Tone", J. Murray Barbour's "Tuning and Temperament", J.P. Rameau's
"Treatise on Harmony".

   Also, Brian McLaren wrote a "Short History of Microtonality" (the title
something like that anyway).  That might be a good overview, with
references for further exploration.  I confess that I haven't read it
entirely, and I did read of it I liked, but it was quite a while back.
Brian can be reached via snail-mail at 2462 S.E. Micah Place;  Coravallis,
OR  97333-1966;  USA.  There are rumors going around that he has a phone
now though...
