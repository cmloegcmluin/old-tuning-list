From: momilani@writeme.com

Dear all, I am a grad student doing a paper on the history of alternate tuning systems and how we composers are using some of them today. The info here is great, but I need citeable references. Any and all books, journals, articles, and URLs would be mightily appreciated.Thanks very much for the clear info presented here.
