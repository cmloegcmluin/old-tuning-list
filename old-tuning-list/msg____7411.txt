Subject: Women in the Dunes (Suna No Onna)

From: John Dieterich <diete001@tc.umn.edu>

Hello!  I came across something the other night that I thought I could
tell everyone about.  Has anyone seen the Japanese movie, "Woman in the
Dunes" (Suna No Onna) by Hiroshi Teshigahara (1964)?  The music is by
Tohru Takemitsu, and I believe it to be non-12--lots of sweeping, eerie
strings, etc.  It's an absolutely beautiful movie, too.  I couldn't
recommend it more.

I'm relatively new this list, and I find myself struggling to understand
the complexities of microtonality and the terminology you all use (I
don't have hardly any formal music training), but I always glean
something from the posts.  Thanks!
