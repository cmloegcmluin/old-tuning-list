The Kurzweil K2000 and K2500 update low level parameters at a 50 Hz rate,
which is every 20 ms.  Most other synths probably update at about half that
rate.  For that short a duration I doubt you'd hear anything unless the
pitch
bend was 50 cents or more.

The MIDI Tuning Dump standard certainly has deficiences, probably because
not many people contributed to its conception.

The greatest limitation is the insistance on handling tuning dumps
only on a full keyboard basis.  This makes dynamic tuning programs
like Justonic's almost impossible as the MIDI bandwidth can't
support real-time updates.

The other problem is the immediate updating of sustained notes.
This is also a problem for real-time key modulations, especially
for rapid paced music.

One thing I've seen mentioned is the desire for tuning of better
than 1 cent resolution.  Manufacturers are not likely to incorporate
such a feature, not because it is too expensive (it requires 4-8 bits
more resolution in the oscillator/accumulator and any associated
registers, something that would be almost trivial to add), but rather
because all samplers and sample playback based synthesizers
are lucky if their samples are tuned to better accuracy than this.

This wouldn't be a problem in a non-sample based instrument.  But
most of the newer DSP-based analog modeling synthesizers are
retro in one additional way -- they don't include tuning tables.  The
only exception is the Korg Prophecy.
