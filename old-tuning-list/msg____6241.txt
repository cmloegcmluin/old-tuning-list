Try the Sachs-Hornbostel System.  Experimental Musical Instruments
magazine publishes a wall chart with it on, but I'm sure there are
other sources as well.  More info on ExpMusInsts at
http://www.thecombine.com/emi

BTW the EMI wall chart has all sorts of info on it, like frequency, pitch
and wavelength in 12 tone et, standard music wire gages, formulas for
various resonant cavities, pitches of the harmonic series, overtone
recipes for common vibrating forms, scale factors for various equal
temperaments, etc, etc.  Even though it's intended for builders of acoustic
instruments, I find it essential on the wall of my computer music studio.
Info at the above website.  (unabashed plug!)

Cheers,

Warren
