Subject: Microtonal Webern

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

In the just published volume of the _Mitteilungen der Paul Sacher Stiftun=
g_
(No. 11, April 1998) is a brief article by Dominik Schweiger with the
titled _Weberns verworfene Mikrot=F6ne_. =


This deals with two pitches found in variant manuscript versions of two
songs, 'An baches ranft' from op. 3, and 'Das Lockere saatgefilde lechzet=

krank' from the 1908-09 _Four Stefan George Songs_. Schweiger offers some=

suggestions as to the interpretation of these two pitches which are defin=
ed
by the composer only as lying between two 12tet pitches. The harmonic
contexts are not analysed here in any detail, so it is unclear whether
Webern had specific pitches in mind or was just seeking some particularly=

expressive intonation, one, as Schweiger points out, possibly related to
_Sprechgesang_.
