The ambiguity in your definition is the difference between
27/16 and 12/7.  This is log2(12/7)-log2(27/16) = 0.022720
octaves.  Assuming the simplest interpretation of the 22
srutis, 22tet, the uncertainty is 1/44 = 0.022727 octaves.
It is not, therefore, correct to say that this is
significantly more precise than Bharata.  The two
definitions of svaras are, however incompatible.  By the
C17th, the 22 srutis were of only historical importance,
so I wouldn't expect agreement.  We must also ask: is
this a North or South Indian scale?

For a bit of pedantry, couldn't 72/57 be 24/19?

To state my own position: whether or not the standard srutis
were ever used by musicians, it is a very good theory.
Whether or not 5-limit harmony was ever intended, enough
scales are consistent with it that I don't believe this is
a coincidence.  I don't follow a diaschismic interpretation
any more, as I think my more recent posts made clear.  I
could do with a longer list of ragas defined on srutis.

This "anuvadi" is consistent with what I know of modern
Indian theory.  I'm perfectly happy with fourths and fifths
and being perfect and thirds imperfect "consonances".

Are any of these primary sources available in English
translation?


P.S. apologies for my unwarranted comment in the
demisemitone discussion.  I regretted it not long after
I sent that message.  There are some intelligent and
knowledgeable people on this list, and I appreciate the
attention you're giving me.
