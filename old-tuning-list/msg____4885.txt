Subject: 5- (and higher) limit monophony in real life

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Pythagorean monophony and equidistant scale steps are by no means as
ubiquitous as PAULE claims. Some European and Euro-American
counter-examples:

Irish folk music - especially unaccompanied Sean Nos singing - consistantly
demonstrates that leaps of major thirds are sung smaller than ditones and
that once a third has been established by the singer, an unequal infill
(i.e. 9:8, 10:9) is virtually inevitable. (The entire Schenker project rest
on an analogous insight - and Schenker's analyses of vii and ii chords
deserves another posting).  Alpine unaccompanied singing shares a tendency
towards higher limit intervals, including 7:6 minor third - possibly
imported from yodeling and alphorn playing. Scandinavian folk music shares
the five limit preference, with frequent comma shifts - while avoiding
comma sinking. American shape-note singers - with a more conservative
harmonic vocabulary than Barbershoppers - use a rich vowel sound to get
asist in maintaining the pitch in unison passages also do 5 limit thirds.

Outside of Europe:

A recent concert of Laotian music (Khaen and vocal) at Hessischer Rundfunk
gave ample demonstration that vocalists ''corrected'' the 7tet scale to a
scale with unequal steps. While slendro has some structural affinities for
5tet - and with pythaagorean pentatonics -  it is decidedly unequal when
realised by vocalists, rebab and suling players.  (A three-limit
realisation of pelog is impossible, I reckon.) The ''harmonic'' traditions
of the Asian steppe include a huge body of solo songs with consistant
intervals clearly outside of a three limit framework. Chinese monophony
will often include comma shifts - both syntonic and septimal. Central
African choral music....

Need I go on any further?
