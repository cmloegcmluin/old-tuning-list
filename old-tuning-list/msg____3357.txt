I was not referring to 88CET, as I have never worked with this tuning. Nor 
was I saying that the nearest available approximation to an octave would 
automatically work like one. The point is that if a note comes close enough 
to an octave or a multiple octave, it will sound equivalent, especially in 
the case of harmonic partials. For example, an interval of 33 Pierce steps 
exhibits equivalence, even though it is a very different pitch class in the 
tritave scheme. Even when the even partials are removed, I believe the 
virtual pitch sensation is not very octave-specific.

In the case of inharmonic partials, octave equivalence may play less of a 
role, but still exists, and is less demanding as to intonation. Gamelan 
music is a case in point: a recent post indicated that Javanese musicians 
are well aware of the pure octave, probably through second-order beating, 
but they prefer to detune it and find quite a wide range of acceptable 
octave sizes.
