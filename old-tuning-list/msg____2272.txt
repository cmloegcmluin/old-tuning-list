Subject: Gary Morrison's post on why CD's

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick here...I was very glad to see Morrison address the
motives behind putting out recordings...I have been a "microtonalist"
for mere 6 years, but a guitarist/performer for 30, and I think that my
background of playing zillions of freelance gigs, from blues jazz and
country to Symphony Pops concerts to avant garde atonal stuff has been a
wonderful thing as I approach the problem of bringing alternate tunings
to "ordinary" folks. You bet your butt I am not putting out CD's only to
think of reaching a small, select group of my peers...I see "microtonal"
music as the only viable way for "western" music to go, so I am doing my
darndest to reach anyone I can...being a guitarist is a great advantage
in this regard, as it is probably the "pop" axe of choice in the world
today, especially with younger folks...I have had great success here in
Denver with reaching a wide spectrum of people with these (to most
people) new musical concepts. I went to my church gig sunday, and there
on the bulletin board was a newspaper article about yours truly and the
Microstock festival...people all over town are getting curious, and in a
very natural way...this, I feel, is good.
    I feel we are put on this Earth to DO something, so my goals are
high...I won't be happy (I am happy, actually...that's just a figure of
speech) until the tyranny of 12 equal tones is forever demolished...I
believe that there are many many ways to tune and play, and I plan to
let people know that this is OK
    Sorry to ramble...of course a CD should be killer, both musically
and in a marketing sense...for better or worse, we live in a very
"market" oriented world, so I don't mind taking the challenge...how can
one honorably market a good product without being like a used car
salesman? I hope to keep working on that question, and I plan to record
as much as possible, and educate as much as possible too, but in a
peaceful way...I agree with Gary...why spend thousands of buckos unless
you really mean it to be successful? Of course, one must always account
for other people's paths as well, so if someone wants to put out a CD
for other reasons, more power to them...this is a good subject to
discuss...Hstick
