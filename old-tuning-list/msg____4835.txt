Subject: Kopie von: Greek compositions

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Betreff:Kopie von: Greek compositions

The main source is:

Egert Po''hlmann, _Denkma''ler Altgriechischer Musik_, (Verlag Hans Carl,
Nu''rnberg, 1970).

Thomas Mathiesen and M(artin).L.West have published surveys of works
uncovered since this time. Mathiesen is controversial and West's recent
monograph on Ancient Greek Music presents some useful alternative readings
(sorry I haven't got the exact reference). Also recommended is Warren
Anderson's MUSIC AND MUSICIANS IN ANCIENT GREECE (1994).

There have also been a couple of recordings made of reconstructions - for
example, the _Musique de la Grece Antique_ by the Atrium Musicae de Madrid
(harmonia mundi cd HMA 1901015) - about which I am unenthusiastic.

I have also heard tell that Andrew Barker has founded an International
Society for the Study of Greek and Roman Music (ISSGRM) with a newsletter -
but I have thus far been unable to obtain any more information.
