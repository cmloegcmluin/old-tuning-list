Subject: Re: modes and tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Certain important musical terms regularly employed by microtonalists have
multiple meanings, including mode, pentatonic, and enharmonic.

Though coming off the recent AFMM series, the above distinctions are a
welcome diversion.  (I'm really enjoying David Beardsley's report.)

Re: modes with Greek-area names, they have changed mightily since the dawn
of Greek culture.  Phrygian, Lydian, Aeolian, etc. were distinct peoples
with cultural models for their modes.  This information is lost.  The
Greeks recognized a healthy diversity in combining the characteristics of
these prehistoric ethnic scales into a modulating 2-octave infrastructure,
a scalar system.  The Church modes of the middle ages looking backwards
over a spate of centuries relabelled modes in practice with earlier
nomenclature (e.g. Phrygian, Lydian, etc.)  Modern useage is limited to
12-TPO well-temperaments.

Pentatonic tuning can be in just intonation, pythagorean tuning,
12ET, 5-ET, and presumeably any other 5-note scale (including
auxillaries).  Might we not include Indonesian Pelog, quartertone
deriveatives, and any other series of relationships of 5 notes that can
modulate to any one of its members?

Enharmonic meant an ancient Greek genus that primarily featured a just
major third (5/4) and 2 distinct, but different "quartertones."  Euripides
was said to favor it in his tragedies, for which he composed music.  It
lost out historically to more equally spaced Diatonic scales.  Composers
like Nicolo Vicentino in the Renaissance revisited it.  By the Baroque,
enharmonic intervals were a comma in size, this reflecting a distinction
between a C# and a Db.  G.F. Handel is reported to have had split-black
keys on his organ, allowing for 14 note per octave capability.  Gradually,
the enharmonic difference transmuted into an identity, thanks largely to
the piano's tuning compromise.

It may be best for the list to be very clear on the above distinctions.
Harry Partch's "monophony" as the fabric of his O- and U-tonality is
certainly a stretch from the homophonic or heterophonic lines of the
Middle Ages.
