   I was using the word "error" in the mathematical sense of the word:  a
difference - pitch difference in this case.  That's all.  Call it a
pseudocomma "delta" if you'd like.  And I agree that it is indeed a very
useful musical effect.

   It's a "pseudo"comma rather than a comma for two reasons:
*  It does what it does on closed set of pitches rather than producing an open
   set of pitches like the ... original, official, or whatever you want to call
   it ... syntonic comma.
*  It's not an 81:80 frequency ratio.

   Neither Ivor nor I intended "pseudo" to suggest that its not real, nor
"error" to suggest that its a mistake.
