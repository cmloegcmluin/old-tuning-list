   Oh.  It's probably fair to say that that depends on what sorts of
unusual tunings you're interested in.  If you expect to render *very* long,
sustained chords, in exact JI with no vibrato or most any other expressive
device, then better than 0.1Hz resoltion could potentially have value.  I'm
inclined to thinkg that there probably aren't many musically-realistic
cases that require that, though.

   But as for what the MR-series' and ASR-X's resolution is, I confess that
I don't personally know.  Presumably John Loffink's web page lists it.

   I have heard that to be the case here on the list, but I didn't myself
make that that claim, nor do I personally know that for certain.  But they
do support the MIDI tuning, which, from what little I do know of it, does
have significant support for dynamic tuning.
