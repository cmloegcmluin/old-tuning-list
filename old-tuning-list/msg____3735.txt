Subject: non-tempered synthesizers

From: ice777@cdsnet.net (Michael Vannice)

I'm on the digest, so I hope I'm not being redundant. The re-posted synth
evaluation was helpful, but a few worthwhile units were not mentioned. In
particular, the Marion Systems ASR-2 and Pro-Synth both have 4 tuning tables
which are completely retunable to 1/512th of a cent. According to Keyboard
Magazine's 1996 Buyer's Guide (December 1995), Korg's Trinity and General
Music's S2, S3, and S2R are also completely retunable. If 12-key tunability
is OK, recent Roland models (e.g. JV and XP series) are capable. Keyboard
lists Roland SC series modules as being retunable, but I didn't see how from
looking at the manuals. Their new sound expansion modules can't be retuned.
I was told by a Yamaha tech on the phone that the VL70m is 12-key retunable
via software. I have talked to some manufacturer reps about non-12ET tuning;
their perception is often that not enough buyers  care about it.
