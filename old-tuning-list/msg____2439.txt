Subject: The Just Intonation Ear Trainer

From: alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)

I have just completed a program called the Just Intonation Ear Trainer,
which is like a standard interval drilling program, except that you select
the intervals from Harry Partch's gamut. It uses the same sound driver as
JICalc, written by K. Romana Machado, and thus shares its requirements and
limitations: It is a HyperCard stack, meaning that it requires HyperCard or
HyperCard Player version 2.0 or higher. It will only work on a Macintosh,
and will not work on a PowerMac or a Performa with a PowerPC processor.

I have currently attached it to my web page:

URL:http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/

I have also attached a few sound samples to the web pages about my
compositions, if you are inclined to explore further. There are samples in
both aiff and wav formats.

The Just Intonation Ear Trainer is shareware, meaning that I request that
you send me $10 or a recording of original compositions in non-12TET if you
find the program useful. You may also redistribute it and put it on ftp
sites, but you may not sell it without my permission.

I would be happy to hear any feedback, especially bug reports. I hope you
find it fun and useful!
