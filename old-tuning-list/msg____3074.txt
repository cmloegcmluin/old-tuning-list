--
As some of you may know, Gayle Young is a Canadian
just intonation composer who builds her own JI
instruments, performs in multimedia dance spectacles,
raises a kid, and runs the best new music magazine in
Canadia.
Along with the magazine MusicWorks, subscribers can
opt to receive a MusicWorks CD containing recordings
of compositions by the composers featured in each
issue.
For MusicWorks 64, Gayle Young's own JI compositions
'Harmonium' for string quartet is featured.
This is a splendid piece of music, full of exotic and
vibrant high-limit just intonation chords.
Ms. Young is a fine composer, and it's splendid to be
able to hear her work on CD.
My main complaint is that the piece is too short!
In any case, both the magazine MusicWorks (which often
features xenharmonic composers and their work) and
the MusicWorks 64 CD is *highly* recommended.
[P.S.: MusicWorks 60 contains the single finest 
explication of Erv Wilson's CPS method of scale
generation, along with nonpareil photos of geometric
models and diagrams by Erv himself.  The article is
"Just Shape, Nothing Central" by the nonpareil Paul
Rapoport.  This article is a *must-have* for anyone
interested in non-12 tunings.]
