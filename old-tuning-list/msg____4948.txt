As an electric/acoustic guitar player / instrument maker on sympathetic
resonance. An electric guitar does not feedback through magnet loops, I have
done this with home made E-bow like things (electromagnetic bows) and the
sound is much different. What you hear is the speaker moving enough air to
move the body of the guitar, this then moves the strings. If the the strings
are stopped then you will hear squealing which is usually through the pickups
which, when older and not waxed, will act as poor microphones at the same
time as electromagnetic pickups. 
 A string will move sympathetically but usually it is the body it is attached
to which is designed to radiate sound, and therefore sensitive to sound
itself, which moves most.
