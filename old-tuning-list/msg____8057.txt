Never mind, here's one: in the 3-5 lattice, let the 9/8 (2 0) and the
128/125 (0 3) vanish.  The determinant of the matrix is 6; in 6TET
the closest interval (just barely) to the 3/2 is actually 4 steps, but
it's the 3-step interval which must be used as the 3/2 if the 9/8 is to
vanish.

Um--so now that we have the example, what was the question again?
