Subject: Sympathetic Strings

From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

To Daniel Wolf,

Sorry, I don't have time to get experiment (1) together this afternoon,
as I have to leave to taeach in a few minutes.  I tried experiment (2), 
singing directly onto the back of the violin.  Th e amplitude was 
about the same as it was when I sang directly at the string on the
front of the violin.  The resonator (the body of the violin) does not
respond to the pitch by itself - I don't get a sympathetic ringing at
the pitch if I hold all the strings (both sides of the bridge) so that
they cannot vibrate.  So I think the frequency of the pitch I'm
singing must be transmitted by air to the string, and the loscloser my
mouth (the sound source) and the louder the pitch, the better.
Probably then the resonator and the string intereact, transmitting
the vibrations back and forth (since they're connected) so that
the resonator amplifies the sound of the violin.
