Subject: Patenting Tunings, etc.

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I believe the H. in  H. Christopher L-H's name stands for Hugh.
The is another researcher named L.-H., but I think he's the son.

Harry Partch once told me that Stockhausen came over and visited
him for an afternoon when the Partch studio was in Petaluma in
the office suite of a former chicken hatchery. K-HS spent the afternoon
with Harry and was particularly intrigued with the harmonic canon, which
he spent some time playing and listening to. This visit would have 
taken place in the early 60's, so I think the chance of a direct
influence is quite high, K-HS's claims notwithstanding.

I'm not a lawyer (I have some standards, low as they may be), 
but I know that it is/has been possible to patent implementations
of tunings. There are a number of patented 1/4-tone pianos and I
imagine the Archifoon (31-tone generalized keyboard electronic
organ from Holland) and Scalatron were patented. Erv Wilson has
two patents on his keyboard, a generalized pattern suited to the 
_"12, 17 and 22-tets"_.  William Lyman Young patented a "decatonic  
keyboard" for 24-tet.

Certainly, tuning tables may be copyrighted.

Interestingly enough, the 24th root of 3 itself has been patented by 
James Heffernan ( No. 15,561, in 1906,in England) under the
title "An Improvement in Musical Instruments." Heffernan was
a "Supervisor of Inland Revenue (it figures, a Tax man) and worked 
out a notation and provisional keyboard for this scale. His patent 
specification even has an excerpt from "Mozart's Twelfth Mass-Gloria" 
in his new notation. 

The octave in this tuning spans 15 degrees and has only 1188.72 
cents. His system is thus a shrunk 15-tet with a step size of
79.25 cents rather than 80.

I would imagine that by now this patent has lapsed into 
the public domain, so I wouldn't hesitate to use it. At best/worst,
a suit for infringement would gain publicity for both parties.

PS: Greg, the more microtonal, xenharmonic, allotonal, etc. music
you can play the better, sorry I can't get your program out here
on the "Left" coast.
