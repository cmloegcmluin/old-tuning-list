   I'd have to think hard to try to imagine what tone rows would sound like on
the appropriate harmonics of tonic/dominant/subdominant-related pitches!  That
probably wasn't his intention though, I suspect.  

   It would not surprise me though, if the unequal step sizes and simple
whole-number-ratio underpinning of that tuning, would risk ripping atonality up
by the roots (pun again intended).
