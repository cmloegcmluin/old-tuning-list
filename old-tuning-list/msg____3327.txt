Subject: re: more Partch comments

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

In Tuning Digest #784, Neil G. Haverstick advertises a book on 12tet
theory, in a forum dedicated to non-12tet tunings and his tape for
(I lost count) the 6th or 7th time:

>If you want to brush up on your theory in 12 (gasp), this could be the
>book for you. My address is: Box 150271, Lakewood, Colo., 80215...
>also, still plenty of cassette copies of my CD, "The Gate" left,
>featuring hot rod blues/rock in 19...only $5.00...perfect for stocking
>stuffers foe the little microtonalist in your life...Hstick

In Tuning Digest #792, Neil G. Haverstick seems confused:

>Haverstick here...just a brief addition to the Partch comments which
>have been on the forum lately...I don't have a clue why Partch should
>be treated any differently than any other composer...am I missing
>something here?
