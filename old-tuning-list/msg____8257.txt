Paul asked me to post his reply to my "Old Bone" post, while he tries to
sort out his MIME problem...

I don't think a chain of 3 (or even 2) 11/8s results in an acoustically
recognizable interval; if the individual 11/8s are tuned well enough,
that's all that can matter. And even if the resultant interval were
acoustically recognizable, we're talking about the case of modulation
where the interval occurs not as a simultaneity but with the tones
seperated over quite a span of time. So level 3 consistency in the
context of modulation is a double irrelevancy.

The 11/8 in 72tET is 1 cent off. If you really think this discrepancy
makes certain modulation effects impossible, you should (a) perform some
listening experiments and (b) remember that it was Partch himself who,
when told that JI made ordinary modulations impossible, allowed the
22-cent syntonic comma "correction" which would not be noticeable enough
to impede the sense of modulation.

Sure, but as far as strictly defined notated pitches, didn't he stick to
43? No room for transposed tonality diamonds on 11 identities.


Third irrelevancy: I consider plain old, simultanoeus-sounding, level-1
consistency to be important for ETs up to 34, and possibly 69. Beyond
that, the tones are less than 1% different from one another, so in most
musical circumstances what you have is tantamount to a continuous
spectrum of pitch.
