Subject: Basic Just Intervals?

From: "Just Intonation" <justintonation@hotmail.com>

I've decided to begin my explorations of just intonation by 
"translating" some of my previous 12TET compositions and tone rows (I'm 
a proponent of what I call "neo-serialism") into just scales, so I 
thought I'd better make sure I'm calling all the intervals by the right 
names, and have the correct just equivalent intervals and cents values. 
So, I thought I'd better run my little interval table by you all, in 
case I made any mistakes:



   12TET       Just    
   Semitones   Ratio   Common Name      Cents Value



    7           3/2    Perfect Fifth    701.96

    5           4/3    Perfect Fourth   498.04

    8           8/5    Minor Sixth      813.69

    4           5/4    Major Third      386.31

    9           5/3    Major Sixth      884.36

    3           6/5    Minor Third      315.64

   10          16/9    Minor Seventh

    2           9/8    Major Second

   11          15/8    Major Seventh

    1          16/15   Minor Second

    6          45/32   Tritone          600.0



   Please let me know if I made any mistakes, or if you have some of the 
missing cents values. Thanks.
