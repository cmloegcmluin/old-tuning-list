Subject: Re: Ancient Greek Modes

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Dear Ben,

May I suggest "Greek Musical Writings" I and especially II- Harmonic and 
Acoustic Theory edited by Andrew Barker, Cambridge University Press, 
1989.  It contains just about all there is.

Schlesinger comes under fire for making conclusions regarding tuning 
based on the aulos, but fails to take in to acount reeds, embouchure, and 
air velocity.  Aulos tuning is implied in the title of the book that she 
wrote, hence the problem.

Of most interest to me was discovering the secret meeting between the 
Thracian kitharist Timotheus, just banned from Sparta for polluting music 
with new notes, and Euripides, living in a cave on Salamis Island in 
self-exile.  Euripides was not only a class-A tragedian, but he was 
composer of music for his own works, and was known to favor the 
enharmonic genus (e.g. the oldest of the genera, and the one to contain 
"quartertones").  This meeting signals the beginning of microtonal music 
cooperation and mutual understanding.
