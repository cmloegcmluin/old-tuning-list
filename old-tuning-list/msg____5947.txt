   That strikes me as surprising (although I'm not suggesting that they're
lying of course).  It seems surprising because of the answer to your second
question:

   Harmonic partials come from vibrating systems with uniform and elastic
vibrating media bound by two immobile "nodes".  The most obvious example is
a vibrating string, the two nodes being the nut (or fret) and bridge.
Those systems can set up "standing waves", which resonate strictly at
harmonically-related frequencies.

   I would think that most seismic waves would not fit this model at all,
but instead would vibrate along the effectively infinite expanse of the
crust of the Earth.  But getting back to musical instruments...

   Systems that produce nonharmonic partials don't follow that scheme at
all, an example being a drum head.  Systems that produce NEAR-harmonic
partials almost always have that essential scheme, but the perfection of
one element or another is compromised.  High-register piano strings for
example, are not entirely harmonic because they are very stiff, and thus
compromise the elasticity requirement.

   Most wind instruments somewhat compromise the absoluteness of the nodal
points.  The vibrating medium, air itself, is an almost ideal (in this
sense of the word) vibrating medium unlike the high-register piano string.
The physical basis for this is somewhat more complicated to describe, so
bear with me here:

   In wind instruments, the wave is easiest viewed as an air-pressure wave
traveling along the axis of the tube, the nodes being the points where the
air-column is exposed to the open atmosphere.  At those points the air
pressure can't fluctuate very much.  Why?  Because, unlike within the tube
where the air molecules' movement is restricted to the confines of the
tube, any attempt to pressurize them in the open atmosphere will be
immediately thwarted by their freedom to move so as to disperse that
pressure.

   The compromise to the absoluteness of the nodes occurs right at the
opening to the atmosphere.  It's called an open-end effect, and it gets
even more complicated with woodwind-style toneholes.  The air molecules'
movement isn't sufficiently unrestricted to form a pure node until they get
somewhat outside the tube.  How far outside the tube they have to be
depends upon a great many factors including the geometry of the tube (e.g.,
its diameter and whether it's cylindrical or conical), the amplitude of the
wave moving them, and yes, the frequency of that wave as well.

   For a purely cylindrical tube like you'd find on a fife, the effective
nodal point is fairly predictable, lying outside the end of the tube about
0.6 times the diameter of the tube.  A flared bell like brass instruments
have tends to blur the exact placement of that nodal point much more than a
simple cut in the tube.  The effective vibrating length of the air column
therefore varies a bit more between harmonics in brasses than in woodwinds
or strings.

   But, as I've mentioned before on this list, I have quite a bit of direct
experience with the tones of orchestral instruments forced to exact
harmonic overtone structures, and I think it's important that these are -
in the big scheme of things - fairly subtle differences.  They are of the
magnitude that distinguishes a good simulation of an instrument from a bad
one, not ANYWHERE NEAR the sort that distinguishes, say, a flute from
trumpet.
