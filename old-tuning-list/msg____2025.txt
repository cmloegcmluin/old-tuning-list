Subject: Bach's Tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

To follow up on  my last posting:  Anyone who has ever been to Thuringia 
where the Bachs's stem from will notice that there is no "equal" anything 
to be seen.  Architecture in the area suggests an aesthetic of 
well-temperament.  

Secondly, Andreas Werckmeister did not merely "list" well-temperaments, 
he focused on what we now call "Werckmeister III."  This tuning was in 
practice long before it was catalogued by Mr. Werckmeister.  Werckmeister 
I is simple just intonation and Werckmeister II is quarter-comma 
meantone.  I own an unpublished English translation of Musicalische 
Temperatur (1691) made by Elizabeth Hehr and given to me by Mark 
Lindley.  The bulk of his writing is on III - which displaces four 
quarter-comma flattened fifths to include C-G, G-D, D-A, and B-F# - 
leaving all other fiths pure (3/2).  Contrastingly, Werckmeister IV, V, 
and VI only receive a page or two apiece.

Thirdly, I believe that the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier was 
as evidenced by Barnes illustrative of key intervallic diversity.  Though 
a second book would be moot if not to emphasize the homogeneity of 24 
identical keys in contrast.  A composer picked a key accordingly, some to 
mirror meantone preferences, some to mirror equal temperament realities.

For eight years I have presented a Microtonal Bach radio show every 
Christmas Day for 4 hours on WKCR-FM Columbia University in New York 
City.  It is part of a week-long all-Bach series of broadcasts.
The music staples include: Ton Koopman's Brandenburg Concerti in 
Werckmeister III with the Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra, various 
performances of Bach's early work The Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue by Igor 
Kipnis and others (e.g. Eugenia Earle) in Werckmeister III, and the 
Coffee Cantata in quarter comma meantone, among others.  There is a grand 
difference in this music...but it is subtle for many other listeners.  For 
many others, they listen in every year, regularly.

For example, The Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (which is the 
most consonant minor key in Werckmeister III) is much more "chromatic" in 
well-temperament.  Its many diminished 7th chords which act as pivot 
chords for modulation contain different sizes of minor thirds, and so 
their inversions take on new meaning.  And the fugue which is semitonal 
is striking with its big-small semitone alternations.

Should we really disregard J.P. Kirnberger's assertion that to change the 
key of a composition into a distantly related key is to damage said 
piece?  Keep in mind that Kirnberger did more to promote J.S. Bach than 
any of his kids.  It is thanks to Bach's student Kirnberger that the 
world even has the Brandenburg Concerti.  Yale University Press 
publishes his *Art of Strict Musical Composition*, designed to present J.S. 
Bach's essential theories, as well as his own.

Manuel, once again, could you post this to the harpsichord list.  Thank you.
