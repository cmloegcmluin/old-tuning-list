Subject: Re: Thai tunings

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

The figures that Graham cites from Manuel's table are probably taken fromHelmholtz-Ellis, which are monochord measurements of single instruments
that had somehow made the long searoute to Europe. I would thus take these
figures with more than a grain of salt, and would by no means accept these
figures as a definitive representation of Thai practice. In my most recent contacts with mainland southeastasian musical instruments
(Thai, Cambodian and Laotian), I have heard very accurate 7-tet tunings. In
fact, I spoke last Winter with a Laotian Khaen maker and player (now living
in France) who said that he used a digital tuner and that he had both sent
cassettes with his instruments and tuners back to Laos where other makershad duplicated his tunings or adopted the use of the digital tuners.
