PRC stands for "People's Republic of China."  While it is
sometimes necessary to be selective in what you buy (some
folks have commercialized "traditoional " Chinese music in
various ways) there is still a good amount of music frmom
China that is the real thing.  HMV in Hong Kong carries a
lot of it, but I would imagine the selection in US record
stores would be more spotty.

Best,
