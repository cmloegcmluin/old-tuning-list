Ok, I was merely saying that the connotation of "pure" has a meaning in
tuning theory. Maybe I misread your statement in that.

including "pure". If you take every word literally, life would become
difficult.

Languages are constantly changing. It happens all the time that words get
new meanings, sometimes they even get the opposite meaning of what they had.
