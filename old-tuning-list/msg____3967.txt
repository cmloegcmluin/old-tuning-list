Well, if it remains in one tuning, I don't know how many different tunings 
you'll be promoting. Anyway, if you mean 5-limit JI, my first suggestion 
would be Helmholtz's 24-tone temperament, which is indistinguishable from 
just intonation and allows just playing in many different "keys". If you 
mean 7-limit JI, I'd suggest a meantone tuning: a circle of fifths of 697 
cents each -- then you will have 28 very pure 7-limit tetrads as well as 18 
major and 18 minor keys playable without any of the difficulties of true JI.
