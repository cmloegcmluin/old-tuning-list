I think there was talk of it about 8 months ago or so.  Anyway, in addition to
the two items you mentioned, I'd like to add two more

1)  The ability to use several different tuning tables at once, perhaps as
many as 16 but at least 4, with table assignment on a per-MIDI-channel basis.

2)  Sample assignment (in the case of sample-based synthesis) by nearest-to-
sampled-pitch rather than by note number.  This is the most sever problem with
using Proteuses for tunings that don't map 12-tones-per-octave.  For example,
31-tET on a Proteus causes the lower tones to be pitch-shifted way above their
sampled pitch, and higher tones to be shifted way below their sampled pitch,
making most sounds totally unusable for most musical purposes - they just
sound too bad for anything but getting a rough idea of what the tunings sound
like.  There.  I've ranted.
