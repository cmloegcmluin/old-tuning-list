Subject: Non-12 Film/TV scores, a correction

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I spoke with Erv Wilson and he said that the instrument played by
Emil Richards in "KLUTE" was a set of 31-ET (not 22) "song bells"
built for him by the late John Brock. Each of the 'bells' was mounted
on its own resonator and the ensemble was arranged in a 19+12 pattern
(analogous to the 7+5).

Erv also reminded me that Richards played glissandi on his 
(Erv's) 22-tet "Transceleste" metallophone in the TV series 
"Kung Fu."
