Subject: monochord

From: Erik Nauman <ENauman@TrevorDaySchool.pvt.k12.ny.us>

I built a monochord quickly and cheaply with an 18" pine 2x2, a
nickel-wound guitar string (low E), 2 eye screws, an autoharp tuning
peg, and a wood screw. You can sort of imagine how it all goes together,
but some tips are that I threaded the guitar string through its own bead
to creat a loop that went around the screw. I put the screw in the side
angling down and the eye screws just in from the top (long) ends and
angled out so that the string would have more or less 18" of resonating
length. The autoharp peg was opposite the screw, also angled down. I
divided and marked the board in 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5...1/9 lengths and
when plucked on a table for resonance each of those nodes produces a
very clear partial up through the 9th. WHen the board is held to my ear
I can clearly hear through the 19th. Excellent project!
