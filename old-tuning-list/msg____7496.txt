Trying to understand the 12ET overtone Schoenberg discussion - Are we saying
Schoenberg recognized that the tempered scale's ratios were a bit off, but if
you pay attention to the overtones created by the tempered scale (which will
reflect the natural harmonic series), you can include that aspect into your
music?  Was he trying to connect the equal tempered system to the pure
intervals you would associate with just intonation?  And would Partch's
response be - that's nice, but why don't we just start off with the pure
ratios?
