Subject: Weird Nightmare album

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

I got the following information from Roger Merrick of the British
Harry Partch Society about the album "Hal Willner Presents - Weird 
Nightmare - Meditations on Mingus," Columbia COL 472467-2  
Time 74m 18s
 
The review says in part:
 
"What is the connection between Charles Mingus and Harry Partch? None, 
appears to be the answer, apart from the musical inspiration of Hal Willner - during the development of the project, Willner says he constructed some sequences of Native American music and 'rhythms of the street and gangland.' 
He then used this tape to construct a framework of Mingus compositions that had, he says, a 'similar feel.' "
 
"Thumm then serendipitously exposed Willner to Partch's music and 
instruments. Amazingly, Willner made the connection between Native 
American and 'street and gangland' (read - hobo) music right away, and 
began to want to incorporate the Partch instruments into the Mingus 
work. Mingus had explored the ethnic and subcultural origins and 
derivation of his music, so he had in that respect a similarity to Harry 
Partch (I wouldn't want to overdo this)."
 
"The music is by Mingus, not Partch, and not all our members will want 
to venture into it, but the Partch instruments add considerably to the 
atmosphere with their tonal presence, and sometimes feature strongly in 
arrangements."
 
"The musicians featured will surely bring the attention of the more 
intrepid of their followers to the music of Harry Partch - featured 
musicians include: Keith Richards, Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, 
Elvis Costello, musician to the world, Bill Frisell of Material, Robbie
 Robertson of the Band, Leonard Cohen, Dr John, screaming woman Diamanda 
Galas, Don Alias, Bobby Previte, Bernard Fowler, Marc Ribot, ex-Void-Oid 
Robert Quine, and, as they say, many more who are possibly as well known, 
but not by me."
 
"Not every 'famous' musician plays a Partch instrument - Charlie Watts 
and Keith Richards don't, but for examples, Elvis Costello plays Harmonic
 Canon, Marc Ribot Marimba Eroica."
 
"Partch instruments featured on the album  are: Chromelodion II, Cone Gongs 
(no indication that the Gourd Tree was used), Bass Marimba, Marimba Eroica,
 Harmonic Canon, Cloud Chamber Bowls, Surrogate Kithara, Crychord, and 
Diamond Marimba."
 
"Danlee Mitchell and Dean Drummond are credited with special thanks, 
implying the instruments were from Dean's collection with Danlee's overall 
approval."
 
"But the Partch instruments are not being used here merely to spice up 
a jazz album, they do affect the intonation and harmonies, and they 
contribute substantially to the atmosphere of the disc. I recommend investigating this disc - not maybe everyone's cup of musical tea, but 
in many ways valuable - it is, so far as I know, the first project of 
its kind to use Partch instruments; Partch is profiled highly. It 
introduces (?) some interesting and adventurous musicians and their 
audiences to Partch's work. If it is difficult to get this disc - and it 
took us a while: we were informed it had been deleted, which isn't the 
case - rather, it has been recently issued, and hasn't fully percolated 
its' way through the catalogues - we can order it for you."
 
 
For more information on the BHPS, email  Roger Merrick at 
<100550.2266@compuserve.com>. There is also a WEB page, but I don't
have the URL.
 
BTW, this should appear in Digest # 666? Does that mean that xenharmonic 
music is satanic? "Enquiring Minds want to know."
