I'm back.  I should be able to help.  I should also be able to help Grady
with pdfing the Wilson material.  Results may be slow, however.  I suggest
Paul and Kraig mail me off the list to discuss.

In the meantime, I'll post an open question.  I have just purchased a PC
(Intel) and have not yet decided on a soundcard.  So: If you could have any
soundcard, which would it be, and why?  I think I would prefer a PCI card
to an ISA one, but I'm flexible.  I would also prefer to have one card do
both MIDI and digital audio, but I'd be willing to get seperates if there
was a good reason.  Lastly, I'll want something that works well with Scala.
 Let's pretend cost is no object for now.

At first I thought about the Turtle Beach Montego, but after reading
Manuel's post I said, "No Way!".  It seems the only other board to offer
Soundblaster compatibility is the Soundblaster Live, but I swore I'd never
buy another Creative product.  But is the Live actually a decent card?
Does anybody have one?
