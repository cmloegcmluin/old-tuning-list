It's not the materials, it's the way that things vibrate. Here's an 
oversimplified description.  A pure vibration like that of a tuning 
fork is a simple smooth "sine wave" of frequency 440, say.  A more 
"jerky" vibration of frequency 440 is mathematically equivalent to the 
combination of smooth sine waves of frequencies 440, 880 etc., the 
bigger the component of the overtones, the more complicated is the 
resulting waveform and the "richer" is the sound.  The way that the 
vibration is set up determines what sort of waveform it gives, and 
hence determines the timbre.

Basic books on musical acoustics will explain this with diagrams, much 
better.  perhaps the Just Intonation web site has book references?
