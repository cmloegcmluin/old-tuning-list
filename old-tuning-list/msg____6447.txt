Subject: Tuning database

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@InterLinx.qc.ca>

All this talk about traditional instruments has given me an idea. We
could have a web page about who (member of the tuning mailing list)
plays what instrument. We could divide the discussion into private
e-mails (by intrument.) This is easy to do with the CC option of e-mail
(carbon copy). If you do not know how it works, just hit the "reply to
all" button. THERE WILL BE DETAILLED INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE
YOU WILL RECEIVE. An archive of all the discussions could be kept, and
if there is a demand, articles could be written.

 If you are interested, send me your infos (instruments played/owned,
tunings used, geographic location and anything else that you want to
share, like year of birth-- on the internet, we do not know who you are)
at mailto://kami@interlinx.qc.ca

Maybe this won't work : in that case, it would still be interesting to
keep a database about who's who (it could be made necessary to send you
infos when you first subscribe to the list. Is this a possibility?) And
why not maintain a "Clarinet technique page", "Basson fingering page",
"Steel guitar tuning page" (this one already exists,
http://www.wco.com/~quasar/articles/just_e9.html ). Why not an orchestra
site, with links to the instruments? A page only has to be written once,
but can can updated whenever we get new ideas.

So send me a e-mail, your ideas are welcome! If we all do this together,
maybe there will be more than just ten persons reponding. It's up to
you!

REQ: Could someone send me the Yunik and Swift article about 19TET
trumpet? I did my own research on the subject, but I have not seen this
article.

PS : I notice that there is no info on JI-chord progressions and
wandering tonics on the 'net. Maybe we could put ours ideas together on
this subject as well? (maybe later)
