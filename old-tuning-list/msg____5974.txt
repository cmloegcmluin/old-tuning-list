Subject: syntonic and skhismatic notation

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

I mentioned some of this before in a post about quartertones
that should have been in TD1153, but wasn't.

I class all just intervals and approximations thereof based
on syntonic meantone temperament using the letters t, s, r, q
and p for major seconds, minor seconds, augmented unisons,
diminished seconds and "commas" respectively.  The syntonic
comma p5 is dimensionless in meantone temperament.  I usually
think of the dimensions of intervals in terms of q and r.  I
now use the term "demisemitone" for intervals with dimensions
of q and r-q, although I would rather call them quartertones.

A chromatic semitone is a kind of r, and an enharmonic diesis
q.  For 7/4 to be an augmented sixth, a septimal comma has
dimensions of q.

In terms of fifths, octave reduced, t=2 steps, s=-5, r=t-s=7,
q=s-r=-12.  The # symbol means "raise this note by r" and the
/ symbol can mean raising by q.

These symbols are consistent when 0<=q<=r, where 0 is a unison.
This is true for all meantone temperaments where the fifth
is between that for 19tet and 12tet.  When the fifth is
sharper than 7/12 oct, a skhismatic approximation is better.
12tet is the scale that is both a syntonic and skhismatic
meantone, and can be defined as such using Fokker's method.

The symbols / and \ can then be added to a 12 note piano roll
view to denote boosts of q from the following scale:

            r  s  s  r  s  r  s  r  s  s  r  s
          C  C# D  Eb E  F  F# G  G# A  Bb B  C'

There is a one to one mapping between this and the standard
staff notation.  The symbols # and b can still be used if
they are found to be convenient.


Over the past couple of days, I have extended this idea to
syntonic intervals using Greek letters.  The major tone is a
kind of tau, and a diatonic semitone is a kind of sigma.  Then,
rho=tau-sigma and pi=sigma-rho.  In Pythagorean terms, sigma's
are apotomes and rho's are limmas.

A minor tone has dimensions of tau-pi or 2rho.  A chromatic
semitone has dimensions rho-pi, and an enharmonic diesis is
2pi.  The syntonic and Pythagorean commas are both pi's, and I
have also defined the septimal comma to be a pi.

The piano roll view can also be adapted to skhismatic scales
with / and \ denoting boosts of pi from a scale like this:

 rho rho sigma rho sigma rho sigma rho rho sigma rho sigma
C       D         E     F         G       A         B     C

The capital letters here name keys rather than notes, as
the standard note names do not work with skhismatic scales.
This is compatible with the syntonic version in that the
same scale will occupy the same positions in both notations,
but with different modifiers.  They are also compatible with
12 note keyboards.


One day, I intend to implement these views in software, so
this isn't all abstract.  It is also easier to get dynamic
tuning to work with 2-D than just scales.

Now, does anyone know of a 2-D approximation (linear
temperament) that covers 22tet?  Approximating the
enharmonic diesis (7 0 -3)H and syntonic comma (-4 4 -1)H
to be equal doesn't work.  If it did, it would cover 12, 22,
34 and 46tet.  It is, incidentally, significant that these
are all even numbers.
