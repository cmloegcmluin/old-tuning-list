All-
	To those of you involved in the Forum CD project, I have a 
message from Neil Haverstick. Neil apologises for the slowness of 
delivery of the CDs. Neil has shipped out four boxes of CDs so far, but 
remember, he has to assemble each CD himself, and that's about a thousand 
CDs. If you need to talk to him, he should be online again Sunday evening 
(I am loaning him a computer Sunday) and he will be communicating with 
one and all. Scholz, Taylor, Sanford and Morrison's CDs have all been 
shipped, Neil has two (?) shipping checks, and the remainder will be 
shipped as soon as the shipping is received and the CDs assembled.
