To the contrary. As I said a generating function does NOT have the
numbers of the sequence as a result. It depends on the numbers. It 
is similar to the Z-transform. The generating function is unique, for
a finite or infinite number of integers. Of course a function can be
notated in an infinite number of ways but that doesn't alter the
function.
