   That is definitely NOT true if you're taking those ratios relative to
the tonic rather than to a C in particular.

   If you're taking those ratios relative specifically to a C, then that's
as true as for any other tuning mode.  By that I mean that there will be
variations in what tuning for any particular tone is best for the
particular situation.  Comma differences are probably the most celebrated
example of this.  In some contexts tuning the D to 10:9 relative to C makes
more sense than 9:8.
