Uh, abs(sum) seems like a bad idea, since pos. and neg. errors cancel out in 
the sum. As for sum of abs(errors), you certinaly get different results from 
least squares. Using the three intervals in the 5-limit triad, the best 
meantone tunings according to absolute error have fifths of 696.57842466 
cents (unweighted) and 696.57841680 cents (limit-weighted). I normally don't 
use so many decimal places but you need to to see the difference between 
these two! Maybe you only thought you got tunings you already had!
