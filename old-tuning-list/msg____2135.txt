Paul Hahn's adaptation of the square root algorithm to the Nth root certainly works:

    Answer := Of_Number;
    loop
       Delta := (Of_Number / (Answer ^ (N-1))) - Answer;
       if abs Delta <= Answer * Epsilon then
          return Answer;
       end if;
       Answer := Answer + Delta / N;
    end loop;

But as he points out:

For doing by hand, the simplest way is find the square root of two, then the  
square root of that, then the cube root of that.  This converges to 10  
significant digits in a total of 12 iterations (4 for each root).  The direct  
12th root approach also converges in 12 iterations, but the latter requires  
calculating 11th powers 12 times, while the former only requires finding 2nd  
powers 4 times.

Either way, the algorithm is not inherently difficult.
