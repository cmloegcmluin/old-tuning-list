A few other list participants have responded to the historical
issues, and I will defer to them, not being an historian. I do
think that just as practice differs from theory today, the two
have probably differed through history. Even if your 3-limit 
history is correct regarding practice, we live today, and 5 
is important now and has been for hundreds of years. 

I will hopefully live tomorrow as well, and 7, 11, 13, 17, 
and 19 are important to me too, so my music will reflect 
this. My ear doesn't seem to want to do anything with 23 or 
above right now, in fact, it kind of ignores 13 and 17 and
jumps right from 11 to 19. This may be because I keep 
hearing 12tET minor thirds which are within 3 cents of 19/16.

I don't know where you get the data for statements as
general as this. All I can say is that I can find examples 
of comprehensible melodies without simliar tetrachords.

Neither ascending melodic minor nor harmonic minor have 
similar tetrachords. Each of these has modes which have 
also been used. Maybe you wouldn't considered these diatonic?

Here would be cases, like I-ii-I, which I would say are 
implying more than 7 pitches, or at least a different
7 pitches than say I-IV-I, which is what I meant when
I said that much diatonic music implies more than 7
pitch classes and will be played that way when the
ear is given sway.

I dare say that your own bias is clearly showing here, and 
that Helomholtz was probably more observant than you and I 
combined. I suppose one could rerun the experiment now
to get another opinion.

Thanks for the math references.
