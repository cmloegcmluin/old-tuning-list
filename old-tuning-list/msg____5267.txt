Subject: Re: tunings on the march

From: Joseph  Downing <jdowning@mailbox.syr.edu>

Aline mentioned general interest in tunings.

About a month ago I did a presentation to the Central New York piano
tuners guild along with our University Piano Technician, Bob Lee.

Bob had tuned a Yamaha upright to my specification (lots of pure
intervals, including 7 and 11 limit intervals), and he spoke on the
problems he encountered and the procedure he used.  (I speak in ratios; he
speaks in cents.)  Then I played a couple of pieces I had written for that
tuning.

To my surprise, EVERYONE loved the presentation and was really impressed
by some original non-equal temperament thinking.  I was very encouraged by
their support.  A couple even wrote cards after the event with some
further thoughts.

Joe Downing,
