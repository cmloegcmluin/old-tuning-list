The creative process, in my experience, is highly unpredictable.  Some
works begin with a fascination with a particular chord or progression.
Others with melody that comes to you and won't go away.  Others still
with a concept which in turn dictates form, then you construct themes,
and so on in good, anal-retentive top-down fashion.  (Not very often,
though.)  Sometimes several unconnected fragments float around in your
mind, then one day you suddenly realize they go together.  You just
never can tell how it's going to happen.  Well, I can't, anyway.
