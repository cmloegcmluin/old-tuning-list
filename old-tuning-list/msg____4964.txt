In typical situations, that is not the case. The vibration of the string, 
however tiny, usually determines the frequency of the feedback. Well, it 
determines a fundamental frequency, of which the feedback is a harmonic. One 
nice effect is obtaining feedback at a particular harmonic, then bending the 
string, whereupon the origianal mode of vibration, now at a different 
frequency, usually dies away and a new one fades into prominence. The 
magnetic characteristics determine the preferred frequencies, but the string 
does have to participate in the mechanism to a very small extent.
