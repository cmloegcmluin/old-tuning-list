Subject: Haverstick and "God".

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

Personally I subscribe to particular religion, yet I find it
interesting to read Hstick's posting about "Creator" makes me
reconsider John Harrison's writing that he was searching for
a tuning which was suitable to praise his "God".

There must be some connection here with Einstein's comments about
God and dice.

Maybe the "ghosttones" to which I have been listening were the same
Harrison heard.

Since Harrison's biography is still in t6he best-sellers in UK,
some readers may be interested to read all his original
writings about music and tuning.

We have put them up on our new website run from Tokyo.

I understand that they are also being translated into Japanese there.
