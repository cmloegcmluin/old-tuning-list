*Blush* thanks so much!  I actually had nothing to do with the ASR-10 since
I haven't been here that long, and have passed this message along to Bill
Mauchly and the others who made it what it is today.  

While I'm here though, there's a new synth we've just announced called the
MR-rack, which is the first synth shipped with my Midi Tuning Standard
implementation.  Both the bulk dump and note-change messages are supported,
and the product's been tested with JICalc on the Mac and Midi Tuning Wrench
under Windows.  These messages affect a single user tuning table in RAM.
Thanks to David Doty and Carter Scholz for assistance and feedback during
its development.  The only bad news is that the ASR-10 can't get an MTS
retrofit.  

One area which has been crying out for the note-change ability is the middle
east.  The keyboards there have a series of buttons which tune the
corresponding note down a preset interval.  We hope to have third-party
support for this later in the year.


regards,
