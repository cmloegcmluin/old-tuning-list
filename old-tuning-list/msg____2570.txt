Here are some organ recordings:

Two on Harmonia Mundi France, played by John Butt:

JS Bach Triosonatas (907055) - unidentified Well-tempered tuning
J Cabanilles (907047) - 1/4-comma meantone

The complete organ works of Buxtehude played by Harald Vogel feature 
historical organs, most in historic tunings.  vol. 7 has a modified 
1/5-comma meantone, including a technical description of that system.
(Dabringhaus und Grimm MD+G L 3427)

Two recordings of the Fisk organ at Wellesley college, in 1/4-comma 
meantone:  

JD Christie, works of JP Sweelinck - Naxos 8.550904 (budget - a bargain!)
B Lagace, various composers - Titanic Ti-207

Here's one a a restored historic Mexican organ, temperament described as 
"8 just thirds" - so likely 1/4-comma meantone:  Dominique Ferran, organ 
at Tlacochahuaya:  K 617 AFAA K 617049

Most of these would be available from the Organ Historical Society:

PO Box 26811
Richmond VA 23261
tel 804 353 9226
fax 804 353 9266

There are many others - tell them what you're looking for and I'm sure 
they'll be glad to help you.
