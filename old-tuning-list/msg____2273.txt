Brian's mention of Modernism makes me think of a question about the arts in
general:  Is this the first time in history when we've managed to progress past
the current "modern" era into something recognizably different ("post-modern")
without ever coming up with a name for the "modern" era?  

   The theory behind this question of course is the ... abstraction at least ...
that every era - Baroque, Classical, whatever - was viewed as modern until they
thought up another word for it.
