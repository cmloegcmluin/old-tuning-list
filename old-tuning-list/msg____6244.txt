   My address is 13036 Staton Drive;  Austin, TX 78727-4513.  I'm about to
head off on vacation until the end of the month, so take your time in
placing those orders!  Please!  But I shall fill them in November.

   Paul Rappoport reminded me of a complication, an obvious one in
hindsight:  Those of you who are not from the US would have a rather nasty
time getting a hold of US postage!

   Tellya what:  How about if you folks enclose instead approximately $1.24
worth of money (cash) from your country?  I may exchange it or not;  I
confess that I have a (strange?) curiosity about money of various
countries.  I guess I see it as a little glimpse of one piece of day-to-day
life in that country.  But you US tuning listers please just send me a
SASE.  Thanks.

   By the way, I welcome any of the rest of you who have DAT decks to help
out in filling tape-copy orders.  I can copy the DAT master for you.  Lemme
know if you're interested.  Thanks.
