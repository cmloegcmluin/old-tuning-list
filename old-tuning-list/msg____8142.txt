Subject: Gary's 10TET's, 7/4, no name it

From: Rick Sanford <76122.2237@compuserve.com>

Gary:

Aside from the 7/4 biz, do you know of a generalized term
for scales using only two size of intervals one after another
(like the traditional whole step, half step octatonics)
and their derivatives? I'll cc John C. who might steer me
right.
