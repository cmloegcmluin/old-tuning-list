Subject: unsavory habits of the musical intelligentsia -- or --
  the 12-TET musical elite have a point, but if they comb their hair
  properly, it won't show
---
The savage dictatorship of the concert-hall-and-conservatory
musical establishment, which Greg Taylor is pleased to
imagine the product of my paranoid delusions, will brook
no deviation from the totalitarian musical status quo.
The clearest example of this Orwellian and ruthless
state of musical conformity is of course the string
quartet.  Offhand, there's no reason at all why 4 fretless
string instruments couldn't perform in any scale desired--
19-TET, 31-TET, 53-TET, 11-TET, the free-free metal
bar scale, the Bohlen-Pierce scale, or any other tuning.
Naturally, any string quartet that gets handed such a score
will burn the offending sheaf of music paper and
bury the ashes.  Naturally, all string players have been
programmed to perform in 12, only 12, always 12, forever
12.
Another example of ruthless 12-TET tyranny is the computer
music scene. Given the opportunity to explore any possible
musical scale, any possible set of harmonies, any conceivable
set of melodic pitches, the contributors to Confuser Music Urinal
choose to...explore 12 tones per octave. (For the most part. There
are a few exceptions. Dashow, Schottstaedt, a few others. All
have been ostracized and marginalized for their troubles.)
This is reminiscent of aged Devil's Island convicts who, being
set free of their ball-and-chain, still drag one foot and move
with snail-like gait.  In this case the musiKKKal establishment has admirably attained its implicit goal of brainwashing
all & sundry into the use of 12 tones per octave: indeed, the Red
Chinese during the Korean war could hardly have hoped for better
results with U.N. prisoners.  Such a state of mindless (musical)
conformity would bring joy to the heart of Stalin, and
send Hitler to sleep with an ecstatic smile on his face.
After composing some pieces recently in the Greek enharmonic 
genus for an upcoming performance in a San Diego experimental
music club, the true bestiality of the current musiKKKal  status
quo really began to become clear to me.  Think of it: for hundreds
of years, it would have been a simple matter to retune a harpsichord
or a piano to the Greek enharmonic...yet *no one* did so.  This is an
case of conformity unexampled in the history of mind control.
Such machine-like zombification would make even Mussolini cringe--
yet, somehow, we accept this grotesque and obscene lockstep
mentality as "the progress of music."  ("From 12 to 12...in the beginning
was 12, and 12 was the Word, and the Word was 12..."  One's puke-
meter pegs. One's gag reflex kicks in. And *still* it continues...)
The enharmonic genus is, as Ralph David Hill has pointed out, "almost
the most beautiful of all the Greek genera," and simple to 
obtain on a 12-TET retunable instrument.  No note would need to be
retuned by more than about half a semitone.  Yet not a single composer,
not a single adventurous soul, dared to compose a piano sonata in
the Greek enharmonic genus.  Too, with 12 pitches available, more
than one key center could have been explored: yet this was apparently
too terrifying an extremum for generation upon generation of
composers to contemplate.
In the words of the Outer Limits episode "O.B.I.T.": "O savage 
despairing planet!  When we come here to live, you will fall
without a single shot.  Enjoy the few years left to you..."
Naturally these brutal and disgusting facts will be prestidigitated
away by gtaylor and his cronies with yet more smoke and mirrors,
reason upon  complicated and  unlikely reason why the iron fist of 
12 equal tones doesn't *actually* rule inside the velvet glove of the 
musiKKKal concert-hall-and-conservatory establishment.
