   Uhmmm...  Well, that may perhaps be true of SOME plucked strings, maybe
perhaps violin or viola pizzicato.  But I don't think the same can be said
for many, and possibly the majority, of plucked strings, including 'cello
and bass viol pizzicato and guitar.  

   I say that because I personally have decomposed and then additively
resynthesized those tones with partials forced to be strictly harmonic. 
What ever would posess me to do that?  Because for a long time that's all
my program would do (analyze down to the nearest strict harmonic).  I had a
regular test suite of about two hundred woodwind, brass, orchestral and
plucked-string, bell, piano, pipe organ, wood-bar, and metal-bar
instruments, and timpani.  I ran those sounds through the program
frequently as I developed it.

   It's very easy to hear that, in being forced to strict harmonics, the
strings (excluding the high register of the piano), woodwinds, and brass
suffered only slightly, whereas the characters of the those percussion
instruments, were vastly altered.  

   The enormity of the difference for the strings (including the plucked
strings), woodwinds and brasses I would characterize as slightly greater
than the sort of thing that distinguishes a bad guitar (for example) from a
good guitar.  

   Another way to characterize the difference is that the unaltered and
pure-harmonic tones were nearly indistinguishable from each other on the
Mac's built-in speaker, although the strictly harmonic timbres had a
crusty, buzzy, robotic quality when played back over big speakers in
44.1KHz 16-bit stereo.
