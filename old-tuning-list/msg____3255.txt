Subject: Inharmonic spectral analysis

From: muslp@luxor.latrobe.edu.au (Larry Polansky)

Another interesting program for spectral (track)
analysis, although unfortunately only available for
a Mac PPC, is Chris Langmead's PAST, written as an
M.A Thesis here at Dartmouth, using Lemur-files
as analsyis bases, and freely available on the Web
(via Bregman's webpage: http://music.dartmouth.edu).

Chris did a lot of thinking about the notion of
"harmonicity": template matching, equal spectral distribution
and so on, and came up with some interesting analysis techniques. His
thesis (also on his website) explains a lot of the theoretical
justifications behind some of his decisions, and is well-worth
reading if you're interested in the kinds of things Brian is
talking about.
