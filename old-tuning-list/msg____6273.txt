Subject: Re: notation again

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Respectfully, I must disagree with Paul on this.  I think the issue of
notation must be seen in a description/prescription context.  While
describing "just" relationships in ratios and other extended notations is
certainly justified both pedagogically and conceptually, it gets
in the way of performance realization.

In a prescriptive score for performers, a legend-page which indicates
ratios being used and the philosophy behind them would be invaluable.
Real time music in cents can make full useage of professional music
notation training as it is now practiced.

The very fact that the ear is the true judge of "just" intervals would
seem to mitigate against labored ratio calculations in notation.  Once
appraised of the "just" aesthetic, performers easily conform to cents
notation.  Rehearsal time is no longer for microtonal parts done in cents
notation than for conventional notation.
