With all of Brian's finger-pointing and name-calling, much of which is 
warranted, it is amusing that he never fails to prove himself the biggest 
pseudoscientist of them all. Observe his "proof" that there are no live 
acoustic music performances anymore. Since I have performed in and attended 
more than a few of these, and the total quantity of music contained therein 
is of the same order of magnitude as the recorded music I own, I must 
conclude that his reality is different from my own. Nothing new here. 
Moreover, I would be quite happy in a world where live acoustic music was 
the only music we had. Technology need not be limited to electronic means.
