I did some WEB browsing yesterday and discovered that there is
a 30 minutes VHS video of Cris Forster performing on his unique
set of custom-built instruments in JI. Cris played in the Partch
Ensemble and has constructed a an orchestra of instruments
according to his own designs. Among these are the Chrysalis,
a large rotating, circular harmonic canon,  and several tuned
percussion instruments. See XH 7&8 for color pictures and
description. 

Anyway, the video "Music Wood Steel & Glass" is available from 
Richard Gaikowsky, One Way Media 1035 Guerrero, San Francisco 
94110. The  URL is http://www.slip.net/~richgaik/cris.html.
I haven't seen it, but it sounds very interesting. 

I think a great program of tuning videos might consist of this, Partch's 
"Dreamer ," and the Lou Harrison video (which, alas, I haven't seen 
either).
 
I also came accross Arnold Dreyblatt's "Animal Magnetism" in JI.
described at http://kochint.com/Tzadik.html.

Brian asked me to post a question about CD-ROM generating software
for a proposed intonation disk. Is there a greater need for MAC or PC 
compatible CD-ROMs and is there any way to convert one format to
another without having to completely do the CD over? (I'm not sure
I understand the problem well enough to be asking the right question.)

I got email from a Thomas J. Burh at SonicArtz Software concerning 
microtonal notation for a software project his company is doing. 
I referred him to Paul Rapoport (and LYME) and suggested he join the 
list and read the archives. Any other suggestions? His email address is 
insiders@MTS.Net.
