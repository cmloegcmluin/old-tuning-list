Subject: Classifying Tunings

From: TONY SALINAS <salinas@lgu.ac.uk>

I can see two clear groups of tunings:

A) The ones using fractions as ratios

B) The ones using roots to determine the ratio

Meantone and XVI to XVIII century western tunings (non 12ET) 
would be in between I suppose???

I'm still missing out of this two groups Gamelan and Javanese
tunnings. any others???

According to the Maths applied on the tuning, how would you 
classify them???

Anyway, I don't think mathematics are always used to calculate
tunings (like specially with Gamelan / African tunings ), so 
probably is better to classify tunings historically within
the different cultures.
