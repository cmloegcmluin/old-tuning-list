From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	A friend of mine has a TX81Z for sale for $150. If anyone is 
interested, please write me at

jstarret@math.cudenver.edu

Also, I have tried several times to change my Tuning Forum address from 
the tiger computer to the math computer to no avail. Can anyone advise me 
as to the procedure for switching addresses on the forum?
