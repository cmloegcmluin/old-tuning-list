Will do. Your activities look interesting.

Maybe the ICMA mailing list (computer music) or the algocomp list
(algorithmic composition, mostly electronic). I'm not aware of
mailing lists devoted to contemporary acoustic music. Let me know if you
need more details.

You can contact Paul Berg from the Royal Conservatory in The Hague.
His email address is koncon!paul@relay.nl.net. The postal address is
Koninklijk Conservatorium
Juliana van Stolberglaan 1
2595 CA Den Haag
The Netherlands

I don't know much about chamber ensembles. Below are some resources for
electronic music.

The IPEM in Gent, Belgium:
The WWW homepage is http://next.rug.ac.be/ 
IPEM stands for "Instituut voor Psychoacustica en Elektronische
Muziek". There are descriptions of activities and compositions,
articles, short biographies of composers, soundfiles, etc. It's best
to browse during office hours (GMT+0100) since some pages might
otherwise be inaccessible.
