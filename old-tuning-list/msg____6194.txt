Even tho my comment was about Just Intonation, he continues...

I believe equal-step tunings are best used not as immitations of just
tunings, but as what they are: equal-step tunings.  Why?  Well, for 22
pitches per duple you can afford an amazingly powerful 7-limit just tuning.
But if you choose to use 7-limit JI as the compositional model and tune your
instrument to 22 equal, then your reply was appropriate.

And Mr. Erlich had replied...

>Whoops! I lost your train of thought.

Crucial to understading my train of thought was reading the "pop in
microtones" message to which I was responding.  The jyst of this message was
that "pop" musicians sometimes play music written in 12:2 equal with pitches
outside of that tuning.  My response was on behalf of the fact that this is
almost always the case in any style of music, and that the main point of JI
is the expanded resources it offers for composition.

I said that performers of the future will play music composed in JI with
notes outside of the tuning it was written for, without changing that this
music will be more powerful than music composed for 12 equal.  I was trying
to make clear the difference between a compositional model and the nature of
performance.

After depriving performance of the role that Johnny Reinhard (author of the
original "pop in microtones" message) tried to give it, my last statement
was to point out that it can be appreciated for what it really is.

I hope this was worth it,

Carl
