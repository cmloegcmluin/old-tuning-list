Manuel:
>>Hmm, I think that's not entirely fair. I can't speak for STEIM but I
know Sonology because I've worked there. The Institute of Sonology is
not an independent institute but a department of the Royal Conservatory.
Do you expect a state conservatory to become entrepreneurial? That's not
a matter of attitude. A school's task is education, using tax money for
unsure investments is not. I understand that you would have liked it
otherwise though. 
=======================
I also would not expect the Institute of Sonology to invest in making the
Clavette more available. BUT, it would not be unreasonable to expect the
Institute to allow me to sell the original version of the Clavette at perhaps
10% above cost, and then split the 10% with the Institute, since according to
Dutch law they hold all patent rights to it. Such an arrangement would cost the
Institute nothing.

But no, despite ever-tighter budgets, such an arrangement holds no interest.
Yes, I suppose the Institute would not get rich off of it, but even if they got
a few hundred guilders they could buy something worthwhile for the studios. 

Maybe the disinterest has to do with the politics of receiving government
subsidies. I suspect similar thinking is at work at STEIM.
---------------

Nevertheless, I highly value the experience I had at the Institute, and do
appreciate the very low (by US standards) tuition rate for foreign students, and
the teaching of courses in English. And, of course, I know of no other place in
the word where a student can take a course in designing his own MIDI controller,
with a good likelihood that his design will be built...
