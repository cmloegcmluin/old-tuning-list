No. I was just illustrating how the adjective ''microtonal'' would be
useful
in talking about this particular tuning, which - assuming Reinhard is
refering to Cairo-sytle arabic art or pop music - uses a pythagorean tuni=
ng
with =

schisma-equavalents of ratios of five and often some added ratios of elev=
en
to get approximate quarter tones, all used, however, only in melodic
intervals
greater that semitones.

While the source collection contains _microtones_, the sub-collections
actually used in real music do not. However, the intervals actually used
can be efficiently described as varying _microtonally_ from reference
intervals.

I don't want to drag this out any longer, but the word ''microtone'' =

clearly signifies something _small_, and to adopt a new definition that
is so broad as to erase this basic significance - indeed, to follow
Reinhard, to have no significance at all - is contrary to common sense,
and,
from the viewpoint of someone who would like to promote the use of a
variety of tunings, counterproductive.   =
