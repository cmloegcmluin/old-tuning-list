Subject: NYC music

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

A friend just told me about some music he recently heard in a club in New
York City somewhere -

flute & leader - Ali Ryerson
guitar - Joe Beck
bass - Jeff Fuller
drums - Danny Gottlieb

My friend knows I'm a bit of a Joe Beck fan, and also about my interest 
in tunings. He reported:

> Last night, there were a couple duets between him and the flute 
> player, with her on alto flute and him playing some alternate-tuned 
> guitar -- a dark and very full sound.

My friend is an excellent musician so his report on the alternate tuning is
very likely accurate.

Jim
