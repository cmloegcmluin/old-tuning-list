Dear Adam,

If you define JI in 12 tones per octave and they are based on the the 
better resultion of 12 ET than you should not be surprised if a listener 
hears very little difference.  My wife Mayumi uses only 12 notes in JI, 
but they are all made up of ratios of the 13th harmonic.  This provides 
for the melodic angularity you are seeking, while enriching the harmony 
with sure and meaningful relationships, and a fresh sound to boot.

Surely a restriction of only 12 keys is still a restriction and this can 
be overcome by writing for another instrument (or more) playing with the 
restricted keyboard.  The additional instruments can play additional 
microtones.  Wyschnegradsky's *Meditation* has the cello (or in my case 
bassoon) playing quartertones and sixthtones against a conventionally 
tuned piano extremely effectively.

My belief is that 7-limit JI is to organically harmonic to provide the 
melodic angularity wanted - everything blends.  11-limit is able to 
present "grey" sounds, a quartertone dimension, and opens up directional 
melody.  But why stop there?
