.wav files include
Format (8 or 16 bit pcm)
Sampling rate (11025, 22050, 44100 Hz)
Number of samples
Format (8 or 16 bit pcm, adpcm, etc.)
Channels (mono, stereo)
File size (total megs)

I prefer .wav to .au, but for my taste they take to long to download.
I have been impressed with Shockwave audio streaming. The player software 
is a Netscape plug-in, and after a couple of seconds wait while the 
buffer loads, real time digital audio begins. Although it is not .wav 
quality, it sounds better than Real Audio. The speed of download may 
make it suitable for musical "thumbnail" sketches. The Shockwave sample 
site is
