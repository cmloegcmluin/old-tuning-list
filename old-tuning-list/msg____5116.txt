Interesting thoughts, John.  

   The idea that we'll have problems advancing science in the future also
strikes me as surprising.  It's certainly true that most of the problems
we're facing are harder than ever before to solve, as the difficulty in
funding the Super Collider shows, but there are also some problems that
aren't much harder, and much of the technology with which to solve them
keeps improving exponentially.  

   I'm also very optimistic about how that technological edge is helping
out in the Arts.  It's really exciting to think not only that nearly
anybody can routinely hear CD-quality sound, but also it's now amazingly
easy to produce it ourselves.  And we don't even need to press it on a CD
either!  

   But probably most important to me is the ability to retune instruments
capable of fairly expressive music performance in two seconds.  As we
Texans are allegedly fond of saying, "Yeeehaaah"!
