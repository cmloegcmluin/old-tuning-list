   I think that's great.  Perhaps somebody out there might want to start
one another for equal temperaments, or well temperaments.  I recommend
however, that however many more specific lists there may be, people should
not refrain from posting about JI here on the main Mills college list as
well.

   Along different lines, I've long thought that a Newsgroup would be a
good way to go for this sort of thing (so that you can keep the threads
straight)
