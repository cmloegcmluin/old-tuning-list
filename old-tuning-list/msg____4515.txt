   That is absolutely true, and is indeed a very important characteristic
of the piano timbre.  That also probably helps to explain why a
properly-tuned piano tends to have slightly stretched octaves in the upper
range.  

   And to that I'll add that it's not only less, but vastly less for the
harpsichord, and also for virtually every other stringed instrument as
well.  The fact that the highest strings have vibrational characteristics
that begin to depart from string acoustics toward those of metal bars, is
pretty much unique to the piano.
