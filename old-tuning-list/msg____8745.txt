There's an excellent book expoloring the role of the
subjective in defining musical perceptions of consonance
and tonality, "Tonality in Western Culture" by Richard
Norton, 1984. [sorry I don't have the publisher info]

Many thanks to Margo for really fleshing out something
that I only alluded to in order to make a point.
