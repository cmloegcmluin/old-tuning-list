Easier?????? to what precision????

Thanks for your enthusiasm David.
In the morning, we shall be flying out from Hawaii to London to do just that
----- produce some more commercial music. I shall be working with James
Sanger (arc-angel), and again we should be using a combination of acoustic
and sampled/electronic audio to produce LucyTuned music.
Certainly some of the LucyTuned Lullabies may have been written in 12tET;
they are so "old" that who knows how their tunings originated. Sung?

Everything James writes (usually on guitar) is sure to be LucyTuned.
All his guitars are LucyFretted, and he has playing that way more
than ten years now. James is left-handed, and all his guitars have
had to be custom-built or modified.
Many of the sounds that we have used are produced acoustically or with
electric LT guitars and effects; the problem which we have constantly
encountered has been pitch resolution on pitch-changed samples.

It has sometimes been necessary to make seperate samples of each note to
improve the limitations of current technology.

(Suggestions for better tuning precision methods are welcomed)

Referring back to the posting about MIDI pitchbend, I have used pitchbend,
with one note per channel for many years, yet have never been satisfied
with only 64ths of a semitone. Such crude resolution results in beating
"mish-mash" compared to what can be produced with guitars or other
acoustically based instruments.

This is another call for tuning enthusiasts to "PLEASE NAG THE
MANUFACTURERS to implement the MIDI TUNING DUMP!!!!!! on new gear."

I have put some new gif diagrams (forgive my HTML) at:

This site also has links to WIO from Tokyo, and from there to arc-angel,
in UK, where you can hear some of James's older tracks [including bits of
his celebrated - "Spikey Message"].
