Gee folks, I dunno: am I coming off like a pimp on this?  :)

>Mr. Szanto writes....

Carl's first error: "Mr. Szanto" is my dad (even in my mid-40's!) -- I'm
just plain Jon...

>I've got all 4 of the CRI's, and they sound fantastic!  Congrats on the A->D
>transfers!  Thanks a bunch!  I hope you get royalties, as CRI says they're
>selling like hot cakes!

Sincere thanks for the kind comments. I did the best I could on the A->D,
but I will say that the sonic nature of some of those very old tapes amazed
me when I listened to them the first time. The physical nature was a
different matter (old splices breaking left and right). A lot of people
have asked me about the project, and in a short while I'll have an article
on the web site about what putting together all that material entailed.

For the obsessed only, of course.

>No Delusion of the Fury, tho?  CRI don't have it, and I don't remember
>seeing an enclosure for it.

Well, there are still rumors that Sony, who inherited the Columbia archives
(read: bought them out) intends on re-issuing it. If the CRI sell well
and/or get a lot of notice they'll probably smell $$$. In any event, they
own the master, not the Harry Partch Foundation, one of the only times that
happened to Partch.

BUT.......... On Enclosure Four, Philip Blackburn has released the film
that Madeline Tourtelot did of the "Delusion" production in LA. Sonically
it can't remotely compare with the recording, but on the other hand you can
see to what extent HP wanted musicians to get involved in a piece in the
film. Well worth getting, even if you have to convince friends and split
the cost or something.

If Sony is listening: get off your butts or I'll bootleg the thing...

On other notes:

1. I have replied to Dan Wolf about the Erickson stroke rods.
2. I just came across info that Kraig Grady will be performing in LA at a
percussion convention (on their "Music Research [read: wacko] Day") next
Wednesday. It may not be public, but if anyone is interested I'll track
down the info and post back to the list.

OK, I've got to go put on my SuperFly coat and sell some CDs on the street
corner...

Cheers,
Jon
