The advantage of a connectionist network model is that you only need a few
input tones to get a reasonable response. The different activation levels
of the key units
is what indicates the key. So if C has the highest activation then F and G
come next
to that as in the circle of fifths. The network consists of layers with
nodes for tones,
major chords, minor chords and keys. The links have a weight and are
symmetrical.
An interesting conclusion of the article by Barucha is that even though the
weight
of the links between source chord C major and its parent keys F, C and G
are equal,
the parent keys are not activated to the same degree. It is in decreasing
order:
C, F, G which are the keys in which the chord is on the tonic, dominant and
subdominant.
This in accordance with the hierarchy of harmonic functions in music
theory.
