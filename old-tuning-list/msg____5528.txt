Subject: RE:Equal Divisions -- of What?

From: PErlich <AAM/AAM/PErlich%Acadian@mcimail.com>

David,

I agree that JI makes for the best harmonies in most cases. There are 
exceptions, such as a pentatonic scale played as a chord, where a meantone 
tuning changes the three thirds from Pythagorean to near-just, without 
giving up much consonance in the fifths. But yes, melody and harmony often 
have contradictory implications for tuning.

All I was saying is that if you use frequency units as your units of 
measurement, the geometric series gives you equal temperament.
