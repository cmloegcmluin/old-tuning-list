Well, here's the algorithm for calculating consistency level (perhaps I
should say _an_ algorithm):

consistency_level(ET_number, limit):
	max <- 0
	min <- 0
	FOR loop <- 3 TO limit BY 2
		exact_steps <- ET_number * log2(loop)
		error <- exact_steps - round(exact_steps)
		IF error > max THEN
			max <- err
		ELSEIF error < min THEN
			min <- err
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN integer_part(0.5 / (max - min))

Roughly speaking, find the interval within the limit which has the
greatest error, divide that error into half the stepsize, and truncate
to get consistency level.  If you simply leave off that last step of
truncation, you get what might be considered a fractional consistency
level.
