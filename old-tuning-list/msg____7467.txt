Subject: Re: Over-/Undertone series

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

Just to clarify the point of the controversy over undertones:

The question is not whether or not it is possible to create a harmonic
series of pitches _under_ a "root", as the converse of those over it,
with which we are already very familiar -- as Joseph Downing (and Partch)
described, it can be easily demonstrated.

The controversy is over the concept of the undertone series _as an
acoustical phenomenon_ -- and this is something that, as Max Meyer
pointed out clearly, cannot exist.

I think this was the main confusion I had over the whole argument for a
long time.
