I personally have not seen anything published on the subject, and I'm kind
of surprised, because trombone seems like a perfect instrument for just
intonation.

As a T-bone player myself, I know that we routinely make minor adjustments
to the slide position as we play, depending on the surrounding notes of the
chord.  And I've been thinking about working out the math for what slide
positions might be needed for, say, a 5-limit just intonation piece.

I suppose whatever notation is used can be a modified version of the "slide
position number" notation - 1 through 7.  Something like "This Eb is in '3rd
Position', but that Eb is in 'Long 3rd Postion'".  It'll be a little odd,
'cuz the conventional slide positions get further apart as you go toward 7,
and they're sort of "equal temperament" based.

What other mailing list did you post your inquiry to?  Let me know what you
come up with.  Good luck!

P.S.:  The "list processor" that the TUNING list is on may have recently
gone "on the blink".  I haven't received any new mail from it for a few days.

P.P.S.:  How are things up there in Cambridge?  I might go to my 20 year MIT
reunion in 1999.  I'm sure things have changed!
