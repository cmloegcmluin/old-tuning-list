   I don't personally own one, but I've heard been considerable discussion
about the K2x00 on the list and from a friend who has one.  

   Without a doubt, it doesn't have a generic tuning table capability by
which each key of the keyboard may be retuned to any arbitrary pitch. 
(Most of the Ensoniq line does, by the way.)  There are instead three
separate mechanisms that you have to learn and apply separately.  The going
answer seems to be that these things are easy:
1. Tuning the interval between all adjacent keys equally to any multiple of

   2 cents.  All adjacent keys 
2. Tuning the twelve notes of each C-C octave identically to just about 
   anything.  Switching off between several such tables with SysEx messages
   is also easy.  These are strictly 12-tone tables though, and repeat only
   in exact octaves.  
3. Using a Max patch to retune every note on the fly according to what
might
   be called a "sample and hold" controller.  (It memorizes the
most-recently
   set value to ... I think it's something like controller #25 ... and you 
   can then adjust a note's pitch based upon that.  It's sort of like pitch
   bend except that it has no effect upon notes already playing)

   Doing #1 to a finer resolution is also possible, but much more
difficult.  That is what you'd want if you wanted, for example, to map
19-tone equal-temperament linearly, meaning note-for-note/key-for-key
across the keyboard, mismatching octave boundaries of the tuning with
octave boundaries on the keyboard.  

   From what I've heard, I doubt if there's any way to tuning a K2x00 like
Partch's Chromelodeon, which uses an irregular spacing between keys
spanning across an octave of 43 keys.  Or similarly, my mapping for 88CET
tuning, wherein I use a linear, key-for-key/note-for-note mapping except
that I omit the G#/Ab key from that setup.  (Or to put it another way, the
gap between all pairs of adjacent keys is 88 cents, except that G#/Ab key
is tuned to the same pitch as its adjacent A key.)  That mapping would
probably not be possible on the K2x00, except through external computer
assistance (#3 above).
