Incidentally, Plomp and Levelt did find that even with sine waves, in-tune 
octaves were more consonant than their out-of-tune neighbors. This has been 
attributed to second-order beating, which can be thought of as beating 
between the lower tone's summation tone with itself and the upper tone. 
However, at a low enough volume, second-order beating should disappear. I 
vaguely remember reading that it doesn't disappear, which was taken as 
evidence for periodicity pitch detection.

Plomp and Levelt's main results need to be taken seriously in any theory of 
consonance. K&K (two Japanese workers -- I can't remember their names) 
calculated consonance curves based on Plomp and Levelt's results. K&K 
assumed some typical harmonic series, and assumed (I think) that total 
roughness is the sum of the individual sine-wave roughnesses calculated 
according to P&L's results. They derived the usual consonance/dissonance 
relations by defining consonant intervals as local minima on the graph. 
Clearly, with inharmonic timbres, none of the usual consonant intervals 
would appear (except the unison), and a whole new set would arise. This is 
the basis of Sethares' work, I believe.

However, there is an additional component to consonance that is a somewhat 
separable issue. It goes under many names, such as "spectral fusion," 
"rootedness," etc., and is the degree to which the entire set of sine waves, 
belonging to more than one complex tone, approximates a single harmonic 
series. The harmonic series is privileged in our auditory system as the 
information is "compressed" into a single pitch (the fundamental, even if it 
is physically absent) and timbre (which represents the relative amplitudes 
of the harmonics). For instruments with harmonic timbres, this phenomenon 
explains the difference in consonance between "otonal" and "utonal" chords, 
whose roughness (if equal to the sum of the roughnesses of the individual 
intervals) is identical, but whose consonance is not. For minor vs. major 
triads, this may be arguable, but for complete 11-limit hexads, it's pretty 
easy to hear that the utonal chord is less consonant. This is because the 
otonal chord forms a single harmonic series, while the utonal chord can only 
be considered a harmonic series if four- and five-digit harmonic numbers are 
allowed. Tones with completely inharmonic spectra may be formed into chords 
that have the same degree of roughness as an "otonal" or "utonal" chord of 
harmonic spectra, but this other component of consonance will favor both of 
the chords with harmonic spectra over the inharmonic one. This is because 
any pair of tones, even in the utonal chord, forms a harmonic relationship, 
and, particularly for the perfect fifth, the set of harmonics resulting from 
the pair of tones forms a single harmonic series (in the perfect fifth, this 
harmonic series is 2/3 complete).
