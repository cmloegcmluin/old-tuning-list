Subject: Triadic or tetradic infill?

''   As for why there's a historical preference for using triadic rather

have been regarded as dissonances that need to be resolved to triads.  ''

Yes, but this still begs the question of why this particular preference
appeared and not others. I was trying to argue from first principles about
the infill phenomenon using a spacing model, not an intonational model (for
which Pythagorean and 5-limit just intonations would provide a familiar and
convincing argument for western music through the early baroque). For later
music, where sonorities akin to 4-5-6-7 become common place, it is striking
how these are left in the _dissonant_ category and required to _resolve_.
Even vernacular musics tend not to end on seventh chords. Either this is
evidence of a deep conditioning from common practice music, or there is
some other mechanism at work.  Possibilities which spring immediately to
mind include (1) a problem with ratios of seven (or their tolerable
approximations), or (2) a spacing function (which I have called variously
"compacting" or "optimizing"). Any other ideas?

Another possiblity - and one purely from an intonational standpoint - is
that the ET approximation is bad enough to shove the seventh into a
_dissonant_ category and to demand resolution. In this case, however, the
resolutions of seventh chords occuring in real, existing Just intoned
musics - chorales or Barbershop quartets - retain the avoidance of sevenths
in final chords (except for special effects). Is this just conditioning
from the the familiar temperament? Does anyone know of a way to test this?

(Unfortunately, music that I am familiar with using justly intoned seventh
chords (Partch, Johnston, Young, Leedy, my own) is often highly ambiguous
about the whole issue of _resolution_. I do detect some tendency to respect
harmonic series spacing in the voice leading, but this is as yet more of an
impression than an established statistical fact).
