   I don't think I've heard that question, as such, having been raised
before.  There is of course no dirth of psychoacoustic theories aimed at
explaining sound perception across all humans as a whole.  Some seem more
successful than others.

   But certainly each of us finds certain tunings more interesting than
others.  It's kinda hard to know how much of that is genetic and how much is
environmental.

   Perhaps a place to start would be to look for any volume peaks or troughs
that might or might not exist in the individual's ears across the audible
frequency spectrum.
