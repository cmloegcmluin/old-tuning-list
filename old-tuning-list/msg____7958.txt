Subject: Yamaha FB-01/TX-81Z

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hello,

I'm about to get an FB-01 and am looking for information on microtuning 
it.I've looked about on the 'bahn and came up with zilch.The TX-81Z seems 
easier to use for microtuning.I've got a couple of other things on my 
shopping list (Finale & a Roland GI-10 MIDI guitar convertor),so I've 
really got to squeeze the most out of my very ltd. budget.Anyone think I 
should just get a TX-81Z  to make life easier ? I use software synthesis 
for high quality/precisely tuned sounds.

Some of you use the FB-01 ,non ? Could you tell me if there is info out 
there somewhere and if you know of a Mac editor for it ?

Thanks in advance,
Drew
