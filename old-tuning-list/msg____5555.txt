Dear Pieter,

Below is a short description of the modes you were in1quiering about. For
the purpose of this explanation I am using 12tone Equal Tempered tuning to
make it easier.

An Equal Tempered major scale is composed of : semi-tones (one chromatic
step) and tones (two chromatic steps) in this order:

Scale Degree #   : 1   2   3    4   5   6   7    octave 
Distance between :   t   t   st   t   t   t   st

tne
stmi-tone

There are 7 modes based from this scale. If you start your mode on Degree #:
1 -you have an Ionian mode
2 -Dorian
3 -Phrygian
4 -Lydian
5 -Mixolydian
6 -Aeolian
7 -Locrian

So, an Aeolian mode is a major scale organized starting from the sixth degree.
ie. 6,7,1,2,3,4,5,octave (t,st,t,t,st,t,t).

A phrygian would be 3,4,5,6,7,1,2,octave  (st,t,t,t,st,t,t)

Again, the above is all based on the western equal tempered major scale.
there is a wealth of other world scales, each of which contain various modes.

Stay tuned,

Thomas Langley
