Funny that you should mention Hendrix here...

Are you relatively new to the list, Robin?  Sounds like you missed
the big "Jimi Hendrix Chord" debate back in April.  My position was
that Hendrix himself was one of the great unsung microtonalists,
albeit without the mathematical/ theoretical angle.  He had the
technique and the ear to make audible what was in his head.
(Duane Allman played great microtonal stuff too.)

(Check the Tuning List archives on John Starret's website and
the program notes and audio examples to my "Hendrix Chord" piece
on my site  -- I'm not interested in re-opening THAT can of worms
again here).
