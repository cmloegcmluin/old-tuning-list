Subject: Forum CD

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I just got my copy of the tuning forum CD that Neil Haverstick 
produced, and it is really strong! Every contribution is good enough for 
radio play, and as an album it holds together. Thanks to Neil (who is 
currently offline due to hardware problems) for all his hard work and to 
Stephen James Taylor, Warren Burt, Bill Sethares, John Loffink, Richard 
Sanford, Denny Genovese, Ernie Crews, Bill Alves, Carter Scholz and Gary 
Morrison for the fine music. I'm sending some off to local radio stations 
(and Doctor Demento for my cuts) and I would be really surprised if we 
don't get quite a bit of airplay.
