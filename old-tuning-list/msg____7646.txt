I've thought about the matter of prime integers vs odd integers re the
contribution of successively higher ones to musical harmony, and it seems to
me that intervals based on the successively higher odd integers each
contribute something unique in the way of a musical sound effect on a
listener, so that the effect of a 9/8 musical interval, say, is, from a
psychological listening point of view essentially different than a 3/2 musical
interval.  While there is the octave equivalence effect for intervals
differing by a factor of 2 or 2 to the nth power, so that a 10/4 interval is
psychologically harmonically more or less the same as a 5/4 interval, there
isn't such an equivalence effect for intervals related by factors other than
2.

	I can see that from the point of view of building up a musical system, once
one included 3-ratio intervals in the system, one would want to use combined
intervals, adding one such interval to another - e.g. creating a ninth by
adding two fifths, etc.  But from the psychological perspective, I believe the
ninth really has a different character than the fifths from which it is
constructed by addition.
