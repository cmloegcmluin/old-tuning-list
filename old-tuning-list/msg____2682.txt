Subject: Newband concert details

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

A week or so ago David Beardsley mentioned a concert by Newband on the 24th.
Here's some further details as published in my local paper:

    Newband, artists-in-residence at Purchase College, perform works by
    Harry Partch, Dean Drummond and Anne LeBaron at 4 p.m. Mar. 24 in the
    Music Building on the campus.  The public and families in particular
    are invited to attend an open house from 3 to 6 p.m. where they will
    be able to touch various instruments designed by Partch, such as the
    zoomoozophone, bloboy and cloud chamber bowls.  Free admission and
    refreshments.  [914] 251-6887.

I'm planning to attend.  I'd be happy to meet other folks from the Tuning List
there as well.

John
