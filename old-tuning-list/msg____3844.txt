Subject: notation

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

Thanks to Johnny Reinhard for his reply on using cents notation. It is 
true that in using other signs as accidentals in front of notes you may 
get notes with conflicting directions, e.g. an up arrow but a down comma 
of some other sort, or two of one and three of another.

But I don't see this as a conflict. Nor would I see it as precipitating
working out cents values. In JI music that is truly harmonic, each pitch
may come from another, so that the signs in front of the notes show this
relationship, and therefore how to tune the note, including whom and what
to listen to most closely in the ensemble. Certainly Ben Johnston's 
notation works this way, despite whatever problems it may have. It 
suggests to performers that they are in a sense performing relationships. 
Cents notations to me suggest performing fixed values out of context.

If Johnny finds that performers have to calculate cents, then I wonder 
whether performers faced with a cents-notated score for JI have to 
determine relationships, since no one performs numbers (i.e. cents 
values) in an absolute sense.

In the only piece of JI I have had performed, the (amateur) performers
were indeed initially confused by the signs, wanting to know just how flat
or sharp certain notes were. But what does "a little sharp" or "quite
flat" mean when all you want is certain notes to be in tune? I taught them
to hear the harmonic structures, I suppose with some success, and kept the
cents values for the preface to the score, for those interested. This
turned out to be fairly close to 0% of the performing group, even
including a math teacher. 

But I emphasize I have not had a lot of experience with performers in JI; 
where I live there is little opportunity for this kind of thing.
