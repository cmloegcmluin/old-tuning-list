Subject: MetaPhys... and Phys... trend.

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

This is NOT an April Fool's comment for John non12, just an
observation.
I have noticed that sometimes yesterday's metaphysics have become
reflections of "tomorrow's physics".

There must be a better way to say that, which I'm sure someone will
understand.
The observation being that often ancient ideas (vaguely) or
metaphorically become patterns which are evident in later discoveries
in physics. eg. The idea of an atom?
OK now tear the idea to pieces-like a pack of howling wolves!
