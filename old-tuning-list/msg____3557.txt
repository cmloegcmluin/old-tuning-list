Crap.  The only IRCAM composer that I know who has any knowledge of Forte
is Magnus Lindberg and it has been about 10 years since he has used any of
Forte's theories (and even then they were rather loosely interpreted).  The
other two American theorists are unknowns in French composition.  Pitch
class theory is truly an American gadget which has little, if nothing, to
do with French musical sensibilities.  The French are much more concerned
with harmony and/or the objet sonore (as is evident in the music of
Messiaen, Dutilleux, Boulez's "Music Today", the French "spectral school"
and by the importance of the "spectral school" with the current generation
of young French composers) than with Forte/Rahn/Morrison (Robert Morris,
perhaps?).  Webern serialism peaked very early in the 1950's in Paris
(simply compare the sound worlds of Boulez's Pli selon Pli (late 50's) to
Structures I (early 50's) and then compare either to Derive I from 1984).
I can't think of one working "house" composer at IRCAM who can remotely be
described as being a post-Webern serialist.

McLaren needs to get out more.  For an outfit that has "marginalized itself
nearly out existence", IRCAM seems to be doing quite well having just
opened (June 1996) a rather large and impressive extension to their
building in Beaubourg.
