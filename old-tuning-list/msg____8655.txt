In response to Lydia Ayers;
    I'm sorry if i was understood as not being for the conference idea.
In fact as you remember when you were in L.A. it was discussed and I
hadn't forgotten about it. As someone who has presented shows since the
early 80's I would be happy to help Bill or whoever would like to put
together on here. I would take on the whole mess if I had backing which
I don't. My comments were to help an understanding of the situation. We
are not a "movement" in the same way as the impressionist or the
dadaist. In fact Breton rejections of others as not being "surrealist"
is closer than I wish it was. All in all, I find it funny and enjoyable.
I would love to meet you all in person and find a big room and let the
ideas and music fly. Frankly I don't find universities the "neutral"
environments they wish they are. They should be involved but not to the
exclusion of those who feel uncomfortable to their basic assumptions.
After all, this music exist both in and out and the conference should
reflect that. From knowing Erv since 1975, I would guess he would rather
present his work outside a university. But that is just my assumption.
LET US PROCEED. PICK A MONTH THEN TWO WEEKS AND LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
