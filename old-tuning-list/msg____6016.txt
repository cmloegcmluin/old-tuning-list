There is a difference between a fifth and a twelfth, so there is
also a difference between an octave and a unison.  In this case,
we're talking about the difference between an augmented unison
and a minor second.  Augmented octave indeed ...

I introduced the term "demisemitone" for this concept, to avoid
confusion with other meanings the word "quartertone" has
acquired.

The definition only applies to syntonic meantones.  24tet, as
opposed to 12tet, is not such a scale, so a demisemitone can
be defined as 1 step.  In general, I would define a demisemitone
as the approximation of the septimal comma.  This is consistent
with 7/4 being a subminor seventh, and an augmented sixth in
a syntonic meantone.

Yes, fine with me.
