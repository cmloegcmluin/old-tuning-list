   Speaking for my own experience, I don't perceive there to be any sort
of absolute cutoff point either (beyond thus and so ratio).  Again
speaking in generalities, as the ratio becomes more complex, it becomes
more difficult to attribute an audibly intuitive meaning to.

   Also, simpler ratios seem to claim more space around them than more
complex ones.  By that I mean that anything within something on the
order of 75c of a simple ratio like an octave seems to be perceived as
an approximation of an octave.  But the "claim zone" as I've called it
in the past, of a more complex ratio, such as 5:4 is much narrower. 
400c (13c sharp) clearly seems to be an approximation of 5:4, but you
don't have to go much sharper than that before it starts sounding more
like a flat 9:7.

   Or once again, that's my own personal experience anyway.
