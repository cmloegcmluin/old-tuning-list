Jorgensen's argument that ET could not have been tuned in the 18th
century is specious.  I've addressed this issue in another posting, so I
won't take up more band width by repeating myself.  Although my own ET
is not that hot, I know other people, and some of them are on this List, that
can tune good ET by ear.  Is it acoustically perfect?  Maybe not.  Does it,
for all intensive purposes, pass as ET?  Absolutely.

BTW: When I was Eric Herz's tuning assistant at the New England
Conservatory in Boston, I routinely witnessed him tuning very good ET by
ear (on a French double) in 20 minutes.  People that say that it can't be
done don't know what they're talking about.  Including Jorgensen.
