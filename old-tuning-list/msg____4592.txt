Hm, I don't know if I'm willing to accept that. I'm not an historian like
some participants on this list, but I doubt that a strong case could be
made for proving that back in the beginnings of human melody, the pitch set
determined the melodic choices rather than the other way around. You know 
what I mean? I suspect that conceptions of fixed pitch sets are tied more 
with the practicalities of instrument making than pure melodic thought. I
will not deny that "choosing pitches from a set" is now a popular method
for generating melody. I wish to move away from that and free melody (again?)
from the restrictions of pre-determined pitch sets. If you could sing, or
play any pitch on demand, what melodic inspiration might be enabled by this?
Extend that to harmony as well.

I'm not sure quite what you mean, those 3 intervals don't add up to 4/3.
I'd like to hear your piece though. Is there any way I can?
