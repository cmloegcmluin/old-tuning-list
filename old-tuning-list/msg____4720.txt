Subject: Cheesecake?

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Tunors,

This may not be the GREAT BREAKTHROUGH everyone has been waiting for, but
has anyone else noticed the tv ad for Philly Cream Cheese, about a woman
whose fantasy comes true: to have cheesecake anytime she wants it, mornin',
noon and night?

The background music for it is done on a synth(s) *definately* not in
12TET.  I wouldn't for a minute confuse it with any great theoretical
tuning setup (probably  just a 'weird' tuning patch), but considering the
fact that the rest of the commercial isn't really *wacko* or anything, it
*is* pretty amazing they got it past the usual up-tight ad execs.  Funny
stuff.  A hundred bucks to the first listee who reports back with the name
of the jingle-meister, paid directly out of the burdgeoning coffers of the
C. Lucy Fund for Enlightened Intonationalists.  
	
                                   {as Letterman says, "It's a joke."}

Oh, why couldn't it have been about that *other* form of cheesecake...

Cheers,
Jon
