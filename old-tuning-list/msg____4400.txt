Subject: Re: Systematizing Tuning Again

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I certainly agree with Matt Nathan, and Varese, and many others that
limiting oneself to a finite set of pitches is not necessarily good for
the music.  The full sonic spectrum is the tabula rasa upon which to draw
sensible intervals.

When Harry Partch proclaimed 43-notes to his 2/1 it was largely to
acknowledge the inability of humans to grasp the infinite.  Partch used
numerous interval outside of the 43-note gamut in his scores.

Perhaps microtonal composers are like children in exploring the sonic
terain.  Just as a mother warns a child against turning the corner during
play time, lovingly providing safety limits, we composers have superegos
limiting our explorations into the expanse.  This appears unnecessary,
except in a personal pedagogical sense.

Now is the time for all microtonalists to learn the "essential"
relationships of a variety of pitch combinations for the betterment of
musical vocabulary, and gradually improving musical communication.

This is not meant to be a chastisement to a composer plumbing the depths
of a particular tuning.  However it is a line in the sand that ghettoizing
notes is no longer necessary, or desireable.
