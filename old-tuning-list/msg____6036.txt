A demisemitone is the difference between an augmented unison and
a minor second.  An augmented unison is the approximation of a
chromatic semitone, and a minor second of a diatonic semitone, in
a syntonic meantone.  This is the only definition of these
intervals I know, and it only applies to syntonic meantones. Hence
the same is true of demisemitones.  24tet is a special case,
because a subset of it is a syntonic meantone temperament.

The interval 7/4 is called a subminor seventh.  If you define that
as a minor seventh flattened by a demisemitone, you have a
definition of an interval.  In syntonic meantones, 7/4 is an
augmented sixth, so the two definitions agree.

I have adopted the / and \ symbols to notate boosts of this kind
of demisemitone.  There is technically a lesser demisemitone
being the difference between a greater demisemitone and an
augmented unison.

In JI, there are 2 minor sevenths -- 16/9 and 9/5 -- so there
are two greater demisemitones defined the 7-limit way.  One is
(4 -2 0 0)H - (-2 0 0 1)H = (6 -2 0 -1)H and the other is
(0 2 -1 0)H - (-2 0 0 1)H = (2 2 -1 -1)H.  The former is a
septimal comma, and has priority over the \ symbol.  / and \ can
be used generally to denote small deviations from the 5 prime
limit when meantone (eg staff) notation is used for JI.  Does
whoever originally suggested them object to this?

To unite two threads, if you define the sruti scale:

       r q r q r q r q r q r q r r q r q r q r q r
      S   r   R   g G   M   m   P   d   D   n N   S'

in a manner consistent with 22 octave reduced fifths, a septimal
comma is well approximated by q, so these small srutis are
demisemitones and, for example, the first sruti is r\.
