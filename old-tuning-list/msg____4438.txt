''I believe the use of "just" is reference to honest as being explicit to

treatise on music _A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke_
(1597), the first of its kind.''

''Just'' could not have been defined by anyone in the sixteenth century
with reference to an overtone series, as that concept had yet to be
developed. One of the now obsolete meanings for ''Just'' is ''exact'', and
it used in this sense to distinguish Just intervals from tempered, which
were used as approximations.

I find it not very useful to define Just with any appeal to nature, as
real, existing nature is frustratingly free of exact overtone series as
anyone who has ever tuned a stretched string or a metal bar or played a
brass instrument (I'm a trombonist by training) has experienced. It is
safer to define Just intonation in terms of whole number ratios, and then
to distinguish between varieties of JI on the basis of the genus (a la
Euler) or limit (a la Partch). So Pythagorean tuning is a type of (3^n) or
three limit JI; much tonal music can be performed in (3^n,5^n) or five
limit JI; the Partchian Diamond is a species of (3^4,5^2,7^2,11^2) or
eleven limit JI etc. 

The Morley text (1596) - excellent for rhythmic modes and diminution but
decidedly deficient for intonation - is the first of what kind? An earlier
(if inferior) treastise was published in English in 1584, and Morley's debt
to previous non-English publications is everywhere in evidence (e.g. the
monumental _Dodecachordon_ of Glareanus (1547) and Trigini's _Compendium_
of 1588 - from which Morley plagiarized his examples of cadential
treatment).
