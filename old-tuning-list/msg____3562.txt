Subject: Survey Refinement and Plea

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Thanks to you who have responded my admittedly not-terribly-scientific, but
hopefully interesting, survey.  I need to mention two things about the survey
though:

   First of all, I suspect that there will be a tendency of musicians on the
list to respond more vigorously than theoreticians, because several people have
called the musicality of list into question.  So let me say that there's nothing
wrong at all with being a theoretician.  Theoreticians formulate new basic ideas
for performers and composers to make musical sense of.  That's important and
valuable, so let me encourage theoreticians and musicians alike to respond
equally vigorously.  

   Second, I think I really must amend the first question by putting some
stipulations on the response "musician".  In particular, please don't respond
with "musician" unless your involvement in music includes some form of
performance, composition, or improvisation.  

   By no means am I suggesting that appreciation, analysis, or literary writing
and publishing about music, are not valuable to musicianship.  They certainly
are, but I just want to narrow down a bit the field of that particular response.


   If you have already responded and wish to change your answer to that
question, then please be sure to tell me that point out that it's a change.  I'm
only keeping raw numbers, so I need to be able to distinguish a change of vote
from a new, additional vote.  

   Thanks y'all!
