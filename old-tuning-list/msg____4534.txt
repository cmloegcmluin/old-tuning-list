Subject: Hans Fredrik Berg

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Saturday AM, I did a WEB search with AltaVista on Kathleen
Schlesinger and a few other well-known names in xenharmonics.
Only three sites were found for KS, one of which is quite 
intriguing,  http://www.alphaomega.se/svenska/lyran.html.
This page (in Swedish, Paul Rapoport helped me read it.) is 
devoted to the Norwegian-born composer Hans Fredrik Berg. 
Berg composes music in Schlesinger's harmoniai, apparently for 
an orchestra consisting mostly of home-built lyres of various 
types. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an email or
postal address for more information on him or his music, much of
which has been created in collaboration with Karin Mo"ller.
 
Berg appears to be somewhat of a mystic and is associated with 
the  Anthroposophy movement of Rudolf Steiner, best known in the
States, at least, for their private Waldorf Schools. If anyone knows 
anything further about Berg and his music, please post it to the 
Tuning List. 

While Schlesinger's harmoniai may not really have much to do with 
ancient Greek music, they are fascinating in their own right.
The diatonic forms are essentially Utonality (subharmonic) heptads
through prime number 13 (including 9), though the hypo modes tend
to substitute 15 for 14 (7). The harmoniai are distinguished 
primarily by the choice of tonic and are modes of each other.
