Actually, Martin Vogel has devoted considerable energy to this very task. 
Harold and Jose, I should mention him as a reference to you. See "On the 
Relations of Tone," which I discussed a bit in a previous tuning digest. 
Just as 5-limit systems are simpler to conceptualize and notate in some 
tunings (such as 19) than others (such as 34), so 7-limit systems may take 
on very different forms depending on the tuning used (22, 27, 31). This is 
something outside of Vogel's scope, and something that I have some ideas 
about, and Harold may as well. See my post about commas, for instance.
