This is nonsense. The gentleman to whom I was addressing the remark to
which you take exception, has adopted an insolent tone from start to
finish, in which tone I have never replied to him (until now), even
under the most direct provocation, for he does seem to know enough to
contribute something. It is no insult to anyone to say a particular
system is of little value to music. If this tuning list is nothing more
than a mutual admiration society for various kinds of musico-academic
hangers-on, designed to rope in the unwary to the idle joys of any one
of a number of very dubious tuning systems, it is a fraud, and the
progress to which you refer, nothing more than an aimless, desultory
meandering.

I thank you for your kind remarks concerning my posts. I hope that I
have provided people with a few new ideas of interest. My other
responsibilities will soon greatly curtail my posts, I fear, so these
few individuals who find themselves mortally offended by every other
thing I say, will soon be left to nurse their 20-tone equal babies in
peace.
