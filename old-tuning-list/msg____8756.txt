Patrick Ozzard-Low sends his greetings to
the Tuning Forum!  He's now finishing up the
San Diego leg of the USA part of his travelling
fellowship to study microtonal instruments.

He gave a seminar yesterday at UCSD, which was
attended by many of the eminent microtonalists
in the area, as well as the UCSD students.

There was great information and terrific photos of
the wonderful instruments Patrick's seen on his trip,
some of them built by Tuning Forum subscribers.

He's off to Rio de Janiero tomorrow.

His book "21st Century Orchestral Instruments"
can be downloaded from:
