Congratulations to Manuel Op de Coul on
a magnificent achievement.  His latest
upgrade of the tuning program SCALA
more than fulfills the promise of the
earlier versions of the program.
As some of you may know, SCALA is
a program which allows users to
design, alter, combine, stretch,
and transmute tunings in a variety
of ways.  SCALA includes a vast
cornucopia of scale generation 
methods: cyclic, equal-tempered
(octave and non-octave), polynomial,
Wilson CPS permutation, Pythagorean,
and many others.
However, SCALA is not merely a tuning
program.  It includes an entire programming
language which allows you to write command
scripts which execute automatically and
write huge numbers to disk.  So it's not
really accurate to call SCALA a "program"--
it's an entire tuning programming language.
Nothing like SCALA has ever existed before.
Prior attempts, like the excellent JiCalc,
forced users to enter each scale-step one
at a time, and shackled users with severe
constraints: only 60 scale-steps could
be entered, all steps had to be specified
as just ratios (a very bizarre requirement
if your scale in a non-just non-equal-tempered
tuning!), and so on.
However, Manuel Op de Coul's SCALA overcomes
all these limitations.
I must admit that previous versions of SCALA did
not work with any of my MIDI cards.  Perhaps it
was my setup, or perhaps my cards, or perhaps
it was the older versions of the program--but I
had never succeeded in transmitting a tuning
to any of my synthesizers.
However, the latest version of SCALA transmits
tunings to my synthesizers quickly and easily.
The program works with perfect transparency:
you simply follow Manuel's command script,
the synth is retuned...it's that simple.  SCALA
is even *easier* to use than the Mac application
JiCalc. (Alas, those of you who own Macintoshes
now know why Apple Computer will go bankrupt.
None of the useful programs on the old 680X0
Macintoshes run on the garbage Power Macs.
If you want to run JiCalc, here's a piece of 
advice: buy an old Mac Plus cheap at a swap
meet and use it run JiCalc.  Otherwise, you're
out of luck.)
SCALA is a remarkable accomplishment. It
is one of the most important developments in
the post-1983 modern era of retunable MIDI
synthesizers.
Congratulations on a job well done, Manuel.
