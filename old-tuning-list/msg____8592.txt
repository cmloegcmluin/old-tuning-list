Subject: Tuning-List CD

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

Today I received my copies of Neil Haverstick's tuning-list compilation
CD.  As with John Starrett, Neil has been very excited about it, and I'll
definitely chime in on that excitement too.  I think it turned out quite
nicely indeed!  If there are any disappointments to voice, they're very
minor ones at worst.

   I'll see about coming up with a review of it later (actually, I'll
encourage somebody who didn't contribute to review it first).  But here are
the strongest impressions the CD leaves me with:
1.  After all the theorizing we do on this list, it sure is great to hear
    some actual music coming from us!
2.  This CD presents a very wide variety of styles, from pop, to
    middle-eastern, to Renaissancey, to spacey, to abstract.
3.  It also has a wide variety of tunings, 19TET being the most
    common, but various forms of Just Intonation being a close
    second.
4.  It also has a wide gamut of ... how do I phrase this? ...
    flagrancy of microtonality.  Some used microtonality to provide
    a distinctive coloring, and others used it to produce a completely
    alien musical experience.  I suspect that Stephen James Taylor's
    contribution is the most flagrantly microtonal (as my boss would
    say, "yeeehah!"), but a couple others were very close behind
    him.

   In addition to once again thanking Neil for his efforts in putting this
together, I'd also like to thank and congratulate the contributors:
Stephen James Taylor, Warren Burt, John Starrett, Bill Sethares, Neil
Haverstick, John Loffink, Richard Sanford, Denny Genovese, Ernie Crews,
Bill Alves, Carter Scholz, and ... (hmmm, is it proper to congratulate
yourself?).

   And I'd also like to thank the list-masters at Mills College for putting
us all together!

   So, I'll go ahead and break the ice:  $10 a copy, including postage.
I'm at 13036 Staton Drive; Austin, TX 78727-4513; USA.  Please send only US
funds, no credit cards, and all that rot.
