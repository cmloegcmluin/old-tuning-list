Subject: Brain Activity

From: <Nangaku@aol.com>

I also have another question not directly related to tuning - does anyone know
of research that's been done measuring the effects of music on brain activity?
If anyone has any knowledge, I can be emailed directly at Nangaku@aol.com. Any
info would be greatly appreciated.
