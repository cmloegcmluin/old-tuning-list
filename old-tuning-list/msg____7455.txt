Subject: tangential question -- lutherie

From: Steven  Rezsutek <steven.rezsutek@hq.nasa.gov>

This isn't exactly tuning related, but...

I've kind of hit my skill limits in instrument making for now, (not to
mention the time involved, which might be better spent finishing the
studio and kitchen :-) so I'm looking into having one built.  It's
still tenative, but the deal would be that I'd supply a fingerboard in
my tuning of choice (22 tet) and it would be attached to the
instrument by the maker, and given a full setup.

Are any of the luthiers on the list aware of a source for stainless
steel fretwire? (yes, I know what a PITA stainless is to work with :)
The folks at LMI didn't know of any, and I couldn't come up with much
on the web.

Also, any thoughts on fret profile in general?  Is it better to have a
sharp tangent or as much contact area as possible between the string
and fret.

I did find some triangular bar stock, which might fit in a fingerboard
cut with a tiny dovetail bit.  It's pretty much the same idea as
Emmett Chapman's (patented?) FretRods, which I might also be able to
emulate with a spherical bit on the router and round stock.  Since
he'll be building the instrument, maybe he won't yell at me. :-)


Thanks,

Steve
