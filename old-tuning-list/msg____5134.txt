Subject: Hearing at high frequencies

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

When I was in high school I hooked a variable frequency oscillator up to a
loudspeaker. I had no problem hearing sound up to around 24 KHz. I remember
a fellow student whose hearing cut out above around 15 KHz. I distinctly
remember playing a sound at about 18KHz, loud enough to be uncomfortable for
me, and this other student did notice the sound at all. Another fellow student
could hear sounds up around 22 KHz no problem. 

I shudder to think what many intevening years of rock music have done for me.

Jim
