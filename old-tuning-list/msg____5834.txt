Subject: Re: Carlsberg Beer

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

According to Craig Adcock, in _James Turrell: The Art of Light and Space_,
an experiment carried out by Kristian Holt-Hansen in 1968 involving ''Taste
and Pitch'' tested how the tastes of Carlsberg Lager and Carlsberg Elephant
beer were affect by sound: at 650 Hz. for the Elephant and 10-15 Hz. for
the Lager, the beer tasted distinctly better. I believe that L. Wechsler
gives a different version of the results in his monograph on Robert Irwin. I have no idea if or how the taste of Carlsberg Beer has changed over theyears (and personally, I stick to stouts and Roggenbiers), but I anxiously
await verification or revision of the results present above. A serious task
for tuning scholars, at last!
