Unfortunately, as Harry Partch pointed out at least 25 years ago,
Indian music has been drifting closer and closer to 12-eq ever
since the British took over, and as far as I know it's still drifting
(someone correct me if I'm wrong).

In fact, one of the things that provided me with an impetus for
developing my JustMusic microtonal notation was the rapid
pace at which music from other cultures was being forced
into the 12-eq mold.  With the proliferation of pianos, guitars,
and other western-European instruments all over the world,
it's been difficult for musicians in cultures which use
non-12-eq tunings to maintain the traditional intonation of
their music.  Hopefully, the widespread availability of
re-tuning on synthesizers and computers can correct
some of this before it's lost forever.
