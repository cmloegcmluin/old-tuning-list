Subject: Definition of consistency

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

It appears that Paul R. hasn't caught on to the consistency thread, although 
he certainly understands the concept. Since even the Great McLaren's 
interest was piqued by one of my posts on consistency, maybe it's worth 
reviewing. Unfortunately, all of my e-mail from that far back is lost, so 
instead I'll review Manuel's post in Tuning Digest 776:

Here's a definition of consistency: Given an odd number n, an octave-based 
equal temperament is consistent within the n-limit if, for any odd numbers 
a, b, and c such that 0<a<b<c<=n, the number of steps that best approximates 
a:b plus the number of steps that best approximates b:c is equal to the 
number of steps that best approximates a:c.

No equal temperament can be adequately notated using the symbols of just 
intonation (Pythagorean scale plus syntonic commas) if it is not consistent 
within the 5-limit. Paul Rapoport disagrees. I guess we'll just have to 
agree to disagree.

I found 111-tet by looking at consist_limits.txt.
