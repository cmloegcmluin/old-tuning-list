Subject: Tuning Formula

From: "Darren Burgess" <dburgess@acceleration.net>

I am in the process of tuning some steel bars.  Does anybody know the
formula used to calculate the length of a bar when given the frequency and
length of another bar and target frequency of the bar to be tuned?  The
formula assumes that the bars are cut from the same consistent material.

Thank you,
