I don't have any deep or rigorous explanation for it, but whenever one
finds a ET number with high consistency for its size (like 12) its
multiples tend to drop off rapidly in consistency level.

Here's how Fred's suggested numbers look:

(limit) 3   5   7   9
---------------------
 768|   .   .   .
 864|   .   .
1024| 312   .   .
1152|   4   3   2   .
1280|   2   .

(1152 looks the best of those, although 1024 is a power of 2 and has
great 3/2s--level 312 is a bit of overkill, though. 8-)> )

Of the multiple-of-12 numbers in my first list, their prime
factorizations are:

612 = 17 * 3^2 * 2^2
624 = 13 * 3   * 2^4
684 = 19 * 3^2 * 2^2

Compare these to the numbers in Fred's list:

 768 = 3   * 2^8
 864 = 3^3 * 2^5
1024 =       2^10
1152 = 3^2 * 2^7
1280 = 5   * 2^8

1200, BTW, is 5^2 * 3 * 2^4.

I don't have time just at the moment (maybe this weekend) to do a more
thorough search, but others are welcome to look through my consist.txt
table and suggest better compromises.
