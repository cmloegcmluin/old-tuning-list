Subject: Re: Mozart Tuning

From: monz@juno.com

Back in Philadelphia I had a copy of an
article that appeared in some music theory
journal; it was specifically about Mozart's
intonation.

Apparently he used (or thought) in a 17-tone
scale, the regular diatonic notes, and two
separate notes for each sharp and flat --
probably meantone.

I have no way to cite the source now, but
perhaps some others out there know of it.
It was probably the Musical Quarterly or the
Journal of Music Theory.
