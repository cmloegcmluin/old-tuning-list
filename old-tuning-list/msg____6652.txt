   It sounds like you're confusing different melodies with tuning subtlties.

   Suppose you were to listen to me on my soprano saxophone right after
I've warmed up and started playing some piece I'm working on.  Then suppose
you were to hear me play that same piece after an hour and a half when my
lips have the saxophonist's equivalent of a charliehorse.

   Assuming that I execute that melody note-for-note correctly both times,
the chances are that you'll notice two things:
1.  It's the same melody.
2.  It sure as heck was better in tune the first time!

   Certainly you'll identify it as the same melody both times, but equally
certainly you'll identify it as sounding different.

   Are those 10-20-cent differences musically significant?  Well, they are
very clearly audible, so it's pretty hard to deny that have at least the
potential to be musically significant.
