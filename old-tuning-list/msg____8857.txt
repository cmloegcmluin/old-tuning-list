One of the most important things to consider, if you are trying to
achieve consonance on the carillon, is that bells have completely
inharmonic partials. If constructing an optimal tuning for the bells, I
would need to know the frequencies of the partial tones of the bells. JI
maximizes consonance only for instruments with harmonic partials, such
as human voices, bowed strings, brass, and reed instruments, and
periodic synthesized tones (and even then there are some chords where JI
is not necessarily best).
