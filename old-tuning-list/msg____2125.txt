Subject: Updated scale archive

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

The scale archive with the collections of John Chalmers and myself
has been updated and contains now over 1250 scales.
The scales.doc file contains the complete listing. It's found here:

http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/scales.doc (readme file, ASCII)
http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/scales.zip (ZIP file, binary)

Use the "-a" option while unzipping. The size of the ZIP file is about
284 Kb. FTP is possible also from ftp.cs.ruu.nl.
The file format of the scales is that of my tuning program Scala,
which I hope will be available soon. The files are text files so also
usable without it.
