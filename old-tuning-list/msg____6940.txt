Subject: Re: AWE 64G and other gear.

From: "Fred Kohler" <Fred_Kohler@bc.sympatico.ca>

Graham Breed said in Digest 1290,
"It is possible to set up Sound Fonts with specific tunings for
the 64G.  I know how to do this, I just have to get round to
writing a program to automate the process."

Since my Tropez plus apparently packed it up (possibly a motherboard
problem)  I currently can't detwelvulate.  I replaced it with an AWE 64 gold
as an interim solution until I could afford a reliable external sound
module.   I would be VERY interested to do such a program or at least to
help out.  I have a Delphi compiler for Win 95 and Windows 3.1. Could you
please send me info by private email as to how it's done?   I would also be
interested in your program to retune by pitch bends if you'd be willing to
share it until the other program is up and running.

He also said,
"I've also got a Wave Blaster daughterboard, living in a different
PC.  I have seen mention of this having tuning capabilities.  Is
this right?"

That's entirely correct.  Just use the Emu Proteus family setting on any
software that you're using; the Sysex format is the same.

For those that are interested other gear that I use:
Ztar Mini ZX MIDI controller (currently developing a Patch editor for this)
Roland PC-200 keyboard MIDI controller
World Music Menu retuning software
Scala (the latest version)
PowerTracks Pro (excellent reasonably priced sequencer)
