I'd like to deal with two points arising from this exchange: in this 
message the application of the term "wolf", and then, when I have time 
to write another message, the issue of wandering tonics in JI.

The term "wolf" has long been applied to diminished sixths which 
appear on a 12-note-per-octave keyboard as fifths. The usage goes back 
at least as far as Schlick's *Spiegel* (1511): if the keyboard was tuned  
from Eb to G# (irrespective of whether the tuning chosen was 
Pythagorean, meantone or Schlick's own irregular temperament), then the 
interval G# to Eb, when the G# was unhappily pressed into service as an 
Ab, would constitute the wolf "fifth"; it was up to the keyboard player 
to avoid a sustained wolf by means of decoration, permitting tritones 
that singers would avoid, or ad hoc ficta adjustments. The number of 
notes per octave is not the cause of the problem, which will always 
reappear in any tuning or temperament that is not closed (closed being 
12TET or the various 18th-century irregular well-tempered systems: to 
"well-temper" was simply to remove the wolf). In much music c.1500 the 
wolf, even on a 12-note keyboard didn't necessarily constitute a great 
problem, at least for the clavichord: if the piece to be played included 
a G#, all was well; if it included an Ab, then the G#s could all be 
retuned within a minute or two by conscientious players. The need for 
both G# and Ab did not arise so often as to defeat the measures I have 
mentioned above (the same problems and solutions were present for C# 
versus Db etc.).

Now here is the point: a JI keyboard, such as Zarlino envisaged, would 
also contain a wolf: i.e. a diminished sixth which the unwary player 
might call upon to serve as a perfect fifth. But in addition to this, it 
would contain a 40/27 -- a perfect fifth less a syntonic comma. Without 
dividing the lower rank of keys -- i.e. our white keys today -- this 
would appear between D and A if the Ptolemy sequence was chosen as the 
basis of the tuning (as Zarlino wished). Leaving aside the question of 
whether a JI keyboard is practicable (I would certainly say it isn't, 
and that 1/4-comma meantone is the practical keyboard equivalent of 
5-limit JI), we are left with a terminology problem: we have two 
varieties of interval which are not what they seem from the layout of 
the keyboard, namely the 40/27 and the diminished sixth (192/125).

Do we really want to use the same term "wolf" for these two very 
different intervals? The 40/27 is a syntonic comma flat of a 3/2 perfect 
fifth, while a 5-limit diminished sixth is 41 cents _sharp_ of a 3/2. To 
complicate matters further, the established usage of wolf for a 
diminished sixth in any open tuning/temperament allows it to be applied 
legitimately to a range of intervals: e.g. the 3-limit diminished sixth 
is 262144/177147, a Pythagorean comma _flat_ of a 3/2. So even leaving 
aside meantone and its relatives, and various open irregular 
temperaments used in the 16th and 17th centuries, we have a 5-limit wolf 
41 cents sharp of 3/2 and a 3-limit wolf 21.5 cents flat of 3/2.

Dressing up a 40/27 in wolves' clothing, however many recent precedents 
can be adduced, therefore seems a recipe for irretrievable theoretical 
confusion.
