Subject: NTR:  Viruses Via E-mail

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

Forgive me for the Non-Tuning-Related ("NTR") message here, but I
thought it worth setting the record straight about one detail.

   A while back somebody on the list intercepted a hoax message about a new
E-mail-conducted virus.  At least two of us responded saying that it was
nothing to worry about, since a computer can't contract a virus (or do
anything AT ALL for that matter) without actually running the program that
embodies the virus, and merely reading an E-mail message can't possibly
result in your computer executing the E-mail as a program.

   Well, that assumes that you don't have your E-mail program set to
blindly execute every attachment it receives WITH that E-mail.  I had never
even heard of any E-mail programs that offer such a ludicrously dangerous
option, but apparently at least one does.  Definitely turn that option off
if your program has it.

   But as long as you don't blindly run attached files, your computer
definitely can't get a virus from merely reading E-mail.
