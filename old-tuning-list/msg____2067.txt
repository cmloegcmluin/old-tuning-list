Frankly, I don't know what I was refering to.  I thought I had remembered
reading a reference to flat fifths somewhere; one hour of going through my
notes yielded nothing, however.  My apologies to yourself, Mr. Reinhard
and members of this List for this flub.

Sorry, my original quote should have read: "What Marpurg probably meant
to say was that if all the major thirds where to be made [equally as] wide, a
major third, wide by a syntonic comma, was not possible."  Marpurg,
however, was still wrong.  The passage in question here is, admittedly,
sloppy work on the part of Marpurg.  As anyone familiar with his work in
temperament knows, this is not characteristic of Marpurg's work, where he
is one of the most precise writers in 18th-century Germany.

I have spent many years reading the primary sources.  In writing my
dissertation, I've read all of Marpurg, all of Kirnberger and everyone else
that dealt with tuning and temperament in Germany.  Undoubtedly, I've
missed some sources.  But not a lot, I trust.  Unlike today, when scientific
writing tends to adhere to the "stylus dragneticus," 18th-century German
scientific writing was very personal (there are exceptions) and one quickly
becomes almost "personally" familiar with the writer.  One knows how they
thought and gets a strong feeling as to what they would react like given a
certain set of circumstances.  Spending so much time with them, I almost
feel as if I knew these men, who died over 200 years ago.  If I make a
conjecture, it is based on this intimacy and a body of evidence.  It is not
incorrect jurisprudence to extrapolate postulates based on a given body of
evidence and knowledge of the subject's past behavior.

Yes.  One bumbling error does not the whole of Marpurg make.

Although I admire Ms. Steblin's writings, I believe that she is wrong here.
Although Tempelhof may have begun the review in question, Kirnberger
himself (trying to pull a 'Marpurg') must have finished it.  This is evident in
the break of literary style (Tempelhof's and Kirnberger's litterary styles are
completely dissimilar) and I would be very surprised indeed that if, upon
meeting Kirnberger in the afterlife, he would tell me that Tempelhof wrote
the whole thing...    ;)

Bzzzz.  Wrong again.  The quote to which Ms.Steblin refers (contained in
the infamous 23er Abschnitt of Marpurg's _Versuch_ ) is not about
whether Kirnberger was being faithful to Bach or not.  It was about
Kirnberger's invocation of authority over empirical evidence.  Read the
section yourself, then we can talk (_Versuch_ [1776], pp.182-219).

>: Marpurg then
>: appealed to Bach's sons to substantiate him in his claim, but this ruse

Marpurg actually *quoted* C.P.E. Bach (_Versuch ueber die wahre
Kunst_) and *only* C.P.E. Bach.  No letters were exchanged, as she
implies...

Wow.  Ms. Steblin streches quite a bit in drawing this conclusion.
(Her translation isn't very good either.)
My feeling is that the passage in question refers to Marpurg's _Versuch_ on
the whole (remember that the second half of the _Versuch_  (90-some
pages) has nothing to do with temperament but is a giant polemic on
Kirnbergers harmonic theories as opposed to Rameau's (which Marpurg
really didn't fully understand himself).
