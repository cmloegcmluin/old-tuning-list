Subject: Out in the Microfest town of El Paso

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Yes, Dr. Mommy's Microball had many good qualities...meeting a bunch of
micro compadres was a hoot...Erv Wilson is someone rather special, I
think...genius fits, but is not enough...there's something extra about
his ability to see the world in a deeper way than most folks...there was
great music played, interesting conversations happening, and very good
press coverage, in the papers, radioplay, and a TV slot on Sunday. But,
I must say, that perhaps the neatest thing for me was that kids of
differnt ages were on hand, playing the instruments, and hearing sounds
which could affect their musicality for the rest of their lives. If we
micropioneers want to truly change things, we must educate others in a
real natural way, and kids is the best place to start. My 10 year old
cousin was playing Xmas carols on Erv's 22 tone tubalong, and no one
seemed to thionk it was WEIRD...very cool.
We need more of these festivals to happen, on a regular basis, we need
books written about tunings in a down to earth language, and we need to
demystify this whole field if we want it to spread...McLaren's post
about the economics of 12eq was great, and underscores an important
point: money, not art, is often a motivating factor in this world, so we
need to find a way to make beautiful art a part of mainstream
culture...only a lot of great compositions, and the skills to get them
to folks everywhere, will break the stranglehold of the dreaded 12 tone
temperament...Hstick
