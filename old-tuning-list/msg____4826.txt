Subject: TUNING IN errors

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Errors in Scott Wilkinson: "Tuning In".

page 17:
"The nearest whole number ratio for this interval (12th root of 2) is
89/84."
"The nearest whole number ratio (for 1 cent) is 1731/1730."

Nearest whole number ratios to irrational numbers do not exist.
And 1732/1731 is closer to 1 cent.

page 20:
"Great Diesis"

The name Great Diesis for the interval 125:128 can be confusing
since there is a major diesis of 648/625 that is larger. It is
generally called "minor diesis" or only "diesis". 

page 40, 120:
"Art Schnitger"

Arp Schnitger

page 43:
"Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer and philosopher of the 18th 
century."

He was just as much a physicist and mathematian but not really a 
philosopher. He lived from 14 April 1629 to 8 July 1695, so that's in
the 17th century. 

page 65:
Four values in the Pythagorean scale are wrong.

page 67:
"... the primary fifths C-G-D-A-E are tuned flat by one quarter of the 
Pythagorean comma."

This must be syntonic comma. The values in the scale are calculated with 
the Pythagorean comma and then still four values wrong.

page 68:
The Werckmeister scale has five incorrect values.
The Vallotti scale has six incorrect values.

page 69:
"Raising the F# by 1/6 comma (3.91 cents) ..."

That's 3.58 comma. Six false notes here too.

page 74:
17th Century here too.

page 112:
"Denielou"

Danie'lou

page 113:
"Xenharmonicon ..."

Xenharmonikon. The editor is John Chalmers again now.

page 115:
The address of Grey Matter Response is out of date.
