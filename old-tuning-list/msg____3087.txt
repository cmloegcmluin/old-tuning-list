Subject: Tuning Preferences

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I have slightly edited Brian's message this AM in the direction of 
civility as I think it has enough interesting points to be worth posting,
even if it is "old business." The JI versus ET or nj-net debate is 
unlikely to be resolved, especially since Roberts and Mathews found that 
there are two types of listeners, those that prefer JI and those that 
prefer the richness of intervals tuned sharp or flat in triads. Frankly, 
given the over-learning of 12-tet that musically trained subjects will 
have been subjected to and the self-selection that musically naive 
persons 
will have undergone for the lack of musical discrimination abilities, I 
tend to be skeptical of many preference studies. My advice is for 
composers 
and performers to use the tuning they find best for their musical 
purposes. 
I suspect that their audiences will usually agree.

   Traditional and Non-Traditional Chords", Journal of the Acoustical
   Society of America vol. 75, 1984, pp. 952-959.
