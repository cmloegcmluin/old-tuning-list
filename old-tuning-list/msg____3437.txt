Subject: last comment on Partch

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...Reinhard's comment on Partch's morbidity hit a big
chord with me...now, I have not talked to Johnny to see what he meant,
exactly, so this is only my take on the subject...actually, there is
a FEELING in Partch's music that is extremely repellent to me, and
this has been so since the first time I ever heard him, LONG before I
knew anything about microtonality or his 43/oct tuning. And, this is
VERY subjective...I just don't like listening to his stuff because of
the "vibe" inherent in his music...it has nothing to do with understand-
ing his system, or getting used to it, or anything like that...the music
does not appeal to me, genius or no. And, if it doesn't appeal to myself,
who can listen to stuff that drives most folks out of the room, I can
imagine the effect his music would have on most people. Again, so there
is no misunderstanding, this has nothing to do with Partch's genius,
or his contributions to the evolvement of music theory...I didn't like
Stevie Ray Vaughn much, either, and I pissed a few folks off on that
count, as well....Hstick
