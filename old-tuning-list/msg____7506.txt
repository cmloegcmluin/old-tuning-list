Subject: Mac computers and tuning/tempering

From: rumsong@cadvision.com (Gordon Rumson)

Greetings,

I have an older Mac 660AV using only Quicktime 2.5.  Is there a program for
making the Mac play a variety of tunings and temperaments?

Any help, including reference to archives or FAQs, greatly appreciated.
Many thanks in advance.

All best wishes,

Gordon Rumson
