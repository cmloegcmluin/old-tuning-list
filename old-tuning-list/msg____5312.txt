Subject: Ya gotta have halls

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

''Little'' Bridges Hall of Music at Pomona College (Claremont, CA) is an
extraordinary place for hearing both chamber and large ensemble musics and
quite beautiful to look at as well. There is not much of a backstage, but
that could be solved in a number of ways; too, the organ console could be
better placed.

However, in general, I find that a 500-600 seat hall is a curious beast. A
recital hall for chamber music is probably optimal at 150-250 seats. An
professional orchestral hall will probably demand - for economic reasons -
a capacity of well over 600. If the target is to play classical repertoire,
then I would look seriously at those halls in Salzburg, Vienna, Prague
where the repertoire was premiered (how about ''historical performance
practice'' for concert hall architecture?*). If the needs are very diverse
it might be worthwhile looking at the mistakes (and some successes) made by
IRCAM in attempting to design a flexible space. If recording is very
important I would look at the Sendesaal of Hessischer Rundfunk in
Frankfurt, which seats around 600, sounds great, but feels like a cross
between an airplane hanger and a basketball court.

In any case, sound isolation is extremely important, the climate control
must have the ability to be shut down immediately and noiselessly
(Heinz-Klaus Metzger has quipped that Webern was the last composer to
compose before the advent of air conditioned concert halls), the chairs
should be comfortable, and glass walls never work in concert halls. And by
all means, if there is to be an organ, put it in an appropriate tuning,
with split keys if needed.

* One historical practice germane to the tuning list that might be worth
reviving is the use of resonant cavities in the walls or under the stage
floor to amplify particular frequencies. _The New Grove_ article on
acoustics describes some of these. With automated controls it should be
possible to modify the dimensions of such cavities to optimize the hall for
individual concerts or even pieces.
