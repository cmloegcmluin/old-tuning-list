>(which I clearly hear). However, since you're using a "prime," not "odd"

>only true that odd limit 3 is more consonant that odd limit 7. Odd limit 9 is
>naturally slightly more dissonant that odd limit 7, though this ordering may

>tune" may have much more to do with familiar scalar intervals than familiar
>harmonic intervals, and some pure 7s hidden in inner voices will sound just
>fine to even the most culturally conditioned of listeners.
