I think what Paul Hahn means is that the greater surface 
area allows the vibrations of the air to be transferred 
into the body of the instrument more easily. I would add
that it it also allows the reverse, so the greater the 
vibrating surface area, the louder the instrument is and 
the more sensitive to external sounds it is, so we hear
tubular bells resonate to coughs because of their surface 
area coming and going, but we don't hear lone strings 
(without a soundbox) resonate because of their surface
area coming and going. 

Of course there are other factors too. A painting
has a lot of surface area but is not either
very stiff or very tense (as a drum head would be) 
and absorbs the air vibrations, changing them 
into heat via internal friction in the canvas.


Since writing the above, I've read further in the thread.

I will add that a sound box (like the body of a violin)
is designed not to have particular resonances, or at 
least to have its resonances spread out into wide bands. 
That's why you don't hear the violin body responding to 
and sustaining particular notes when you sing while 
muting the strings. 

The strings are designed to have strong resonance 
peaks which is why certain notes are sustained when 
you sing while the strings left free to vibrate. 

A sound box is also designed to be in good contact 
with the vibrating element (violin string) so that 
vibration can be conducted from the element to the 
sound box and then to the air for us to hear. 

Now, I know of no way to allow sound conduction in 
one direction and not the other. Sound must conduct 
mechanically from the sound box to the string just 
as easily as from the string to the sound box. Also 
sound must conduct as easily from the air into the 
sound box as it does from the sound box into the air. 

The sound box and string together then make a single 
vibrating system, which is in good contact with the 
air. It has the dual advantages of musically usable 
high-peak resonances (the centers of these resonances 
are even adjustable by stopping the string to 
different lengths!) and good body-to-air contact 
provided by the large surface area of the sound box. 

Since sound is conducted equally well in both directions 
between string and body, and equally well in both 
directions between air and body, it makes sense to me 
that when you sing, the air vibrations are picked up 
only slightly by the string's small contact with the 
air and more greatly by the body which then conducts 
the vibration to the strings, but that the strings, 
though having poor direct contact with the air, will 
determine which notes the system as a whole resonates 
best to. 

Going back to the hanging chimes, each tubular bell
is a single system which has both large surface
area and definitive peak resonances (unlike a violin body).

Now, what do we tune these to? :)
