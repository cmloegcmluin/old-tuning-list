Subject: The Gelfond-Schneider Theorem and
 non-just non-equal-tempered scales
---
It occurs to me that n-j n-e-t scales undoubtedly
seem more mysterious than either just or equal
tempered tunings because the mathematical
basis of n-j n-e-t scales is not as obvious.
This post attempts to clarify that mathematical
basis.
First, a word about traditional tunings:
If we describe the scale steps of any given
tuning as a number between 0 and 1, the
mathematical basis of just tunings is simple
and straightforward:  k[n] = A/B  where both
A and B are integers.  The only ambiguity here
is the question of whether or not A and B are
"small."  This is clearly a matter of personal
taste.  John Chalmers and Your Humble E-Mail
Correspondent consider many of Erv Wilson's
CPS  tuning to be examples of just intonation, and
thus made up of the ratio of "small" integers:
however, many of those integers are not small
in the usual sense defined by Partch, Doty,
Johnston, et al.  For example, the [1,7, 19, 37]
hexany consists of ratios of numbers to the
generator 7*19*37 = 4921.  This number is
"small" compared to a googol, or to the 
number of atoms in the Local Cluster of
galaxies: but it is large compared to, say,
31 or 43.  Thus, some tuning theorists 
would consider this Wilson CPS tuning *not*
to be a just tuning, while others *would.*
It is a matter of taste.
For equal-tempered tunings, the scale-
step is described with equal simplicity:
k[n] = 2^[n/M]
In this case every scale-step of every
equal-tempered tuning is described by
an irrational number.
So far, so good.   Just tunings have scale
steps described by ratios of integers: 
equal-tempered tunings have scale steps
described by irrational numbers. 
An irrational number is a real solution of an
algebraic equation.  An integer is the
real solution of an ordinal arithmetic 
equation.
Thus tunings can be defined by the class
of equations to which the ratios which define
the scale-steps of the tuning form solutions.
For example: 
Algebraic equations involve a finite
number of integers raised to integer
powers:  say, X = A + By^2 + Cy^5.
Ordinal arithmetic equations involve integers:
X = A/C + D or X = A*B, etc.
(You might have noticed that my definition
of integers is circular.  This is because the
question of what an integer is happens to
be a very deep one.  It is indeed very,
*very* difficult to define an integer in
abstract terms without using an equation
which involves integers.  If memory serves,
the Bourbaki collective devoted an entire
volume to the definition of an integer.)
This gives us a handle on what is meant
by a "non-just non-equal-tempered scale."
Clearly, if the scale-steps of a just scale
are *integers* and if the scale-steps of
an equal-tempered scale are *irrationals,*
then the scale-steps of a non-just non-
equal-tempered scale must be given by
transcendental numbers.
What is a transcendental number?
How is such a number defined?
Is there a general mathematical procedure
for obtaining transcendental numbers?
This, as it happens, is also a deep question.
In fact it is often *VERY* difficult to *prove*
mathematically that a given number is
transcendental.
For instance, e^pi is known to be 
transcendental--but pi^e has never
been proven transcendental (though most
mathematicians believe it to be).
In fact the number pi itself was not
proven transcendental until 1882. 
(F. Lindemann, in the paper "Ueber die
Zahl Pi," took that honor.)
One of the perplexities which attend
transcendental numbers is the fact
that while there is a general criterion
for determining whether a number is an
integer (Does it satisfy an ordinal arithmetic
equation?) and for determining whether
a number is irrational (Does it *NOT*
satisfy an ordinary arithmetic equation and is it 
a real root ofan algebraic equation?) there 
appears to be NO general criterion for 
determining whether a number is 
transcendental.
Consequently, many different (non-obvious,
counterintuitive) equations generate
transcendental numbers.
For example, the number i^i is 
transcendental--in fact it is equal to
e^[-pi/2] = 0.2078795.   ("i" here refers 
to the square root of -1.)
This sounds absolutely insane, but it
happens to be true...and provable!
Like quantum mechanics, many of
the results of mathematics follow
the rule: "If it makes intuitive sense
to you, then you don't really understand it."
The real part of log(i) is also
transcendental: log(i) = i*pi/2.
Thus, while there's no general
formula or method for generating
transcenedental numbers, quite a
few transcendental numbers have
been discovered over the last few
milennia...mainly by chance.
Here are few:
Liouville numbers have been
proven transcendental. They were
discovered in 1851 (much later
than pi or e) and are given by the
formula: Sum from k = 1 to
infinity over a[k]*r^[-k!] where
"!" means "factorial" and a[k]
is an integer twixt 0 and r.   
There are infinitely many
Liouville numbers.  For instance,
if all a[k] = 1 and base r = 10,
we get 1/10 + 1/(10^[1*2]) +
1/(10^[1*2*3]) + ...  =
0.1100010000000000000000001000...
Depending on how the a[k] are
chosen, many different Liouville
numbers arise. One might pick the
a[k] as the fractional part of the 
decimal expansion of e, or pi, 
or of an irrational number such
as 2^[1/3], etc. 
Euler's constant gamma is transcendental.
It's given by the limit for n = - infinity
of the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...+ 
1/n - ln(n)
Gamma = 0.577215...
Catlan's constant is another lesser-known
number. It has not yet been proven 
transcendental, but mathematicians
widely believe it to be. It's given by
the formula G = sum of (-1)^k/(2k+ 1)^2
= 1 - 1/9 + 1/25 - 1/49...
Chapernowne's number is also generally
believed transcendental.  It is constructed
by concatenating the digits of the
positive integers: C = 
0.1234567891011121314151617181920...
As mentioned in my series of posts on
generating non-just non-equal-tempered
scales last year, the zeta function also yields
transcendental numbers.  However, my
post did not specify that the zeta function
must be evaluated at rational points: zeta(K)
can be either real or imaginary, since K can
be either real or imaginary.  For K not equal
to a real integer, zeta(K) is in general not
transcendental.  However this still leaves us
with zeta(2), zeta(3), zeta(5), etc., all
trascendental.
Of particular interest in the construction
of non-just non-equal-tempered scales is
the Gelfond-Schneider theorem.  According
to this theorem, any number of the form a^b is 
trascendental where a and b are algebraic (a
<> 0, a <> 1) and b is not a rational number.
This formula spews out an infinite number
of transcendental numbers, since (for example)
Hilbert's number, 2^[sqrt(2)] is clearly
transcendental, ditto 2^[sqrt(5)], 3^[fifth root of 7],
etc.
Feigenbaum numbers are also transcendental.
These numbers arise from chaos theory and
are related to properties of dynamical systems
which exhibit period-doubling and other chaotic
behaviour.  The Feigenbaum number is
4.66920160910299067185320382046620161725...
Alas, equations involving transcendental numbers
do not necessarily produce solutions which are
transcendental.  e^[i*pi] = 1, an integer, while (e^[i*pi]) + 
2*phi = sqrt(5), an irrational number.
Clearly phi, the Golden Ratio, is not transcendental
since it is the solution of an algebraic equation:
phi = [sqrt(5) - 1]/2 = (5^[1/2] - 1)/2
One of my own amateur mathematical discoveries
(I've not seen it published elsewhere, at any rate)
is an infinite number series given by the iterated absolute 
log of K, where K is an integer.  I believe (but cannot
prove) that the scale-steps given by the terms of
this series form a non-just non-equal-tempered
scale.
This is a peculiar and interesting series of numbers
since the terms oscillate between 0 and 1.  The first
term is transcendental, but I have not been able to
prove that the succeeding terms are (or are not)
transcendental.
For instance, the first 10 terms of the iterated 
abs log of 2 are:
i[1] = abs(log(2)) = 0.30103...
i[2] = abs(log(i[1])) = 0.5213902...
i[3] = abs(log(i[2])) = 0.2828372...
i[4] = abs(log(i[3])) = 0.5484636...
i[5] = abs(log(i[4])) = 0.2608521...
i[6] = abs(log(i[5])) = 0.2338806...
i[7] = abs(log(i[6])) = 0.6310057...
i[8] = abs(log(i[7])) = 0.1999666...
i[9] = abs(log(i[8])) = 0.6990424...
i[10] = abs(log(i[9])) = 0.1554964...
and so on.
There does not appear to be an obvious
pattern to the terms.
If one were so inclined, one might call
this the McLaren series: this is surely
the first post on this tuning forum to
feature an original mathematical
discovery, albeit a trivial one.
As can be seen, all of the above methods
for generating transcendental numbers
can produce an infinite variety of 'em.
Depending on the pattern of generators
(the numbers you plug into the various
equations to produce transcendental
numbers), you get an endless variety of
non-just non-equal-tempered scales.
The choice of whether to terminate the
series with a 2/1 or not is a matter
of taste.  (One might call it "terminating
the series with extreme prejudice.")
In that case, one obtains a non-just
non-equal-tempered scale which repeats
at the octave.  Choosing another termination
integer (or irrational) would produce a
non-just non-equal-tempered scale without
octaves.
As can readily be seen, these are the obverse
of the equal tempered class of octave and
non-octave scales.  My limited experiments
with non-just non-equal-tempered octave
and n-j n-e-t non-octave scales appear to
show that there is a marked  difference in "sound"
between the two classes of tunings.  As Gary
Morrison so aptly put it, "non-octave scales
sound like rich thick chocolate milk shakes."
They are very exotic and harmonically rich,
and seem to have a sonic colouration which
lends an eldritch quality to the compositions
one produces in such scales.  
For n-j n-e-t non-octave scales, the same
appears to be true, only more so.  They are
among the most exotic and sonically luxuriant
of all tunings in my experience, and an
extraordinary realm for new music exploration.
