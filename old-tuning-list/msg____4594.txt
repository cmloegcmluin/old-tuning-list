Matt Nathan,

	    I have heard too much music from around the world performed vocally and 
on continuous-pitch instruments which nonetheless gravitates toward a small 
set of pitches to dismiss this as a result of the practicalities of 
instrument making or other temporal or geographic biases. These pitch sets 
are often very idiosyncratic and rarely contain any semblances of small 
integers beyond the 3-limit.

Which 3 intervals? I mentioned 4, and I did not specify the number of times 
each occurs, except to say that the last occurs once. Well, numbering the 
four intervals in question from 1 to 4, they go like this: 1 2 3 2 1 4 2 3 
2. That adds up to a 4/3. I play this piece so much that people are humming 
long sequences of successive 55-cent intervals, which tells me it's good 
enough to include on my first tape of 22-tone music (I'm still waiting for 
the guitar, though) despite its having nothing to do with my theories. So 
I'll keep it to myself for now.
