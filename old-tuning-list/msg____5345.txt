   Perhaps it's a little unfortunate that Mark didn't choose 9:7 for the
supramajor rather than 21:16.  But then again, 19 doesn't really provide
for supramajors and subminors as such;  it really only provides for
differences between augmented intervals and the next higher interval class.


   In other words, since in 19 the 7-step interval is really an augmented
third rather than a supramajor, since it is roughly equally far above the
major third as the minor third is below it.  A supramajor third would have
to be roughly half as far above the major third as the minor third is below
it.  21:16 is definitely an augmented third.

   7:6, however, definitely is subminor, being about a quartertone below
the minor third.  So I guess it's a little asymmetrical there.

   Ah!  This terminology and symmetry concerns only go so far;  what
matters is that you make great music with it!  I'd like to hear some
whenever you have a chance to make some.

   By the way, Lydia Ayers has also worked with a Just 19-toned scale.  I
don't recall the ratios off the top of my head though.
