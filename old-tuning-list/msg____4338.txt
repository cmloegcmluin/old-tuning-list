Subject: kick ass chops explained better

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...Jon, your comment that chops aren't enough is quite
correct...however, I believe the misunderstanding is my fault...when
I say chops, I actually include the realm of compositional skills as
well as athletic dexterity...I believe someone can compose a great
piece (Greensleeves comes to mind) without the piece needing to be
particularly difficult to play...I do find, alsa, that a lot of folks
with good/great technical skills can be quite boring if these skills
are not formed into interesting compositions...a blend of great
execution and compositional abilities is ideal...and hard to find...
