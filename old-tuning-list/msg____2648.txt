There is also a video called, get this: 

Enclosure 1. 
Four historic art films by Madeline Tourtelot with
music by Harry Partch.

includes: 
Rotate the Body in All It's Planes (1961, 9:00)
Music Studio - Harry Partch (1958, 17:48)
U.S. Highball (1958, completed 1968, 24:18)
Windsong (1958, 17:38)
and a 12 page booklet with Harry Partch's own introductions.

I like Music Studio the best. Harry demo's the instruments.
Rotate is bizarre with a gymnastics display.

There's also a book called Enclosure 3. I haven't seen that yet.
