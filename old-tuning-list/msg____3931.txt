Let's change the example to a chord written F:Bb7:Eb7 (1/1, 21/16, 7/4)
	-The bass plays F, no problem.
	-The soprano sees Eb7, and plays Eb approximately a quartertone
flat, knowing to tune a "7" relationship because she has the "7"
diacritical.
	-The alto sees Bb7, but must tune a complex interval.  She sees the
"7", but doesn't know how to tune it since she is a bit lower than a 4/3
from the bass--no man's land.  Since she sees the cue (Eb7) written in her
part, she sees that the soprano pitch is a 4/3 above hers, and knows to
which pitch she should tune her simple relationship.

Another example: what if the bass moves from F (1/1) to GL+ (8/7), and then
the alto must play a 5/4 from this new fundamental?  She would see in her
part BL+ over a cue (GL+), and knows to hear a 5/4 in relation to the bass
rather than some kind of seventh.

A 9/5 minor seventh would come under my "easy to hear" interval
classifications.  Since nobody sees a "7" they know not to tune too far
away from their "home" chromatic scale.  If I wanted an F#+ (45/32) in the
chord C:F#+:G (1/1, 45/32. 3/2), I would give the alto an F#+ over a cue
(D).

Pardon my ambiguity, I hope that this is clearer.

-Adam
