Fellow keyboard enthusiasts:

I would like to invite you all to our new web site:  "Software Solutions
for Piano Technicians".  For you convenience I've made my products
available via the Internet.
You can visit us at:

 www.reyburn.com

To get the latest scoop on Sanderson Accu-Tuners & accessories, and our
Tuning Manager, and Piano Service Manager software for Macintosh and PC
computers.

The Sanderson Accu-Tuner is the most accurate and versatile keyboard
instrument tuning system available.  I have a special version available
pre-loaded with 57+ historical temperaments (even equal temperament ;-)

I also list where I will be teaching classes on aural and electronic
tuning at Piano Technicians Guild Seminars.

Our page has links to some neat places you may not have seen before that
relate to pianos, keyboards and tuning.

If you don't have access to the "World Wide Web" please feel free to send
me email at:

 dean@reyburn.com

for information on our products.

I you just want to chat, that's ok too!

Dean
