Subject: Markov analysis

From: Lindsay Shaw and Paul Turner <landp@adelaide.dialix.oz.au>

In TUNING Digest 743, Brian McLaren mentions, among other things,
"Markov-chain analysis": "...produces junk when you use it to analyze a
piece of music and then compose an algorithmic piece. ... ."

I don't question that there is something in his claim, but I would be
grateful if someone could explain what Markov-chain analysis is. Are we
perhaps talking about calculating the probabilities (relative
frequencies) of the various melodic intervals in a sample piece?

I'm attempting a study of mathematical applications in music, and this is
one I hadn't heard of (at least by that name). Maybe someone can point me
to a suitable reference or say who has used this technique.
