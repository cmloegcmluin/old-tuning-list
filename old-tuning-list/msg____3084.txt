Subject: Unusual Instrument Mail Order

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

This is not tuning-related strictly speaking, but I suspect that many of you
might find it interesting anyway.  I saw a catalog yesterday for a company
called "Lark in the Morning".  They mail-order a wide variety of unusual musical
instruments, mostly older Western and from other cultures.  They seem to have an
almost impossibly big variety, from straight fanfare trumpets, to sitars and
tamburas, to clavichord kits.  

   Their ph# (US) is (707) 964-5569.  I have no experience with them (yet), so I
have no information, positive nor negative, about the quality of their
merchandise or service.
