Subject: Corrupting our youth (a call for help)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

This was forwarded from the ICMA mailing list. Which of you learned
souls wants to recruit microtonalists from among our young? :-)

To whom it may concern:

My name is Alison Marlowe, and I am a 10th grader in Illinois.  I am
interested, if it is available, in information which has to do with
mathematics and its relation to music, specifically tuning and scales.  Any
literature (emailed, please) or other sources (such as from a professor)
would be highly appreciated.  A bit of a hurry is requested, because the
report is due 12-17-96.  Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,
Alison Marlowe
10th grade student
