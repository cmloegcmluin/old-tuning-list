Henry Rosenthal, whose apartment is "The Just Intonation Store," had one
copy left for sale as of last summer--I believe on lp, but possibly
cassette.  No CDs.  As far as I know, the recording has been completely
discontinued and  LaMonte Young doesn't even have extra copies for sale.

The old adage "you are what you eat" seems to be pertinent here.  The
sounds that we surround ourselves with have strong affects on our moods,
and in the long-term must be considered to have "positive" or "negative"
influence.  Tuning cannot be considered to be the only musical attribute
that affects our development in this manner, and Johnston realizes this.
In his music he has tried many approaches (which vary in their degrees of
abstraction and modernism) to express an orderly sound-world.

I don't agree with Johnston's appraisal of rock music as being irrational.
It seems to me that rock is overly rigid and simple.  If I have any
complaint with rock in general, it is the machine-like rigidity of it; rock
jackhammers over our lives with gew moments of repose and a general
disregard for large-scale phrasing.  In my mind, this has a tiring and
confusing effect (when I pay attention--and a boring  effect when I don't).

Johnston doesn't deal with equal temperaments other than 12TET, and hasn't
composed in 12TET for years.  His comments shouldn't be taken to express
disdain for equal temperaments which approximate Just Intonation except
that scales are judged against the yardstick of the overtone series, and
the roughness created from acoustic beating in equal temperaments
translates into roughness in our lives.  Remember also the complexity is
not bad, it is "illogical complexity" that our minds do not follow.  Maybe
if we listened to a "healthy" music made up of logical tunings, timbres,
rhythms, etc., we would be a little more relaxed.  Then we can move onto
painting the walls earthtones...

Yours,
Adam
