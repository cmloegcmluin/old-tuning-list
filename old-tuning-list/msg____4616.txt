I was under the impression that having 1 (or 2) as a factor was common, 
based on some material John sent me, which led me to the discovery I 
mentioned in my comment on Kami's post. It certainly is not a trivial factor 
and seems to aid in the geometrical interpretation of these things. Without 
a 1 (or 2), the CPS is just a "border" between these tiled hyperpolyhedra. 
Whether or not you assume octave equivalence doesn't alter the 
dimensionality of a given CPS, as far as I can see, since no 
octave-equivalent pairs of tones are present. An exception would have to be 
made in the case of 2 appearing as a factor along with the repetition of 
other factors, but John said,

On another point:


>to measure distances between intervals use the Minkowski metric
>(Tenney's harmonic distance)

I would dispute this, since it takes the axes as orthogonal, contrary to my 
view of Euler geni (?) as oblique. Tenney would view 6/5 as spanning the 
same harmonic distance as 16/15, that distance being log(3)+log(5)g(15), 
while I would argue that the former (and its octave equivalence class) is 
simpler and so should be represented by a shorter distance.

Here's how I would measure distance. I take each axis as representing a new 
prime number, starting with 3. In two dimensions (5-limit), the solution is 
to make major triads or 1)3 [1.3.5] CPS, and minor triads or 2)3 [1.3.5] 
CPS, isosceles triangles (which fill the plane) where the three edges 3/1, 
5/1, and 5/3 have length log(3), log(5), and log(5), respectively (i.e., the 
length is the log of the limit). By contrast, Tenney would take these 
lengths as log(3), log(5), and log(15), respectively, so that the consonant 
triads are no more compact in space than a chord like 12:15:16.

In three dimensions (7-limit or 9-limit), one additionally represents 7/1, 
7/3, and 7/5 as edges of length log(7), and space is littered with 
transpositions of 1)4 [1.3.5.7] and 3)4 [1.3.5.7] tetrads (otonal and 
utonal, in Partch language), which have one of each of the six edge types 
(are these called isosceles tetrahedra?), and the "holes" are filled with 
transpositions of the 2)4 [1.3.5.7] hexany (isosceles octahedra?), which 
have two of each of the six edge types. 9-limit constructs are not as pretty 
geometrically, but the math works out: assuming you travel along edges only 
(is this what is meant by the Minkowski metric? My relativity teacher didn't 
think so!), an interval is consonant with respect to the n-limit if the 
shortest distance needed to traverse the interval is less than or equal to 
log(n), since log(3)+log(3)g(9), etc.

The practical problem with these metrics is that they don't take "punning" 
into account. Eventually a really distant point will sound like a really 
close one. A simple, accurate, and consistent temperament can remedy this 
situation, but only with more (euclidean) dimensions around which to "wrap" 
the lattices. For example, the set of meantone temperaments makes three 
steps of 3/1 the same as one step of 5/3. So the plane becomes a tube. This 
tube may still be infinitely long, though, and so will have punning 
problems. But meantone equal temperaments like 12 and 19 cut it off and 
attach the two ends together, making a torus. The geometric distance between 
any two tones is then a good indication of how consonant the interval 
between them is.
