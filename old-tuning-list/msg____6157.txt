Subject: Barbershop and Equal-Step Tuning

As regards Mr. Szanto's thread on Barbershop....

You've got to watch it, with all these people using "tet" instead of "tone
equal temperament".  Does anyone like this nomenclature?  Why not call
equal-step tunings by the size of the step, or maybe by the number of
divisions per space (I referred to 12tet in each of these ways in a previous
posting to try them out, "100 equal" and "12:2 equal" respectively), as both
of these are consistent for octave and non-octave based temperaments.  Any
ideas?  I can say I am not particularly endeared to McLaren's favorite
Xtyith root of Nth scheme, found in Xenharmonikon 14.

Anyway, all Barbershop is 4-part, be it quartet or chorus.  Barbershop is a
unique type of style-> rigidly defined by the one organization that saved
it, and then made it, www.SPEBSQSA.org.

I sing with my local Barbershop chorus, and I have found it highly
rewarding, both for my vocal technique and for my understanding of the 7-limit.

And on the topic of choral work, I think we should dispatch at once quartets
to sing in the 13-limit.  A Society for the Encouragement of Just Intonation
Choral Singing at www.SEJICS.org?  Why not?

As regards Paul Hahn's statements on 22 vs. 24 equal step/octave tunings....

I for one would be interested in anything you've got on this.  I think I
remember seeing this term "consistency" in an article in an old issue of the
Xenharmonikon, but I didn't understand it until now.  Thanks, Paul!

There was also another term that Ivor used, "symmetry".  He never defined it
too well, but he complained that 12-tone was too symmetric, and that when
one first began Xenharmonic exploration, it was crucial to "knock the ear
out" with a non-symmetric tuning like 19-tone.  Could this be the same
thing, Ivor's term for consistency?

Wouldn't it be nice to have a chart that measured both the "approximation"
and "consistency" values for each limit for each temperament?
