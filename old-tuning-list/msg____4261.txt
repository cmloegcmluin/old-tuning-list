I must agree with Neil that actually playing music to the appreciation of 
audiences is quite nutricious to one's musical well-being in 
composition.  Roger Sessions wrote that music was at its greatest when 
composers play their own music and are the greatest listeners to what 
they both play and create.

Any composer that spends even a little time performing and developing 
chops will achieve greater success in their compositions.  (Both my 
intellect and my intuition concur, which I take to be a good enough sign 
to take a risk and make the statement.)

Thank you all you delurkers, wherever you are.  I hope you continue to 
gain sustenance from the combination tones of this list.

I'll be in Toronto for the December 14th Critical Band concert at the 
Music Gallery.   I will be performing my solo Dune for bassoon, Eye of 
Newt for alto recorder - both polymicrotonal - the majority of Li Po with 
Marc Sabat on his own adapted viola.  Also schedule are 2 31ET pieces and 
some JI for ensembles by John Gzowski.  Hope to meet some Torontoers like 
Paul Rapoport et al.

Also, please check out the latest newsletter of the British Harry Partch 
Society.  And see also their latest journal which has an alternative text 
to a major Partch work that is quite colorful...and which has the use of 
"chromo" as an abbreviation for chromelodeon."  (Gotcha, Jon).

Back to NYC on Dec. 16th.  (Hope Brian and the "Wolf" don't blow down any 
houses.) (G) (g) (.) ( ) O o .
