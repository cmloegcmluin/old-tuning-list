Subject: FP Collaborations/Reflective Space Concerts

From: muslp@luxor.latrobe.edu.au

Just wanted to let anyone know on this list who's working on 
the 1 minute FP Colalboration (Chris Mann-source) pieces
that Lawrence Harvey would like to perform a number of them on
the Melbourne Reflective Spaces concerts in November. Deadline for
Lawrence or I to get the finished DAT's or CD's is November 1
for this venue, but still no deadline for the CD. As a reminder
the source and details are at

http://music.calarts.edu/FrogPeakCD.html

and 

http://online.anu.edu.au/ITA/ACAT/tjk/FrogPeak.aiff

and at a hard drive near you.

best
lp
