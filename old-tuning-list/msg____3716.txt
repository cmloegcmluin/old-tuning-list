Subject: Breaking stride (airplay, perhaps?)

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

As I think I've mentioned before, my weekly radio program on the local
Pacifica affiliate usually collects and sequences a bunch of music with
little regard for genre. The usual wheezy joke pictures me as enticing
impressionable youth to a lifetime of Darmstadt honkin' and tweetin'.
I think that a look at http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~gtaylor/RTQE.html
ought to provide a more nuanced view. Well, lately I've been turning
over the thought of doing a *whole* fenced-off special of work in
other tunings; a program which might include your work.

There are a couple of things that led me to this decision. First, I've
been routinely getting queries lately whenever I run non12TET work
(most recently, it happened that some David First and Jukka Tiensuu
and Alistair Riddell wound up coming one after another completely
by accident), and I'm reminded that I've not done an all non12TET
show for years.

Second, I think that my colleague Arthur and I will be trying to procure
an extra hour+ from our late-night/red-eye pal gwillard and running
all of LaMonte Young's "The Well-Tuned Piano" at some point in the near
future. It's been six or seven years since we've done it, and the time
seems right.

Finally, I asked local wunderkind Bill Sethares if he'd be interested in
coming on RTQE and playing some music and talking about his work
before he turned world traveller. I'll be getting to it sometime this
fall or early winter.

This clustering suggests that maybe it's time to solicit your advice
and your recordings, should you be interested in contributing to
such a project. If you've got any advice on what you think would be
a nice "here's what's possible outside of 12TET" show [for an erudite
but "normal" radio audience], drop me a line. I may already have
some examples of your work [certainly Larry Polansky, and Ted
Mook and and the Artifact folks have been great, and Carter Scholz
has kept me up on the occasional Just Intonation tape releases,
for example. I know that you're probably not in the habit of doling
out promos like candy, so it's best to be prudent before you start
posting me stuff I already have]. Length will eventually be a concern;
you'd be surprised at just how quickly 2 hours of uninterrupted
airtime can fill up. I'd very much like to keep the announcer's
blathering to a minimum in order to maximize the time for
cortical damage, as well.

In a sense, I'd also be interested in what some of you view as more
or less "canonical" pieces [for example, which Wendy Carlos from
Beauty in the Beast would I run?] as well. I think it might be best
to take this to email.

I'll let you know as things progress.

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
