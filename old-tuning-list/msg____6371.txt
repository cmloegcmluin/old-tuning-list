Press Commentary on Exhibition:

"... the multifaceted form of the 35-frequency
construction of Young's current installation is
the principal reason it changes hallucinogenically
with every shift in perspective and why the tones
freeze in place as long as one is perfectly still
while the slightest gesture will startle forth
unnamable, wildly plumed melodies from the luxuriant
harmonic foliage. Zazeela's light sculptures have
invariably, teasingly refused to surrender their
entire secret to photographic reprodution, so much
do they depend on the retinal impact of activated
photons in real time and so much do they exploit,
in ways analagous to Young's techniques, the creation
of visual combination tones and an accumulation of
after-images."

-- Sandy McCroskey, 1/1, The Journal of the Just Intonation Network


"Young's newest sine-tone sculpture shimmers
and swirls as you walk around the room and,
amazingly, when you freeze, it does too. Stay
at least long enough to stare at Zazeela's
Imagic Light and Ruine Window, which will
imprint your retina with blues and
purples you haven't felt before."

-- Kyle Gann, The Village Voice


"The visitor with an acute ear can actually
'play' the room like an instrument: explore
the sound close to the wall, close to the floor,
in the corner, or just standing still. Or lie
on the floor and allow the sound to float you
into heaven, slide you into hell, or transport
you wherever you want to go. See if you agree
with those who call Young's sound sculpture
a precursor of ambient music.

Zazeela's light installation, "Imagic Light,"
offers an intriuging complement to the sound,
even though it is equally effective when viewed
in silence. Using pairs of colored lights and
suspended aluminum mobiles cut out in calligraphic
shapes, Zazeela explores the relationship between
object and shadow, making the tangible intangible,
and vice versa. Enjoy the installation for its
mesmerizing beauty, or try to analyze how the
different colors are achieved, how the mobiles
create the resulting shadows, or perspective
the infinite number of symmetrical patterns in the
room."

-- David Farneth, Metrobeat
