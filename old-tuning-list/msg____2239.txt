Hmmm.  Sorry if I'm beating (no pun intended) a dead horse, but didn't 
Kirnberger say that Bach tuned with all Major 3rds sharp, but none 
Pythagorean?

Mind you, I like the Kellner temperament - a local organ is tuned in it - 
but I just wonder if one of Neidhardt's temperaments is more what Bach 
had in mind (if Kirnberger is right - odd that K himself devised 
temperaments which didn't fit this description).
