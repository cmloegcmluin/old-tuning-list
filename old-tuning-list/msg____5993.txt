Subject: Re: Semitones etc.

From: "Andrew L. Kaye" <androsky@fast.net>

Re: the debate over nomenclature and the proper definition of terms such
as semitone vs. half step vs. m2, etc.  I think it well illustrates the
problems arising from the confused and overlapping terminology that we
generally encounter in musicology.  In linguistics, there is an
international phonetic alphabet, and linguists are able to identify
dozens of degrees of difference in the pronunciation of the letter "a",
for example.  Well, people around the world use different sized
intervals, whether we want to call them "whole tones", "half tones",
"fifths" or whatever.  What we need to do is join in an organized
endeavor to identify and name all the possible intervals that are
actually used by human beings.  Whom on this list would be interested in
embarking on such a project?  (My interest in what people actually
do--and have done historically--around the world betrays my training as
an ethnomusicologist; but isn't this what musicology or music theory in
general should build its theories on?).
