Ah yes, 'black noise'

The fundamental problem with a black noise generator is that unless the
wavelength of the sound being cancelled out in the air is significantly
greater than the distance between the sound source and the black noise
source, it produces an interference pattern rather than simply cancelling
out.

Cancelling beats has much the same problem, my solution is to play
everything out of one speaker, in which case the distance between the
cancelling source and the beating source is zero (unless you get into the
distance between the woofer and the tweeter, which I'm *hoping* won't
become a problem.) I suspect it's just plain impossible to get that sort
of effect out of normal acoustic instruments. 

I'm now buying the two books people mentioned, and will hopefully be able
to work out some formulas after reading through them. The main thing I'm
still unclear on at the moment is how to compute volume, although at the
moment I suspect it's based on the integral of the square of the second
derivative of f(x). Hopefully I'll know for sure after doing my homework.
