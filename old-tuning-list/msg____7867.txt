Subject: Just Intonation-Specific MailingList

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

I agree whole-heartedly and practically to the
letter with everything Graham Breed said about
not splitting up this list, and if it does split up,
how to split it.

I think a single forum for TUNING, in all its aspects,
is more valuable than anything specific could be,
at least at this stage of the game.  It's still early on
in the battle to rid the world of 12-eq dominance,
and I think it's healthiest to air all of our different
concerns in this one place.
