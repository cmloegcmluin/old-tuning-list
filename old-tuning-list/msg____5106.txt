The chord should be tuned as it is written. It is easiest relate this
chord to the root of its tonic (or resolution chord), so C E F# A#
should be analysed relative to B.

In any meantone system, therefore, C should be tuned as the minor second
above the tonic (in J.I. that is 16/15), the E as the perfect fourth
above the tonic (in J.I. that is 4/3), the F# as the perfect fifth above
the tonic (in J.I. that is 3/2) and the A# as the major seventh above
the tonic (in J.I. that is 15/8).

I have expressed elsewhere why I think it is inappropriate, in such a
context, to view any of these intervals as 7-limit ratios (despite their
similarity).

The origin of this chord is as a chromatic alteration of the second
inversion of F# dominant 7th. It should not be treated as a strange
xenharmonic consonant entity introduced entirely out of context with the
rest of the tonality.
