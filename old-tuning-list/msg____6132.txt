Jon has always had a rejoinder waiting around the corner for me.
Sometimes when I read his responses to my posts I begin to think I'm a
different person, but only for a moment <G>.  He is so persuasive...and
funny. I am determined to address his points and to avoid a flame at all
costs.  Oh, I don't believe in God, but I do believe in details.

It has been described that jazz uses sharp sharps and flat flats, but
blues have organic microtones.  Great blues artists are on record for
avoiding the piano because they would be inhibited intonationally by the
inflexible pitch of the piano (e.g. Robert Johnson).

Most of my post
involves determinations by ear, since scores and theory are unavailable
(or undesired).  Rap often uses a keyboard in 1/8th tones (even En Vogue
sings in 1/8th tones in You're Never Gonna Get It.)  And the guitars
get pitches/intervals in lots of ways other than
refrettings.  Whammy-bars, restringings, scalloping between frets, studio
effects and manipulations are the tip of an iceberg.  (Yes, I'm
optomistic.)

So many exclamations above.  Please don't reduce what I am saying to
farce.  While one always tunes to the instrument present that is most
inflexible to pitch, singers and wind players and fretless players are
never obliged to play only those set "ghetto" pitches.  Even slendro
allows for extra notes to its basic 5!  The piano is a 19th century
instrument, after all.

As a bassoonist playing regularly to Pink Floyd, I normally used just
thirds in order to harmonize along.  This is quite recognizeable to me
since I need to used my "special" fingerings in order to be in tune.
Miles Davis recordings likewise use microtones throughout, but usually
from a modal perspective where different fingerings are utilized.

I guess your reactions mean that you accept the microtonality of Odetta
(she does) or of Louis Armstrong (analyzed microtonally by Ezra Sims) or
Albert King (known for his emphasis of the 13th harmonic).  How about the
comma in the melody of Sinead O'Connor's Compare?

I believe there a smile on your face, Jon when you say much of this, only
because of past exchanges.  Michael Bolton sings his share of microtones.
Kenny G plays them.  Maybe there's more in others yet unmentioned.  The
important thing here -- at least to me -- is that there is a soup of
interval useage out there in the real world of music, and that includes
pop.  (See a new article in an upcoming Whole Earth Magazine issue on
microtonal music mainstreaming of my authorship...and they called me!)

Pop musicians use the history of music as a jumping off point to further
reaches and even legitimitization of techniques.  The above gentleman
helped secure the use of microtones.  Didn't you know that the Grateful
Dead listened to Ives #4 before each live performance during an entire
year?  Or that they were financial supporters to the premiere of the Ives
Universe Symphony?

Copland used quartertones in some of his music and is thus listed in
numerous reference books.  These works include Dance Symphony, Ukele
Serenade, and Vitebsk.  The Copland Performance Fund has been a supporter
of the AFMM since its inception several years back, incidentally.

The almost pop John Cage loved the sounds you are teasing about.  His
_Ten_ is in 74ET and is 30 minutes long for 10 players and it sounds like
NYC traffic.  More specifically to your question: Kyle Gann is a
microtonalist critic for The Village Voice and regularly supports and
encourages tiny tone touching.  John Schaefer is station manager of WNYC
the now-independent important radio station with the award winning New
Sounds show, which he hosts and sends off to NPR...and a microtonal music
enthusiast.  WKCR has always had microtonal emphasis since my
involvement in 1981 and that of other key people (Frank Oteri, Charles
Passy, etc.)  The New York Times regularly features positive reviews about
microtonal groups and events (I blush at the exposure) and recall the
moving on of microtonal ethusiast critic Robert Palmer.  And there are
others like Roulette (run by microtonal composer David Weinstein), the
Kitchen (run by music curator and microtonalist Ben Neill), or
microtonalist Phill Niblock's series.  These people have been in place way
over a decade.

The name Harry Partch is etched in many minds as having been an
institution of San Diego.  How it is manifested since is another issue.
Interval, however, was very important for over a decade in providing
valuable information on microtonal music for over a decade.  I'm sorry to
hear that things have fallen into a shabby state in San Diego.
Incidentally, Ivor Darreg was a one-man-institution if there ever was one
in San Diego and it is due to his Xenharmonicon that much of tuning theory
and early obscure writers on the subject from other lands first received
American exposure.

Jon, Neil's idea is my idea, and everyone in the pop world's idea.  We all
write killer music and distribute the gems far and wide.  Got it.

It is unneccessary, however, to ignore the music in our envirnoment right
now.  I have described the NYC sound scene in more detail.
Understandably, each location will have different input.  How about
everyone, what positives are there to report across the U.S. and in Europe
(Paris, Amsterdam,...)
