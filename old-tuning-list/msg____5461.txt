   Certainly limiting your vocabulary to either is significant.  ETs and
JI, by all means, are both very valuable to explore.

   You slightly nudged one of my hot buttons, so I'll push it down the rest
of the way and then *try* to restrain myself from continuing to yack about
it after this message!

   ETs and JI can both limit your vocabulary.  But limits are good.  Limits
stimulate rather than stiffle creativity.  If you have unlimited
flexibility to solve a compositional problem, then the solution will be
arbitrarily easy to devise, and that's boring.  When you operate within
limits, you have to devise clever and exciting solutions to compositional
tasks, which is much more interesting.  And more fun too.

   Cute!  I like that.
