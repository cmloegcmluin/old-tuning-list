Subject: Re: TUNING digest 875

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

In studying the issue of notation, I believe we are losing sight of the 
difference between 1)symbolic representation of on paper and 2) hearing 
interval relationships exactly.

12-tone ET notation does not guarantee that a player can _hear_ the exact 
relationships indiated on hard copy by convention.  In fact, 
_professional_ playing involves alterations to an absolute for reasons of 
expressions (e.g. leadings, mellowings, nuances, resonances).

Hard copy notation can never supplant actual internalizing of new 
intervals (more accurately presented in the mind than on paper).

Re: Adam's comments: there is no just 4/5/6 triad in my string quartet
Cosmic Rays.  I suspect, having talked with Adam about this last spring,
that the heterophonic "unason" on a Ptolemy-indicated Phrygian scale (c.
200 A.D. Alexandria) with its melodically outlined 5/4 of 386 cents was 
scalding in
its perceived muddle.  Not trying to make excuses for honest imperfections
in a premiere performance, further performances better chiselled out 
delicate ensemble playing.
  
I might suggest that a new composition rightfully "rifles" the 
expectations of listeners who have studiously researched that which 
already exists in music.  The Ives _Universe_ reviews demonstrated to me 
the reality that each reviewer hears in an entirely different way.  
(Stunning, really, when compared to informed commentary by those more 
familiar with the sound product first hand.)

Re: systems, I don't believe there is any virtue in sticking to a 
particular system of tuning, per se.  Anyone care to comment?
