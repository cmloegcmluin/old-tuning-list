Hi Matt;

I attempted to post the following message in reply to your missive
via cix.co.uk (my regisered address at mills.edu)
When I tried to access bix by tymnet I got "site shut" message.
I am therefore sending it to you with the hope that you will forward it to
tuning list.
(with this note to explain its origins)
TIA
Charles Lucy

The model and mapping is very straight-forward and is (I hope clearly)
explained at our website (www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullabies)
in the download and techie areas, plus John Harrison's writings.
 
I shall restate it, as briefly as possible.
 
(complete with formulae and numbers)
 
It seems that by taking steps of fourths and fifths, from a given pitch,
all "harmonics" (ghosttones?) can be mapped in a continuous series.
The interval between the fourth and the fifth is exactly [1200/(2*pi)190.9858 cents] . This interval Harrison called the "larger" interval.
I have used the term "Large"(L).
 
One octave (Ratio exactly 2) is 5 Large (L) plus 2 small (s) intervals.
Harrison called the "small (s)" interval the "lesser" interval.
 
Therefore the "small" interval (s) is {1200 - (5*L)}/2 122.5354 cents.
 
 
To this basic formula, I have added some musical terms and
further rules.
 
 
440Hz is called A4.
Steps of fourths produce flats and multiple flats.
Steps of fifths produce sharps and multiple sharps.
 
Scales may then be mapped as additions and subtractions of Large (L)
and small (s) intervals.
 
It seems that notes, which are closer on the spiral of fifths and 
fourths are more consonant than those which are a greater number of
steps apart..
 
      
 
 
>Actually it is theories, not laws, which compete.
 
To my mind a theory becomes a "Law", when it becomes sufficiently widely
accepted as a "scientific truth" to supersede all previous and 
contradictory "Laws". At any one time there are often competing theories.
 
Eg "Creationism v Darwinism".
 
True, the theories do compete, and particularly successful theories
eventually compete against the "Laws".
 
Karl Popper "On the logic of scientific discovery" writes on the 
shortcomings of this logic.
 
I was looking for a better model for tunings and frequency analysis
than Just Intonation provides.

Ask the JI advocates where the "harmonics" (ghosttones?) are.

See above re. pi.
 
Your suspicions may well be true, yet the obvious irrational and
transcendental numbers are all related (pi, Phi, e, etc.)

I suspect that there is more to Harrison's dogmatic insistence on
this particular interval of 2^(1/(2*pi))
(The two pi root of two) as the Large (larger) L interval),
than merely convenient arithmetic. 
 
The more I that learn about the current "science" of acoustics;
the more I believe that it is built on shaky foundations. 
 
If you read best selling biography "Longitude" by Dava Sobel
Walker 1996, you will find that Harrison was a meticulous
scientist and horologist.

Good let's do that!
