Subject: The magnificient senventh...

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

My playing experience taught me that jazz uses 4:5:6:7 chords most
of the time. The 'flat' seventh really puts the chord its "cool" or
"relaxed" context.
Playing a 16/9 on top of a jazz chord just kills the feeling. But, some jazz
uses 5-limit 7th chords, and classical music uses it all the time (almost by
definition.)

        The 16/9 in the classical seventh chords (1 5/4 3/2 16/9 or sometimes
3/4 16/9 2/1 ) gives a very serious, or conventional, feel to the music.
This afternoon, I realised how much this conventional effect, this expected
effect is important.

        I was playing the last stranza of the aida march in the key of F
major. Here it is in GWBasic notation with the chords on top : (is there a
better name for this kind of notation?) I separated in bars, the first one
starting on the second beat. 

Tempo : approx 60bpm for the quarternote

        Cm              F7              G7                      C
    G   G.G8    >C.C8   EbD     C<A     GA12G12F12      ED      C1

        The Eb in the first F7 bar is the climax of the phrase. I was using
a new trumpet today, a Jerome Callet Soloist. I hadn't tested the intonation
of the horn before playing. When I played the high Eb, using the 5th
harmonic and 2nd valve pressed, (theorically 5/4 of C, minus 100cents) when
I played this, the trumpet played the 7/4 of F!!!! Believe me, a note 36/35
lower then the classical 16/9 sound REALLY WEIRD!!!!!! The note was a full
quartertone off! I will be traumatised for a few days. This note sounded
really wrong.

I would like to have everyone's feedback:
What is your opinion on sevenths? What is the difference between 16/9 and
9/5? (I you tell me that the difference is a comma, I will have to kill you.
What I want to know is when to use the two different intervals.)
