Subject: Re: Music and the Brain

From: "BRIAN B. CARLSON"  <bricarls@du.edu>

My name is Brian Carlson, I live in Denver and play a 19 tone steel 
string acoustic guitar and another with the frets spaced at the following 
ratios - 21/20  9/8  7/6  6/5  5/4  21/16  4/3  7/5  35/24  3/2  14/9  
8/5  5/3  7/4  9/5  15/8 and 35/18.   Mark Rankin worked out these ratios 
to include the 7 limit ratios and also keep the frets spaced far enough 
apart to be playable.  Jon Starrett did a great job on refretting both 
instruments.

The study involving Mozart and IQ testing raises some interesting 
issues.  When we listen to music, everything and anything that is 
contained in a piece of music can enter into one's brain (at various 
levels of consciousness) and become part of an unbelievably complex state 
of affairs.  Really, when you are listening to Mozart, in a sense you are 
hearing Mozart's mind in the music.  Music is a very powerful form of 
communication.  One's deepest thoughts and feelings can be communicated 
through music and when we listen to music, the style and structure of the 
music can stimulate the brain in new and unknown (and difficult to 
quantify) ways. Perhaps the study should be performed again while one 
group of students listens to Stravinsky and the other to John Tesh. 

Anyway, relating to tuning, non 12et music will have very different 
structures than 12et music.  I am curious to hear what people think about 
microtonal music and the effects it has on their way of thinking.  How 
has playing or composing or listening to microtonal music changed the way 
you think about music, and has it had other effects as well?

This forum has been an excellent source of information on tuning, from 
the minute technical details to the universal implications of tuning, 
all extremely important.  Looking forward to hearing any ideas...
