Message text written by Neil H:

"condescension present, in the form of Sagan, which seemed to say, 
"there, there, don't take that mystical crap too seriously;" in fact, I 
do know Sagan represented a philosophy which I find ludicrous, namely 
that there is no ultimate Creator, and those who believe so are a little, 
shall we say, "old fashioned", or something to that effect."

   That could perhaps be true, but I read Carl Sagan a little differently. 


   He was outspoken against religious fanaticism, meaning cases where
people hurt others or the environment - in the ecological or social senses
of the word - in the name of a religious belief.  He was similarly
outspoken against the nationalistic and technological equivalents of that
sort of fanaticism, including for example wars driven by little more than
national pride, or using superior technology to obliterate a civilization. 


   As with our friend John C., Sagan was also down on pseudoscience,
meaning cases where people use incompletely or misdirectedly, or give the
impression of using, scientific methodology to advance a cause they are
particularly fond of.  A common example is citing evidence in favor of a
conclusion while (whether intentionally or not) ignoring evidence to the
contrary.  Also common is citing evidence based upon sample sizes that are
insignificant statistically.  Many pseudoscientific cases are also
presented with an attitude suggesting that their conclusion cannot be
refuted.

   Carl Sagan's attitude in matters where we just simply have no reliable
objective information about a question, or where the question is clearly
arbitrary from a scientific perspective is a different matter.  I
personally never got the impression of a condscending attitude toward those
who take a position such matters based solely upon a personal preference or
intuition of whatever sort.  His choices of music and sounds to put onto
his Voyager record, for example, were based upon very open and tolerant
attitudes toward human diversity.  

   I have long wondered what Sagan would have had to say about
Xenharmonics.  I suspect not much really, in the sense that I suspect that
he didn't have much experience with music as a whole.
