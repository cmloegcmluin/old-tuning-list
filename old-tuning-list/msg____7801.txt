I don't know where it came from, but it's true. Even Mathieu admits that
a 12-tone chromatic scale is melodically smoother in 12tET than in an
unequal tuning.

Note that in my paper, as clarified by you (Carl Lumma), I do not care
about the 5-limit accuracy of 22tET, only that its 7-limit accuracy be
at least as great as the 5-limit accuracy of 12tET. Also, I am
interested in scales that fulfill some but not all of the properties of
diatonicity as outlined in my paper, such as Blackwood's 10-note scale
in 15tET and a couple of 14-note scales in 26tET.

Actually, Easley Blackwood thinks that 12tET is much more usable and
"good" than any other tuning. See the interview in PNM. The funny thing
is that Blackwood's microtonal music is generally much better than
Darreg's.

If you mean the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then that might not be true,
although consistency will guarantee that it's true. If you don't mean
the best 11/8 and the best 9/8, then what do you mean?

Did you mean horrible thirds or strong 5s?
