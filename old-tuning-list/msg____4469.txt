Subject: Bulgarian music & emotional response

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Bruce,

I've looked in my own collection of Bulgarian music and there was no
CD with exactly 20 tracks so I don't know if this particular CD is for
sale somewhere.
But I can recommend the series "Le Myste`re des voix Bulgares", on the
Nonesuch label in the U.S., you can blindly buy all three volumes.
There are many CD's more, Tower Records should have several. There are
CD's of live performances, another one called "Le Mythe des voix Bulgares".
They are not all by the same choir though and quality may vary.
It's indeed wonderful music, I vividly remember the moment that I 
heard it for the first time on the radio, in the summer of '86.
There's also a nice series of CD's with traditional music assembled by
Herman Vuylsteke of the Flemish radio. 


Music that gives me the most emotional response is always vocal music
(with the exception of the Gran Partita), like the soprano-alt duet in 
Cantata BWV 91, Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, Schubert songs or Handel's 
cantata Lucrezia.
But I recall a talk by a music psychologist explaining that music has
five different kinds of appeal. I can't remember all of them. So I 
think John F. needn't be confused because the case will be that the 
different appeals will appeal with differing strength to different people.
