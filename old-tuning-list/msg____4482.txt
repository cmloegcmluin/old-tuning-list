   Yeah...  That's certainly true, and I can see value in keep definitions
as vague as we realistically can in this particular field.  Music is not a
precise science by any means.  Or accurately I should say that it's neither
precise nor a science!  

   But there's always the risk that nebulous definitions will cause
misunderstanding too, so I suppose it's something of a fine line to tread.
