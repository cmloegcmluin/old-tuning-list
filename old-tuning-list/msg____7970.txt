Dear Tuning -

some items of interest:

1) Just published: THE QUARTER-TONE RECORDER MANUAL by Kathryn 
Bennetts, Donald Boustead and Peter Bowman.  Moeck No 2084, Moeck 
Verlag Celle. 

I just recieved my copy, and it looks excellent.  All examples 
are for conventional alto recorder, it includes a separate fingering 
chart,  numerous 1/4 tone exercises,  a short work by Donald Bousted, 
and a list of about 30 existing 1/4 tone compositions for 
(or including) recorders.

Its about 50 pages altogether - and costs =A35 quid (pounds sterling) - 
which is very good value.

2) Heard on the grapevine that Roland will release the S7700  in the 
last quarter of  98 - a mega sampler/synth which combines the S7xx 
sampler series with the JV1xxx synth - expandable to 128 Mb RAM. 
I will certainly contact Roland to discuss its microtonal 
capabilities, particularly the ideas of (1) on-board absulute pitch 
meter (2) macro setup facilities for non-standard patches (3) the 
number of 'partials' (key-groups) etc.

Anyone else interested in knocking on their door with microtonal 
ideas?   

3) Akai will release the S6000 (?) at about the same time. Latest 
sampler, expandable to 256 Mb RAM.

Same question?

4) Lastly, I noticed that the Antares Auto-Tune (rackmount) is on its 
way, an updated hardware version of a feature of Pro-Tools.  I 
haven't seen or heard this thing - but here's the blurb. 

*******BEGIN SALES BLURB *********
......enjoy flawless pitch correction in real-time - without 
changing the signal in any other way........ Auto tune rack is simple 
to operate but extremely powerful in operation.  It comes complete 
with pre-set scales, incl. major, minor and chromatic (DUUHH!) in any 
key.  Want to make your own scales?  No problem, simply define any 
combination of notes as a custom scale......... if you don't want 
pitch correction to affect vibrato, slides, bends, etc you can simply 
set Auto-Tune to ignore them  
*******END SALES BLURB**********

I've no idea whether this thing is any good, or how the custom scales 
configuration works, but I can think of a number of applictions in 
which this kind of thing might be useful to tuning-ers.
