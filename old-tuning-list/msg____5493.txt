   I suspect that the majority of us listers don't really hate 12TET as
much as that we're excited by myriads of other possibilities.

   By the way, Ivor Darreg cited the same analogy to find the mood of
12TET, of the fish having to get out of the water before it can tell that
water even exists.  He used that analogy though, with respect to all other
tunings:  you can't fully appreciate any one without looking at them in
light of the others.
