   (John Chalmers pointed this one out to me;  thanks, John!)  Contrapuntally,
you could present this somewhat like you would suspended fourth.  That would be
kind of like suspending the fourth on elastic string!  In other words, the
fourth would go down a little bit to 9:7 above the tonic in the suspended chord,
rather than stick at 4:3 like in a true suspension, then finally resolve to 5:4.
I found it more effective, however, to not move the bass up a fourth from
scale-degree five to one until sounding the final tonic triad.  

   Neither of these two subtly different progressions seems to heighten the need
to resolve as much as does a 9:7 injected into the leading-tone rise path, as
suggested in the previous tip.  That's probably because the suspension gives the
sense that the authentic cadence has - conceptually speaking - already taken
place, even though we still have a note left over.  

   Here's another intriguing and somewhat similar possibility.  I won't dedicate
a tip to it because I haven't studied it enough to get a clear feel for its
usefulness.  Consider quartal harmony, or in particular, the three-note chord
formed by two 4:3s stacked atop one another.  The top note in that chord is a
16:9 minor seventh above the root.  It's certainly possible to move that chord
to a dominant seventh (with omitted fifth) by dropping the middle note from 4:3
above the root to 5:4 above the root.  That however is a rather weak harmonic
movement, probably because the harmonic tension doesn't really change all that
much.  

   But what if we make that movement through the 9:7?  The tension certainly
goes up.  One probably contrapuntally interesting way to do that would be to
have root and seventh first move up by 28:27 to where the 4:3 above the root
becomes 9:7, and then move that middle note down the remaining 36:35 to form the
5:4 against the moved root.
