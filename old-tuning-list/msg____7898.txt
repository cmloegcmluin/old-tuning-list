Subject: Re: Alternate Tunings for Brass Timbres?

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Sethares' work deals with finding scales appropriate for inharmonic
timbres. As recently discussed on the list, brass timbres are harmonic.
Therefore, the usual tunings discussed here, i.e., just intonation,
meantone temperaments, various equal temperaments that approximate just
intonation, etc., are your candidates for the alternative tunings best
suited for brass timbres. I do think brass ensembles tend to adjust the
tuning of their chords towards just intonation even more than string or
vocal ensembles, since the dissonance of out-of-tune intervals is
intensified by the brass instruments' loud partials.
