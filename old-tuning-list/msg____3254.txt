Subject: RE: Paul Erlich's points about inharmoni

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

So many objections, so little time. A few off-the-cuff comments:

I don't even know what that could mean, so it seems unlikely that I said it. 
What, exactly, is "my theory" on this subject? Can you quote something I 
said?

Many of Brian's supporting references do not support him at all. Terhardt's 
two components of consonance, I presume, are 1) critical band 
roughness/beating and 2) spectral fusion/virtual pitch formation. Brian's 
supporting references explain consonance and dissonance relations of 
inharmonic timbres in terms of the first component, but not the second. 
Brian then tries to interpret the existence of these consonance and 
dissonance relations as evidence that spectral fusion/virtual pitch 
formation is playing a role. Looks like bad logic to me. In particular, 
Parncutt's work rests firmly atop Terhardt's, far from being the final nail 
in Terhardt's coffin.

Brian says that only be putting the right inharmonic pitches together can 
you get a true "inharmonic series." Can you provide a reference that could 
lead to a definition or mathematical criterion for such a thing? Presumably 
it has to be based on iterated continued fractions or transcendental roots 
of transcendental numbers or a physical model, otherwise it just won't sound 
right?

Yes, there are cues other than pitch that can make partials "fuse" to some 
degree. And yes, the first component of consonance will exert an ordering 
influence on compositions using inharmonic timbres, and can be used as a 
principle to derive scales for these timbres. I don't think I ever said 
anything to contradict that. Then again, Brian has a way of reading whatever 
he wants into what people say, be it Gregory Taylor or Richard Parncutt. I 
sure hope his musical skills are better than his communicative skills!
