I'm not getting equivocal at all. The "simplified models", as Gary
observed, seem to handle the vast majority of cases. Dave Hill did find
specific values for the inharmonicities, which I would ascribe to
methodological errors, etc. But even if you don't believe me, and take
Dave's values for the inharmonicities, they are clearly of a different
order of magnitude (typically < 1 cent) than the departures of the
series of resonant frequencies from a harmonic series (typically dozens
of cents). That's what I've been trying to say.

>Any noise in the input will cause peaks at the resonant modes.

They are not really "peaks" so much as "hills" since there are no
constructively interfering standing waves to sharpen them. While the
noise energy will be spread throughout the spectrum, the energy from the
driver (reed, lips, bow) will manifest in Dirac-delta-function-like
peaks at harmonic overtones in the spectrum.

Listen, Gary and I have been defining systematic inharmonicity as cases
where, after the noise is removed, the partials deviate from a harmonic
series. Since noise doesn't exhibit interference effects, the only
inharmonicity relevant to JI is systematic inharmonicity.

Good point. I don't know about the rest, but you said it isn't
important, so . . .

Yes indeed!

The standard fingerings take this into account, in case you didn't know
that already. So, if knowing the standard fingerings is considered part
of "skill", then you are right.

While most physical nonlinearities are characterized by a quadratic
fixed point, this appears to be one with a zero-slope cubic nonlinearity
(inflection point). Instead of a period-doubling cascade, changes in the
parameter value for this type of system lead to a Fibonacci sequence of
period lengths. So changing the parameter in this case could decrease
the period to 2 or increase it to 5. I don't see how this is more
"stable" that a typical order 1/n^2 subharmonic for a
quadratic-fixed-point nonlinearity.

I don't know, but this would be at a higher processing level than the
neurons forming the auditory nerve, which is what is typically probed.
In any case, Gary was asking for a mechanism by which powers of two
would be distinguished from powers of any other number. Chaos theory
presents a very clear reason to think that such distinctions are often
made in nature.

What are "such high frequencies"? I did say "not too high" above!

The actual frequency at which periodicity pitch gives up is about 5-6
kHz. Really high!

Are white rats musically literate?

Many other cultures use octave-based notation.

Not unlikely at all! Look again at a bifurcation diagram -- there is
quite a large range of values where the period-2 behavior has a
relatively constant amplitude, but at one end of this range the
amplitude suddenly decreases and period-1 behavior ensues. If the
bassoonist is trying to keep within this range, say because he is trying
to play as loud as he can and octave subharmonics don't bother him but
chaos does, the parameter will likely take on just such a range of
values.

These don't sound like examples of real-world dynamics.

Not unlikely at all, I've done it with my vocal cords.

Actually, a differential equation needs to have at least 3 parameters
for chaos to occur. However, the picture along whichever of the
parameters is responsible for chaos will be the good old bifurcation
diagram. The Mandelbrot set represents a discrete (not continuous)
dynamical system, which only needs one parameter to exhibit chaos. If
you restrict yourself to the real line, you see the usual bifurcation
diagram again (proceeding from right to left). 

>I think there
>might even be a period 3, 9, 27, ... cascade in the Mandelbrot set.

Naah, the Mandelbrot set is clearly all about period doubling; the
iteration of a point on the set's boundary doubles the angle the point
makes on the unit circle (to which the boundary can be conformally
mapped). Although you could probably find some contorted path in the
complex plane to support your guess.
