Subject: Re: Invitation to Lurkers to Contribute

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

This is an open invitation for all those lurkers out there to step 
forward and introduce yourself.  I hope - and expect - that there will be 
tolerance and understanding by the regulars.  

While there have been attempts to generalize the makeup of the list, I 
suspect they reflect more about the writers, than the list itself.  
(perhaps myself included)

Biting off people's heads (figuratively) is easy to do on the internet, 
however, it can be resisted.  Intimidated by numbers?  Simply 
wait for a good opening when confidence has been raised.  If you are 
connected to this list then I am certain you have something important - 
and vital - to add to the discussions.  

The alternative is to allow for misrepresentation of the "group" and to 
overemphasize the regular contributors.

As has been pointed out, we are not all of like mind, but we do share 
interests, and we all have questions.  (Gee, sounds like trying to 
encourage voting in a democracy.)

Please, introduce yourselves.  It's a lot easier after the first post.
