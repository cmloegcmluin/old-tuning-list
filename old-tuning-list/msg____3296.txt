I tried mapping the Bohlen-Pierce scale, where a minor ninth on the keyboard 
becomes a perfect twelfth (and 2 cents) acoustically. It took many attempts 
on different parts of the keyboard before I could get a "forwards" 
interpolation, and then extrapolate.

768 tones/octave is good enough for my purposes. I tried a circulating 
temperament, where the circle of fifths was nominally adjusted by -3, -2, 
 -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2 cents. F# was the most dissonant major 
chord, as expected, but B-flat, rather than C, was the most consonant. I 
don't think there would be much of an audible difference for music that goes 
by at a reasonable pace, so I'm not going to complain. But if there is a 
systematic way of getting better results, I'd like to know about it.
