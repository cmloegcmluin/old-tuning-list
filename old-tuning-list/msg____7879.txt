Many thanks for your detailed reply Dave.

As I say, I don't have the background to have a serious view on the 
methodology therein, but I expect it could be stimulating.

I guess this would indeed be of much interest (if not directly to me, 
at least to prospective co-researchers) in the long term.  But maybe 
you should get in touch with Judy Brown - she's got a couple of Web 
pages which look like your current research:

and hers have quite a bit in common.

However, I assume from your post that the research you mentioned in 
_not_  published.  Did I understand correctly?  

One of the reasons I was asking about publication was because it 
seemed to me your results were quite specific and detailed in ways 
that are not obvious to read in Brown's article.  And that makes it 
much easier to understand for someone like me!  

cheers,
