Subject: JI Calc 4.21

From: Carter Scholz <csz@well.com>

To address a couple of recent messages about JI Calc:

-- The Stanford CA address Allen Strange gives for Robert Rich may
still work, but a more recent address is:
Soundscape Productions, 1071 Main Street #1, Cambria CA 93428.

-- There is a report (from Henry Rosenthal) that JIC's Mac local sound
doesn't work on recent Macs (System 7.5/ PowerMacs).  This is probably
due to Apple finally using the Sound Manager properly for audio
calls.  JI Calc writes directly to hardware that is probably absent
in newer Macs.  There are no plans to fix this, I regret to say.

-- Some minor bug fixes have been newly incorporated into version 4.21.

Thanks to Steve Curtin for spotting the problems.
