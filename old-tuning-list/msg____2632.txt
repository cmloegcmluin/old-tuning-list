Subject: Partch instruments on display in NYC

From: xen@tiac.net (J. Pusey)

For you folks in the greater New York City area: Yesterday I was doing some
research at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln
Center when I stumbled across an exhibition of homemade instruments in an
obscure second floor gallery.  Among the instruments on display are two by
Harry Partch: Eucal Blossom and Quadrangularis Reversum. The instruments are
kept behind glass (so you can't touch them), nevertheless you can still get a
very close view of them.  I have heard the Partch instruments in concert only
once (with a marred sound system), but this was my first opportunity to see any
of them up close and personal.  This exhibition is entitled "Metal Earth Wood
Styrofoam = Music" and runs until May 4.  It's free and open to the public
during normal library hours.

My understanding is that the rest of the Partch instruments are now residing at
Purchase College (part of SUNY) in Westchester County (New York) under the care
of Dean Drummond.  Does anyone know if they accessible to the general public
for viewing?

Speaking of Dean Drummond, in the brochure for the aforementioned exhibition,
there is mention of a third Newband CD containing a new recording of Partch's
"Castor and Pollux." Does anyone know if this CD has been released yet?
