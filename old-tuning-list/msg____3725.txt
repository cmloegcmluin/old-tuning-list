Subject: Response to Daniel Wolf

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Daniel,
Let's try to wind this up.

Okay, well that is different from my experience, and seems different from 
any documented psychoacoustic phenomena. But that doesn't mean you're wrong. 
How well does this extend up to, say, 11-limit hexads? I've found that 
tuning an 11-limit otonal hexad is easy, even with sine waves, while tuning 
an 11-limit utonal hexad, without listening to smaller subsets while tuning, 
is nearly impossible, unless the tones are unusually rich in harmonic 
partials.

Well, the effect is apparantly specialized enough that most music retains 
its character, since the BBE hardware works by reducing peaks through 
judicious frequency-dependent phase-shifts. This is what I thought you were 
talking about, the relative phases of two different partials in a harmonic 
relationship.

By a theory of composition I meant a method of analyzing compositions, just 
as a theory of physics does not cause physical phenomena to occur but merely 
explains them.

>(4) I believe your procedure is closely tied to western musical materials

Yikes. I don't see where you're getting this, and I should also point out 
that a pitch complex of two members is enough.

Look, I'm only trying to explain certain features of the musical experience 
here, namely phenomena that are due to what is going on at a given instant 
in time. Whether a certain chord is a tension or a relaxation will obviously 
depend on what goes on *before* and *after*, but there is a component that 
depends on the *during*, and one of the two components of that is related to 
the virtual pitch detection process. I feel it is very important to model 
and understand this process, becuase it is so strong as to convert all 
near-simultaneous near-harmonic sine-wave complexes into single sensations. 
To assume it has no impact on the musical effect of harmony would be folly.

>(5) For the Boomsliter and Creel example, I should have said harmonic

Ah, well in that case I would agree. (You meant 225/128, since 224/128=7/4.) 
Certainly one can follow a relatively long chain of 3/2 relationships, a 
relatively short chain of 5/4 or 6/5 relationships, and perhaps only one 7/4 
relationship (or not even) in the roots of consecutive chords. This is very 
different from the perception of simultaneities.
