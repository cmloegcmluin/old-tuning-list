" Each chemical
element is uniquely identifiable in the electromagnetic specturm by its
special set of unique frequencies.  These frequency sets interact to
produce
more
complexly unique cycle frequencies, which are unheard by human ear
but which resonate just as do humanly hearable musical chords or
dissonances."

   Interesting...  It would be curious to hear the chords produced by the
absorption patterns of various chemical elements and compounds, after
transposing them down some enormous number of octaves.  

   Were I to guess though, it would be little more than a curiosity.  I
personally doubt if they would have any particularly significant meaning to
our ears.  The two physical/physiological mechanisms are far too unrelated
for there to be much correlation.
