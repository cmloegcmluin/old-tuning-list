These are good questions.  In the electronic domain, I abandoned any
semblance to ET many years ago.  I fail to see the need nor use if it,
whether 12, 19, or more divisions to the octave.  Using direct digital soft-
ware synthesis, I by-pass the entire keyboard-driven paradigm and work
freely (and delightfully) in open frequency space guided only by various
projections of just intonation.

However, I still use ancient 12-ET when writing for piano, winds, etc., in
order to get music performed by the majority of musicians.  I am either not
willing or simply don't have the strength that Ben Johnston does to demand
that all performs learn JI to perform my music.  Within the ET paradigm,
I employ pitch bends (etc.) to approximate the intervals I'm after, but
I don't think it's realistic to expect live performers to be absolutely
accurate, when such precision is physically impossible anyway in performance.

Nonetheless, your question regarding the focus of our on-line discussions
is well placed.  We should discuss non-ET issues more, since they are more
interesting (IMHO).
