Subject: Microtonal keyboards

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

At the Huygens-Fokker concerts of last month were several generalised
keyboard designs at display and the designers were handing out
leaflets about them to gauge the public interest. 
Unfortunately I was not at the last concert and didn't get a chance to
talk to one of them. I don't know if there are serious plans to get
one in production or that they were just seeing how much response
there would be. The designers are 

Siemen Terpstra
Nigtevechtseweg t/o 35A
3633 XV  Vreeland

Gert Vos
Nw Prinsengracht 98 IV
1018 VW  Amsterdam

Gjalt J. Wijmenga
Postbus 30
3633 ZT  Vreeland

If you want to be kept up to date about any developments of
multifunctional keyboards you can send your name and address to Gjalt.
And mention if you are interested in buying one if production should
become possible. They were also asking for which design people would
prefer, but I can't show them by way of a 3D holographic image in an
e-mail alas (yet). They must have spent weeks glueing little pieces of
cardboard together and the results looked pretty ingenious. All keys
have the same size by the way, and are hexagonal or rectangular.
