Subject: JI Puns

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I made some more in-depth comments on punning earlier on the list, but I
cannot let PAULEs comments go uncorrected.

While temperaments can create ''stable'' puns by way of a kind of
portmanteau construction (e.g. the interval 4 in 12tet can be read as a pun
on 5/4 and 81/64), just intonations create puns by changing rational
interpretations in time. For example, a given tone can be approached as the
5/4 third of one chord and departed as the subharmonic septimal seventh of
another. This kind of pivot-tone modulation functions in both tempered and
just environments to similar effect, but under different constraints. The
just environment may require altering the tonal reference points (e.g.
slipping commas), while each temperament favors particular sets of puns.
