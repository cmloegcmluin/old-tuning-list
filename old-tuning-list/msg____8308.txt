   Well, that's a tricky question, because (unless you're talking about
beat frequencies) Hertz is a unit of absolute pitch (or frequency to be
more accurate), and cents are a unit of pitch change.  So that's a little
bit like asking "what's the conversion formula between miles and the North
Pole".  The North Pole defines a particular place (like a frequency in Hz),
where as a mile defines a distance between two places (like a number of
cents between two pitches).

   But perhaps this is what you're looking for:  Given two frequencies, f1
and f2, you can find the number of cents interval between them by the
formula:

                   n = 1200 * log (f1/f2) / log (2)
