It comes from Partch himself, who had two uses for the word limit. The
9-limit means a musical style where ratios of odd numbers less than or
equal to 9 function as consonances.

We're talking about 9:8 and 10:9 as harmonic simulaneities. Normally a
major second is considered dissonant.

I had no idea that the standard pedal steel guitar had pedals that
lowered pitches by a comma.
