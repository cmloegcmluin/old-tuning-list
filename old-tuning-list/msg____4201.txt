Subject: New site on microtonality

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

New site on Microtonality at http://www.teaser.fr/~daschour *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*
For the moment it's only in french, but in few weeks it will be also in
english and spanish. 
This is the home page of my brand new association called DEDALUS. One of his
major purpose is to promote microtonality by concerts.
I have still a lot of place to host some micro-thing.
My plans (for the page) include an online revue, presenting the differents
aspects of microtonality, portraits of composers, players, with a main theme
every six months. Examples of themes in a close future : notation, instruments.
The enterprise will tend to be exhaustive in a work-in-progress way to
constitute a international found on the subjects. All propositions, ideas
are welcome...
The big openning is planned for the first january of 1997.
Didier Aschour
