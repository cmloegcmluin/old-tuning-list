Why not have an album with half 12 ET tunes and the other half non12ET and you
could call it:  The Battle of the Microtones, or the Battle of the Critical
Bands... Here's the Pitch...  Tune in to a Mega Multidimensional Sound War. ET
squares off against a heavily primed Diamond Dave just in from California.  ET
beats a lot of opponents with alarming frequency, but the Diamond can be just
as rough. ET may even get the cents knocked out of him...    First in a
Harmonic Series of Battles.
