Subject: Re: TUNING digest 641 - Mode & Mood

From: "Laurence W. Key" <flute001@peabody.jhu.edu>

Dear Matthew et al.,

Two audible effects which may relate mode to mood, one local, the other 
global:

Proportionally beating triads.  These have a characteristic "ringing" sound.

The key coloration that results from irregular interval sizes.  In the 
so-called "well-temperaments", the C major triad is closest to just, 
and travel around the circle of fifths, either toward the dominant or the 
subdominant, yields triads which are progressively farther from just.

Since we are no longer limited to the keyboard's 12 pitches/octave, we 
don't get to hear the sound of the wolf diminished sixth in 1/4 syntonic 
comma meantone.  It's been disected into 31 equal parts in 31-ET.  The 
same can be said for the wolf diminished fourth (7:9) or augmented 
fifth.

One question that the musicologists haven't answered to my satisfaction:

Did composers avoid these sounds, i.e. did performers tune their keyboards 
to the pieces they were performing, or did they simply regard them as 
somewhat different-sounding intervals to be utilized/exploited/dealt with? 

                              Laurence W. Key
