Subject: Re: Neutral Third

From: Nangaku@aol.com

One special characteristic of the neutral third is that no matter what
kind of 5th there is in a system, the neutral third is always in the same
place logarithmically.  

Can you explain what it means to be in the same place logarithmically?  Also,
I noticed in Helmhotz that there are several intervals that may pass for a
neutral third including - the 39/32 at 342 cents, the 72/59 interval at 345
cents, and Zalzal's middle finger for 303 and 408 cents which is 27/22 at 355
cents. I assume 11/9 is around 347 cents.  Can we make any particular
distinctions about these different ratios or is it basically a matter of
context?
