Subject: various comments

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

First, Erlich mentioned, quite rightly, that I am subject to the same 
criticisms that I give to everyone else. No problem there; I have always 
felt criticism is a useful tool to progress as artists, and I have had my 
share. I come from a very hard school of learning; my teachers did not 
believe in being polite, but they were fair. When I began studying 
jazz/theory in 1976, I recall a gig I did where both of my teachers came 
to the job, sat there for several hours, and took a whole page of notes 
on my playing...I was petrified, and embarrassed, because I knew they 
were going to let me have it the next day, and they did. Not one of the 
notes was favorable; the whole page involved things I was doing wrong, 
and was expected to improve on...so, I worked very hard to get better, 
and I did. I saw my teacher, George Keith, play one of the most 
astonishing solos once (alto sax) on a jam session...I will never forget 
it, because it was flabbergasting, and he is a real undiscovered genius.
He was a very difficult teacher, but he expected the best from you. He 
told me a story once of jamming with a well known bop player, and getting 
cut so bad that he went home crying. He said he went back, every time the 
guy came to town, and it took him 9 years before he could hang with him; 
but he did it. So, criticism, to me, is fine...I draw the line at 
personal attacks, because it is NOT a personal issue. My allegiance is to 
the art of music, and nothing more.
    Also, my CD has been out for several years now, and I knew full well, 
as I sent it around the world for reviews, that it was/is fair game for 
any and all comments...for the most part, it's done OK, but a few critics 
really slammed it (and some of them did get personal, which is 
unexcuseable). Well, boo hoo for me...I survived, and learned some things 
as well. When I criticize, it is never meant to hurt on a personal level; 
but, we're humans with feelings, so feelings do get involved. If one 
is critical out of a desire to get the best possible out of someone, 
that's OK by me. If one is critical out of spite, jealousy, or anger, 
it's nonsense, and has no place anywhere, in my opinion. My feelings 
about poor microtonal music are genuine and heartfelt. I want to hear 
great music, and I especially feel that in the field of microtonality, we 
need all the great music we can get. So, if my criticisms are not 
appreciated, that is not surprising. All I can say is, I am much harder 
on myself that I will ever be with anyone else; I will also be as honest 
as possible.
    As far as Will Grant's comments about where are we going, I can say 
that I want to produce music that speaks from deep and profound places, 
and that will last the years. That's not so easy to do, and I have no 
idea if I will achieve that goal. I do know, again, that it takes a lot 
of very hard work, practice, and some sort of intuitive knowledge about 
which way to achieve said goal. I feel blessed that I have no problem 
with seeing the path I want to follow. Will said that someone told him to 
"be yourself"...that's the only advice I could give, either. If one does 
not know what that means, it's time to find out where the barriers are 
inside, and try to integrate them. And, it is extremely difficult, and I 
feel for anyone who walks that path.
    In closing, I remember my teacher George telling me, over and over, 
to analyze Bach, as well as Charley Parker...I have done so, and also 
analyze any and all music I encounter, to see what makes it tick. By 
doing this for 21 years, I have received many valuable insights about the 
structure of music, and the art of composition. We are always our own 
teachers, and the art of analyzation is the greatest tool I know for 
learning...also very difficult. I have found, as a teacher, that most 
folks want the answers handed to them...well, that makes one weak and 
unoriginal. By doing it the hard way, we learn to take control of our own 
artistic destiny..that is, and will continue to be, my path...Hstick
