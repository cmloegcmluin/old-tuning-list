Subject: Re: Brian's psychoacoustics

From: Bill Alves <alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu>

My goodness, judging from Brian's post, I'm ignorant and yet know enough to
have a nefarious "hidden agenda" to twist the facts to serve my own
proselytization for just intonation. Among the things I am supposed to have
claimed or implied are: that the ear is a machine that performs fourier
analysis (that different parts of the basilar membrane are responsive to
different frequencies in no way implies that it performs a fourier
transform), and that "higher brain regions" are involved in pitch
determination (though the neural pathways and brain are no doubt involved, I
cannot say how "high").

When I decide to compose with just intonation, I do so only because that is
what I like to hear, not because of any current research or intellectual
number-crunching (though I do not dispute the importance of the
research). Now, maybe my ears are fooling me, as Brian seems to suggest, but
I prefer to trust my ears rather than abstract reasoning when composing, if
it comes down to that. At any rate, I have grown to have a healthy
skepticism about acoustics research that purports to show that something
cannot be heard or is not musically significant based on contrived A/B blind
tests. Among the other things that have been "proven" this way is that
difference tones have no musical significance.

Oh, and Brian, I'm happy to see that you have come out against unproductive
flames. Does that include bigoted remarks about musicians in academia?
