If 11-limit just intervals are acceptable, how about 14/11 at 417.51
cents?

HF: I'm not thinking in terms of limits as usually used on this list.
Instead, some time ago, I asked myself, "Which ratios correspond closest
to PERCEPTUALLY DISTINCT qualities?" (in a harmonic context based on
existing Western tonal practice)

I listened to a large number of ratios one after another, alone and in
chords (using harmonic timbres), and concluded that for root position
3-6 tone tertian harmony, the intervals I listed, including the 3rds
above, provide the necessary model for an extension of tonal practice. 

We can label these qualities according to accepted terms:

7/6 subminor 3rd
6/5 minor 3rd
11/9 neutral 3rd
5/4 major 3rd
9/7 supermajor 3rd

In this view, 14/11 will be heard either as a supermajor or major third,
so it's not a perceptually distinct quality.

It's also true that one must create certain musical contexts to enable
the listener to distinguish certain of these thirds from others--for
example, it's easy to make a neutral third have the quality of 'major'
if it isn't surrounded by a pair from the remaining 3rds, built from one
of the 'minors' and one of the 'majors'.  


>7/5, 3/2 (fifths)

Is there some reason you prefer 7/5 over 10/7?

HF: 7/5 is the first 'diminished fifth' quality in the harmonic series,
and is found in the 5:6:7 diminished triad.

As mentioned already, these ratios can be used to model aspects of
voice-leading in JI as well as various ETs--thus, I'm not tied to one
system, but do have a consistent model for voice-leading across them.

The best way to make sense of all this is to try it out yourself. For
example, recreate this V-I four-part harmony cadential pattern (ratios
built on the same tone until the final chord):

8 18 7   10
6 15 6   8 
5 12 5   8
4 10 4   4
------   --
V        I (obviously a 3/2 distance between V and I)

Happy listening. 

If you live in southern CA, contact me now if you'd like to try and meet
(if you haven't already).
