From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

SY-77 ,16-part multi-timbral. 16-voices of polyphony for the FM 
section.Another 16-voices 
for the AWM (sample playback) section. If you build voices that 
incorporate both , you'll
just have to think of it as 16-voice.

BTW,here's some more on the VL70-m.In addition to the WX-11 jack,it has a 
built-in
16-channel computer  interface (Mac & Wintel). Also ,you can program six 
completely custom
physical modelling sounds -- you need the Mac-based Expert Editor or the 
Visual Editor (Mac or Windows) )available free for download from the 
website)to send the sounds  to the VL70-m via MIDI port or serial port.
