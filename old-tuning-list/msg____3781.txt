Subject: WTC

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

When I suggested that no extreme tunings would work on WTC under normal 
assumptions, yes, I meant things like 1/4-comma meantone. I appreciate 
the comments on the tunings given by Ed Foote. I wonder if he'd comment 
on Werckmeister III for Book 2, or make other observations on this 
subject generally. (I agree that Werckmeister III on a piano is not 
something I'd like to contemplate except as an experiment, unrelated to 
this repertory.)

Again, anyone know which tunings are used by Tilney, Leonhardt, or Gilbert 
in their recordings of WTC I and II (I know the title applies only to 
Book 1).
