Subject: circumference / diameter = 3

From: "Jeude, James" <JeudeJ@mail.dnb.com>

Yes, this posting is a hoax.  Also a hoax is the rumour that Indiana at
one time attempted to legislate the same thing.

And yes, the Chronicles (and book of Kings) do refer to the 30 cubits
around and 10 cubits across.  Please note, though, if the item were
hexagonal, the diameter would be exactly 3.0000...this is perhaps the
rendering anticipated.  Also, the lip had a finite width -- perhaps the
30 cubits was the interior circumference and 10 cubits was the exterior
diameter, making the lip 0.7 cubits thick.  More likely, I think the
scribes could neither measure nor write a phrase requiring fractional
cubits.

If only the musical instruments of the time were described in detail by
the authors!  I would love to know the structure and tunings.
