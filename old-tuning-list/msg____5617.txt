Subject: Book suggestion: resonators

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

When I posed the question about cavity resonators some time ago, I
completely forgot this book, which someone on the GAMELAN list cited:

Harry F. Olson _Music, Physics and Engineering_ (formerly titled _MusicalEngineering_), second edition, Dover 1967.

The chapter on _Resonators and Radiators_ (pp. 59-107)  has a detailed
description of Helmholz resonators with the best formulation I've yet
found. However, for my purposes, I am convinced that trial and error, when
possible copying existing models, is the best practical means of designing
such resonators. Of course, someone with better programming skills might
give it a try...
