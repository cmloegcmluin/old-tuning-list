Subject: Alternate Tunings for Brass Timbres?

From: "Just Intonation" <justintonation@hotmail.com>

I discovered an old John Chalmers post yesterday on a web site in 
Finland:

   http://www.tut.fi/~vnummela/mclaren

   ...that contained Brian McLarens thoughts on what's hot and what's 
not in the 90s in terms of music theory and composition. He mentioned 
the work of William A. Sethares, who now has a book/CD out (Tuning 
Timbre Spectrum Scale):

   
   http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html

   ...about creating timbre-specific tuning scales.

   I was curious if anybody on the list knew of any one exploring these 
avenues in general, and, specifically, if there is anybody in the 
alternative tuning scene who is composing for acoustic or synth brass 
timbres (which are my favorites), and what your opinions are regarding 
which alternative tuning scale is best suited for composing with brass 
timbres. Thanks.
