Subject: concert in Frankfurt

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

A short report on a concert (Friday, 20 Dec. 1996) by the
Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt in the broadcast hall of Hessischer
Rundfunk.

The program had works by Claude Vivier (Orion(79)), Walter Zimmermann
(Suave mari magno, part I (96)) and Klarenz Barlow (Orchideae Ordinariae or
The Twelfth Root of Truth (89)).

Although the Vivier work included some arresting natural harmonics in an
otherwise odd mixture of Messiaen unisons, Hovhaness-esque orientalisms and
some Stockhausen effects, the Zimmermann and Barlow works are of more
interest to the tuning community.

Zimmermann uses pitches from Aristoxenus´gamut (including quarter-tone, and
in the Aristoxenian spirit, the exact intonation is undefined, but the
extremely musical performance under Peter Rundel tended towards the 24tet
values) and like Schumann's  _sphinx_s , he has transribed a Greek text
(Epicurus) letter by letter using the Greek instrumental and vocal
notations. The nine-minute work has, however, a largely harmonic texture,
in which the individual modes are assigned to each of six small orchestras
distributed around the stage. Rhythmic coordination ranges from all six
ensembles together, groups or single ensembles coordinated, and
uncoordinated solo playing.  

Barlow's work is not microtonal per se, but it does seem to be a very
effective translation of the harmonicity and tonality functions used in his
Autobus piece into a very large orchestral work. It is essentially a four
movement symphony - with cross fades between movements, acoustical grafitti
c/o Bruckner and Stravinsky, and an extraordinary piano cadenza that sends
the work out in the grand style (with a slight nod to Frank Sinatra:
Barlow, saying to the whole symphonic tradition: I did it my way!)

Barlow has published an extended analysis of the work in the Feedback
Papers (Cologne).
