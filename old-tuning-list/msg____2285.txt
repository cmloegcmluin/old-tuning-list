	This seems to show the "intentional fallacy": the idea that art can
only be enjoyed by apprehending it or understanding it in the way that the
artist intended.  Hearing the piece on a 12-TET piano must have driven your
ears crazy though!

	I believe that most composers who work in Just Intonation use more
than twelve tones per octave.  Using only twelve precludes a large difference
in the complexity of the ratios involved; the difference between dissonance
and consonance is reduced.  Using more than twelve allows you the same
relative levels of dissonance and consonance as are found in 12-TET.
	You didn't mention what sort of people you played the
synthesizer tape for.  If they were people who had heard the piano
performance, then naturally the JI version would sound odd to them.
