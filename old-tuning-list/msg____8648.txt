From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I think the main problem of a organization is that we have moved into a
"polytheists" attitude in regard to tuning. There is no single point
outside of using pitch in different ways that holds us all together.
This list is enough and this list is the one thing we can all agree on.
I hate to say that 70% of the other suggestions raised the hair on my
back. I feel others felt the same. REJOICE IN THE LIST!!!!!!
