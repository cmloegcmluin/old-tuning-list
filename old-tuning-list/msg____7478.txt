Subject: [Jonni Super:  Musical instrument question, SAZ & OUD]

From:     J P Fitch <jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk>

I Saw this posed to a moderated group for which it is not appropriate.
Then I thought someone here might know and answer this lost soul.

I know this may not be the right place to ask, but I'll go for it
anyway.  If you're wondering why I'm posting here, it's because I have
no idea where else to post.  

So....

Can anyone in cyber-space tell me how to tune a Turkish SAZ and OUD?
(Musical instruments, incase you were wondering)  ie: is it tuned in
4ths or 5ths?

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, just skip this.

Thanks in advance.  Just write me, please, or at least point me in the
right direction.
