I noted that Brian said...
  Many of the subscribers to this forum have done non-12 Csound
  compositions, but they're reluctant to give out scores for
  copyright reasons.  I myself requested a number of subscribers
  to post Csound scores of their microtonal computer music
  compositions.
  Every single composer demurred, citing copyright concerns.

It is possible that i do not count as a composer, but I am completely
willing to post my only complete work in non-12ET as a csound orc/sco,
and am not concerned about copyright -- I do not expect to make money
on it anyway.  Indeed after its premier this August I will place it on
the web.  Thinking about it, the other complete csound work only has
one note so I am not sure of its scale....
