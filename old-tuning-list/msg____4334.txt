Subject: Genesis of a Music question

From: malkin@iwaynet.net (David Malkin)

I am confused with Harry Partch's description of the 5 limit in Chapter 7
of "Genesis of a Music." What is a 5 limit (or any "n" limit for that
matter)? Is it a scale that only includes ratios with a 5 in numerator or
denominator? Is the highest prime 5 that any number in numerator or
denominator can be divided into?
He uses a scale as follows: 1/1   6/5   5/4   4/3   3/2   8/5   5/3   2/1
on page 109.
        What about 16/15. This ratio's numerator and denominator are
divisible by primes that are 5 or less. Does he choose his scale based on
what sounded good, on how close to just he could get?
        On page 110 he speaks of the coexistence of Major and Minor and
draws the first Tonality diamond in the book. Why do these major and minor
sounds (ie Otonalites and Utonalities) result. It seems like they just
appear out of thin air.
        What is a Numerary Nexus? His definition on page 72 is confusing to me.
        Sorry to bother you with these questions, but who else in the world
is there to turn to? Your standard music prof at "state" university?
I would appreciate any help you can give me.
