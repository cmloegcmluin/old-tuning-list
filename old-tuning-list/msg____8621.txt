Subject: co-op...

From: "Robin Perry" <jinto83@hotmail.com>

I'd like to present a concept to you:

It has occured to me that we (theorists/inventors/musicians/composers)
might benefit by forming a corporation (possibly non-profit)to promote
our work in microtonality/just intonation.  

As I see it, this entity could have several functions - publishing,
education, copyrighting, patent ownership/protection, advertising and
promotion, product distribution....

I know I'm not the only one who works on his music by the light of the
moon (the only time I have left at the end of my work day).  I have a
passion for this 
revolution-that-may-never-happen-unless-there-is-passion-in-it in music 
and I am very excited to be a part of it all. 

Cohesive effort, combined with enthusiasm, will get attention and will
create change in the musical landscape.  The time is right with the
turn of the millenium for that future that's been peeping over the 
horizon to become the present.

Whatchathink?

Robin
