Subject: Sound-from-Scratch Microtunable Synth Recommendation?

   Actually, when I sent out this question, I wanted to check John
Loffink's web page first, but had some sort of network problem that made me
unable to reach it.  It just now seems to have started working though -
just as abruptly as it stopped.  Hmmm...

   But anyway, now that I can get to his page, I think I see more answers
to my questions than I realized previously.  First of all, I had forgotten
about the column in his tables that describe the types of tone generation
(sampling, FM, etc.) it supports.

   I'd like to verify something though:  If I understand your definitions
correctly, John, "keyboard scales" mean completely arbitrary tunings
key-for-key (within the resolution and range of the instrument), right?  I
think I must have misread that definition the last time I looked at your
web page.)

   This is a great web site, by the way.

   In any case though, I'm definitely interested in you folks' personal
recommendations in particular (i.e., not only which synthesizers have that
ability).
