Reading this again, I note an even more important point: the ear does
_not_ detect energy at the beat frequency; even beat rates in the
audible range do not necessarily produce audible tones (they only can be
said to do so if the conditions are right for difference tones: loud
enough for the real nonlinearities of the ear to be inmportant), as
Helmholtz observed. The beat is only a variation in the energy at an
average frequency of the original waves.
