Subject: Page & Plant do Xen ? & Vai

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Just caught a bit of a new Jimmy Page/Robert plant song on MTV,as I was 
passing through the living room. Interesting tonalities and atleast to my 
inexperienced ears,veers off 12-TET.If anyone could make  interesting 
microtonal rock music AND get people to listen,it's these guys.
I think the album is called "Walking into Clarksdale".

About Steve Vai,he's never had a bigger fan than me ( I  owned a 
Universe.No,no, I'm not a crazed megalomaniac,I speak of the 7-string 
thing),but as I've gotten smarter (i.e. abandoned 12-TET for anything 
else) and from what few words he's been quoted on non-12-TET ,I keep 
wondering if he's just pulling our collective legs ? OR,perhaps some wise 
magazine editor people have been filling up the cutting floor ? (No 
offence to  David  Beardsley or 'zine people in general)

Paul  Erlich,I believe,said:
>I have two Ibanez 7-string guitars (which Steve Vai designed), one of which I

>how to get in touch with him!
It would be very interesting to get Vai to speak a bit about his 
experiences with microtonality.
Like Neil says,if someone of Vai's stature had to put out real microtonal 
music,it would make some waves.Besides,I have never come upon anyone with 
a higher level of skills with the electric guitar.

Later,
