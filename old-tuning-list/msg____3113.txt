Subject: Paul Erlich's insightful comments

Kudos to Paul Erlich.  Having seived through
hundreds of my posts and thousands of my posted
quotes, references, tables, numbers, equations
and citations, he has succeeded in finding
2 errors. (Actually one of 'em is not an
error, but a sly joke.)
The 1ere error in question involves my calling
phi a transcendental number.  As Paul astutely
points out, phi is the solution of a simple
algebraic equation with rational coefficients
and real rational exponents: x^2 - X - 1 = 0.  
This means that phi is by definition an
algebraic irrational, rather than a 
transcendental irrational number. 
Thanks, Paul.
As mentioned on many another occasion,
Your Humble E-Mail Correspondent is a 
mathematical idiot.  This means I make plenty
of flubs when it comes to math--like my infamous
statement that "i is the square root of -1."  
(Of course -i also qualifies, as Manuel Op de
Coul pointed out.)
This also means that I'll make plenty of mathematical
flubs in the future.
Thanks in advance to everyone who'll be on the lookout
for my math errors.  It's important, when speaking 
about mathematics, to catch the errors before they
propagate.
Here's Erlich's reaction to my little joke (which he
must have misunderstood as an error):

"It does not. However, [2^1.22222, 2^2.33333, 2^3.444444, 2^4.55555,
2^5.666666, 2^6.777777, 2^7.888888, 2^8.99999] is all the notes in the
9-tone equal tempered scale, and combination product sets of this will,
trivially, produce 9-tone equal tempered scales. Nothing bizarre about it.
Brian McLaren reminds me of a Ludwig Plutonium on some of the sci.
newsgroups, and Albert Silverman on rec.music.compose. Long,
self-aggrandizing posts filled with factually incorrect and useless 
examples and lots of whining about the establishment, accompanied by 
a complete lack of ability to communicate with the other members of 
the group." -- Paul Erlich, Tuning Digest 719


Let us re-examine EXACTLY what I said:

"According to Manuel Op de Coul's SCALA program, this
Wilson CPS produces the 9-tone equal-tempered scale." -- mclaren

My statement above is correct as it stands.  
There's a bug in Manuel's SCALA program version 1.0 which 
produces a fairly humorous result for the CPS function when
you input a Wilson 3,8 CPS with generators [1.22222, 2.33333, 
3.444444, 4.55555, 5.666666, 6.777777, 7.888888, 8.99999]
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that these
generators cannot possibly produce a 9-TET scale--or
so I assumed. 
It seemed so obvious to me that the result I gave was
comically wrong, that it would be immediately apparent
to any forum subscriber that I was poking a tiny bit of
fun at the beta version of Manuel's SCALA program.
The tip-off, of course, being the last sentence of my post--
a sentence which Erlich deliberately left off when 
he misrepresented my post:

"According to Manuel Op de Coul's SCALA program, this
Wilson CPS produces the 9-tone equal-tempered scale.
It is left as an exercise for the enterprising xenharmonist
to determine why and how.
--mclaren"

My expectation was that at least one "enterprising xenharmonist"
would actually feed my numbers into SCALA, discover that
SCALA gave an incorrect result, and report that fact in the
properly amused tone.
Instead, Erlich compares me to someone called "Ludwig Plutonium," 
whoever that is.
Let us re-read the last sentence of my post:

"It is left as as an exercise forthe enterprising xenharmonist
to determine why and how." -- mclaren

This is peculiar way of describing what should be a straightforward
scale-generation procedure.  Tongue in cheek, anyone?  The "why" 
is simple: there's a bug in SCALA 1.0.  The "how" is less simple--
it appears to involve an ADA routine which assumes that only
integers will be entered.
I did not expect anyone to penetrate that deeply into the arcana
of my sly little joke; and of course no one did.
Thus, when Erlich complains (Tuning Digest 719) about
"Long, self-aggrandizing posts filled with factually incorrect and 
useless examples..."   it is of some interest to examine his plaint.
Presumably Erlich wants people to believe that my posts are
"filled" with "factually incorrect" examples.
Yet out of my hundreds of posts and thousands of facts, Erlich
has been able to find only 2 errors--one of which wasn't even
an error.
Out of my thousands of facts and hundreds of posts, Erlich pounces
on 1 (one, count it--one) error.  (I incorrectly identified phi as
a trascendental irrational rather than an algebraic irrational.)
On the basis of this 1 (one, count it--one) error, Erlich
rants:
"Brian McLaren reminds me of a Ludwig Plutonium on some of the sci.
newsgroups..." 
Okay.
Now I think we've all got the picture.
Make 1 error out of  several hundred posts, and you're a charlatan.
One (count it, 1) error identified out of thousands of facts,
tables, quotes, citations...and *this* means that my posts are
"filled" with "factually incorrect" examples.
Need I say more?  
Does *anyone* out there require convincing that Paul Erlich
is less concerned with the facts than with ad hominem attacks
on Your Humble E-Mail Correspondent?
While we're on the subject of errors, turnabout is fair play.
So let's examine one of Paul Erlich's own posts,
and see whether it contains any "factually incorrect" examples...
Paul Erlich stated in Tuning Digest 718 that subharmonics are 
not   present in the spectra of  acoustic instruments.  
This is not only false, it demo
hates that Erlich has not done 
little (if any) Fourier analysis of real-world instrument sounds.
One of the hard facts is that book learning will  only take 
you so far when you apply DSP techniques to the study of
real sounds.  Then you've got to get your hands dirty out in
the real world and find out that 90% of what you
learned in those books applies only in special cases,
or doesn't apply at all.
Ralph David Hill has written a Fourier analysis/
resynthesis software system which is capable of
detecting, analyzing, and resynthesizing quasi-
harmonic sounds.
Yesterday I visited Dave at his home and he ran
me through a demo of his system.  He resynthesized
a trombone note with and without the octave-below and 
2-octaves below subharmonic.  The notes resynthesized
without both subharmonics sounded noticeably different
from the original sound, and significantly less
realistic.
Dave reported this at the 1982 ICMC, so it's very old news.
Clearly Paul Erlich needs to learn something about
signal processing, real-world timbres, and the
limitations of using off-the-shelf Fourier
analysis software.
