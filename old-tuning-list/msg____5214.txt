Subject: logic

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Brian Belet...logic is an extremely limited tool, although useful for 
certain things. I personally enjoy discussing all sorts of phenomenon, 
and have found the forum lately to be quite lively and interesting. 
People have been sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings about 
life, and there's nothing more significant than that. Music is perhaps 
the most "mystical" of arts, and to only discuss it in mathematical terms 
is extremely boring...the math is cool, but it ain't the same thing as 
DOING it. I wonder, as Morrison did a while back, how many folks on the 
forum are real musicians, and how many are theorists...

Just as Brian Belet would prefer to see an end to the "mystical" thread, 
I myself would like to see more on this forum about real music, as 
opposed to math and theories...although I do have the highest respect for 
the monsters of theory, to be sure, and have learned a lot from studying 
them. Music transcends any form of logic, and for that I am 
grateful...let the discussions continue...Hstick
