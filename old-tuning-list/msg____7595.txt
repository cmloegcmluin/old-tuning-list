I think 19 is much more admissible as a rational implication of the
sharp 9th than 11 or 13 are admissible as rational implications of
anything in 12tET (despite what Schoenberg may have had to say).

Let's analyze a few common jazz chords (which are normally played, of
course, in 12tET):

1. 13flat9 (meaning: root, maj .3rd, min. 7th, min. 9th, maj. 13th; the
perfect 5th is often omitted in jazz)

I think this chord derives its flavor from the major triad formed on the
maj.13th with the min. 9th and maj. 3rd.  This triad resonates clearly
and forms a polyharmonic structure against the root. Tuning the triad
27:34:40 would destroy this effect and render the chord pretty ugly
(IMO). Hence in this case the maj. 13th should be 5/3 and the min. 9th
should be 25/12.

2. sharp11flat9 (meaning: root, maj. 3rd, min. 7th, min. 9th, aug. 11th)

Here, there is a strongly resonating dominant seventh chord formed on
the aug. 11th with the min. 7th, min. 9th, and maj. 3rd. If we fix the
maj. 3rd at 5/4, then the aug. 11th should be 10/7, the min. 7th should
be 25/14, and the min. 9th should be 15/7. Of course, the fact that the
min. 7th is also close to 7/4 helps to reinforce the root along with the
maj. 3rd. It is very common in jazz to have a maj. 3rd - min. 7th
tritone imply two different roots, one with their traditional roles and
one with their roles reversed. This requires a tuning, such as 12tET,
where the 50:49 "septimal sixth-tone" vanishes.

3. 6/9 (meaning root, maj. 3rd, perf. 5th. maj. 6th, maj. 9th)

Here, we have a chain of 5ths, but also a major 3rd and two minor
thirds. If all these intervals are to be consonant, no just
interpretation will really do. This chord requires a tuning where the
80:81 syntonic comma vanishes.

Other examples can be pointed out, but I think that's enough to make my
point for now.

By the way, the simplest ET consistent in the 19-limit is 80tET.
