Subject: Johnny Reinahrd interview
--
A very recent issue of "20th Century Music"
contains a fascinating interview with Johnny
Reinhard about his labors in rescuing from
oblivion Charles Ives' "Universe Symphony." 
I must confess to having had my doubts about
the utility of sepdning a whole bunch of effort
on a fragmentary and icnomplete microtonal
composition by a dead guy instead of Johnny
spending time performing music by living 
microtonal composers.
However, it turns out that once Johnny go t
into the project he discovered that Ives'
"Universe Symphony" was largely complete!
So apparently it was simply the messy
distribution and almost indecipherable scrawl
of Ives' handwriting that deterred previous
researchers from assembling Ives' "Universe
Symphony" into a coherent whole.
However, Johnny Reinahrd has now apparently
managed this Herculean feat.
So it looks as though congratulations are due
all around.  A long-neglected masterwork by
a great American composer will soon be heard
in New York.
Good work, Johnny!
