Subject: HABA! (...now that I have your attention)

From: Stephen Soderberg <ssod@loc.gov>

Hello again everyone; I've really been enjoying this list since finding
it.  Today I have two questions and an advertisement.
	From me-the-librarian:
	I have a patron here who is interested in locating a microtone
piano to play Alois Haba & other stuff on.  I assume he's talking about
quartertone or sixthtone.  Does anyone out there know where these animals
are located, if they still exist at all?
	From me-the-music-lover:
	I took a look at the Denver microtone page recently.  Nice site!
But as I was running through the list of microtone "pioneers" I didn't
find Haba listed.  I'm curious about this and also that since I've been on
the list Haba's name hasn't come up even once that I remember.  Is it
because he used 24TET and 36TET so extensively, and these are now
considered "passe" or "unusable" relics of 12TET?  I really love his
string quartets and am wondering if there's an objective reason for his
seeming exclusion from the microtonal hall of fame?
	From me-the-theorist:
	On a related topic, if all goes well, I'll be having an article
published in Music Theory Online early next year entitled "White Note
Fantasy."  I'd rather wait until it's out to discuss online, but some
highlights are: a "WARP function" that transforms sonorities between ET
spaces of any size; the extension of the usual diatonic to hyperdiatonic
systems in 12nTET spaces (as it turns out, the only place you can get
micro-systems that give you *all* the transformation benefits of the usual
diatonic is in 12TET, 24TET, 36TET, etc.); in higher ET spaces, the
basic (hyperdiatonic) chords are no longer triads-- in 24 they're
pentachords, in 36 heptachords, etc.; some interesting voice leading
implications of moving diatonic materials into larger spaces.
	I'm not a particular advocate of hyperdiatonic systems or of ET or
JI or 19 or 22 or 144 or whatever, but I do find it hard to believe that
we won't all be listening to some *very* different stuff 100 years from
now (well, I won't, but...) --
