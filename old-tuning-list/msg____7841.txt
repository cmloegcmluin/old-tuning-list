This whole argument smacks of what I object to in the prime-limit
theoreticians' approach. Harmonically speaking, an interval is never
more likely to be interpreted as a higher-odd-limit, lower-prime-limit
ratio than a higher-prime-limit, lower odd-limit ratio, holding the
approximation error constant. I think the four 5-prime-limit ratios you
listed have very little to do with the way a tritone is heard
harmonically, even if tuned to exactly those ratios. Although I agree
that the Pythagorean tritones, despite their low prime limit, are very
dissonant, I don't think the JI tritones are "much" more consonant. In
fact, they may even be more dissonant, since the Pythagoean tritones
approximate simple 7-limit ratios better.

Anyway, I maintain that the fact that the tritones reinforced the root
of the dominant chord when combined with it harmonically helped to
define major and minor as the "tonal modes", while other modes without
such harmonic-melodic focus fell out of use.
