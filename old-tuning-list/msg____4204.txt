While Brian McLaren is going on about yakademics,
just remember that in tuning digest #256, (Fri Dec 16, 1994)
Brian wrote:

In fact there are an amazing number of exceptionally
capable composers and theorists in academia.  They 
generally take on protective coloration--they spout all 
the right buzz-words ("the New Complexity!" "The New 
Turgidity!!" "The New Pomposity!!!") but like effective 
chameleons they're merely hiding their true nature 
from the faculty committees and grants committees 
and awards committees.

              ... a long list of talented academics...

Yes, Virginia, there ARE talented composers in academia.

I am happy that Brian is willing to attack Cage,
and I am also happy that several list subscribers
are ready to defend... Cage was an influential composer
who published a lot, and he must stand or fall based on what 
he said, wrote, and composed. 

I am not so happy with attacks based on casual emails.
I do not believe that people need to stand behind
every word they write in email, any more than
they need to stand behind every casual comment
in a phone conversation. 

For instance, I would much rather discuss 
(or read a discussion of) Eric Lyons CD "Red Velvet" 
(which I do believe he should be held responsible for)
than read that he is a victim of junkthink
because in an email message he used the word
"experiment" incorrectly.
