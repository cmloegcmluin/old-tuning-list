Thanks for your "new and improved" cynicism Carl.;-)

Yes, LucyTuning is a meantone tuning; yet neither 1/3 comma, nor 1/4 comma.

The values are very specific and derived from pi.

The thing which is significant (instead of references to integer 
frequency ratios), is that LucyTuning at http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy is 
developed from a new 
paradigm for harmonic mapping, enabling users to transpose and modulate 
forever plus emulate any other tuning system.

To get to Steve's Mac program tantrum directly, go to
