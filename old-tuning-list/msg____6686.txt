Subject: 22-equal unsuited to the diatonic

You admit that the 22-tone equal cannot be used for diatonic music. I am
very glad that you do so, for this admission tends to prove you to be
reasonably objective.

I do not wish to be taken for someone anxious to _condemn_
investigations into tuning systems other than the 19-tone equal. The
22-tone equal, for example has interesting properties, and it is
intrinsically good that a person wishes to explore new, untried things.

Your statement that "22-tone equal may be the only salvation of music,
etc" I think incorrect, but it indicates an adventurous spirit willing
to make decisions.

One of my objectives is to find a single temperament that is very well
suited to diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic music. I believe that I
have found this in the 19-tone equal. Indeed - and this continues to
amaze even me, so I blame no one for being incredulous - I suspect it is
_uniquely_ well-suited to all three species of melody and harmony. I
will continue to try to explain why this is apparently so.
