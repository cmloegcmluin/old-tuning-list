This has been recommended to me before, but I've never picked it
up--largely because the title seems to narrow the scope of the topic
considerably.  But, today, I did go out and pick it up.  Fingers
crossed that it will provide some insight.

I've got this--should have mentioned so, earlier.  While this shows
the 145 and 168 interval (called, the Persian mujannab and Zalzal's
mujannab, respectively), I still don't have a clue on how you arrive
at these two intervals.

Does this cover the Islamic tunings as well?
