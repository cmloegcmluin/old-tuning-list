timbre tone quality, the way a note sounds (as determined by its partials) 
simple tone sine wave, also called pure tone, (a timbre with one partial)
complex tone a timbre with multiple partials
partials the simple-tone or sine-wave components of a timbre
harmonic partials partials whose frequencies relate in whole numbers
inharmonic partials partials whose frequencies do not relate in
                      whole numbers 
flageolet tone a sound you get when you lightly touch a string
                 while exciting it
ghosttones (same as flageolet tone)

Fretting positions say nothing about ghosttones. A 
fretted string is effectively an open string with shorter 
length. One can place frets at arbitrary positions and 
produce equally strong sounds. Please explain the 
sequence of ghosttones which occur in a series of fourths 
and fifths.

What are the frequencies of these ghosttones (rather
than the frequencies of the fretted tones at the same 
locations (which is what your charts show))?

When you say "at fret...B" do you mean only a single
fret or all the frets which produce B's?

I'm plucking my violin as I write this. I notice that 
the strongest ghosttone is the one I get when I touch
the string near the middle. Does your sequence include
this ghosttone?

Are you saying that there are no ghosttones at places
other than these fret positions?

Are you sure that the volumes of the ghosttones in your
series are in the same order as the series (in other
words that no ghosttone is louder than one earlier 
in the series)?

Are you saying that the volume of a ghosttone some
number of fretted-fifths along the series is as 
loud as the volume of a ghosttone the same number 
of fretted-fourths along the series (for instance 
ghosttone at fret for C# as loud as ghosttone at 
fret for F)?
