Subject: Re: Tibetan Tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

On May 14, 1988 at the MicroFest I Symposium at New York University, David
Rothenberg gave a presentation entitled Timbre as Scalar Material.

The gist I got out of this presentation was that the wide glissando-like
melodies used by Tibetans were not improvised at all, but fully composed.
The distinction here is that even the melodic shapes can be explicitly
composed and that scalar tones might seem as jumping stones across a
river.  According to David Rothenberg's theory, the Tibetans prefer to
wade through the river, avoiding the stones altogether.

David Rothenberg (tel. 212-662-8506) presented musical examples and
detailed his thesis, introduced above.  Other presenters were Jules
Siegel: Confessions of a Just Intonation Fascist; Henry Lowengard:
Computer Applications; and Timothy Hill: Hoomi Overtone Singing.  

There was a wonderful panel discussion entitled "On the Integrity of
Microtones in American Music" with Odetta, Deborah Blincoe, John Forrest,
Reggie Workman, and yours truly.
