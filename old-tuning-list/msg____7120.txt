From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I just received the latest issue of Bart Hopkin's journal,
Experimental Musical Instruments, and like every other issue,
it contains many interesting articles and notes. Two items which
may interest ATL readers are Greg Phillips's program for tuning
Windchimes to any set of pitches. This program is available for
downloading from ftp://ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/xen/chime/zip
and runs under Windows. A Soundblaster compatible card is recommended.

Warren Burt has a review of the latest Enclosure: 3 from Philip Blackburn.
This volume consists of largely unpublished writings and correspondence of
Harry Partch and is illustrated with photographs and HP's own sketches.

The issue also contains articles on Hungarian sound sculpture, Hohner
free reed instruments, Vare'se's Po'eme E'lectronique, Ellen Fullman's
Long Strings, and several types of new acoustic instruments.

Regrettably, Bart is terminating EMI in June of 1999, though he says
back issues, cassettes, CD's, books, etc. will continue to be available.
