Hello tuners, I'm responding regarding the request:

post an "ad" or notice to some WEB or internet site.

Musicworks Magazine has a web site where the regular advertisers get space
on their web page. As I work for MW my opinion is biassed, but I think it
would be a good place to advertise guitar fret/tuning systems - the mag as
well as the site. Frog Peak advertises there, so do a few other similar
organizations.

Thier web page is http://www.musicworks.web.net/sound.
