Oh, one other point I wanted to mention here:

   Marion's comment, if I recall correctly, cited my 88CET postings -
essentially - as an illustration of the volume of prerequisite study needed to
explore equal-temperaments.  That as opposed to his semi-automated techniques,
whereby he's produced what he estimated at 45 hours of music in 145 just
tunings.  

   I certainly don't claim to be an expert on Marion's techniques, other than to
say that I enjoyed hearing some of the results in a tape he sent me a while
back.  But I haven't seen much reason to believe that exploring a new equal
temperament requires more preparatory work than exploring a new JI system of
similar complexity.  Perhaps Marion can expound a little further on his
techniques for exploring a wide variety of tunings (perhaps comparing them to
algorithmic composition techniques?), and why he finds that JI systems are
easier to explore in that manner.
