I do agree that in most cases the diatonic scale existed without a 
standardized tuning. I believe that the creation of similar tetrachords was 
the only guiding principle in most cases, since I do not believe that 
5-limit or higher ratios are relevant to purely melodic music. The 3-limit 
(and even 2-limit) approximations have a wide range of tolerance when 
harmony is not an issue, or when inharmonic instruments make the value of 
just intonation questionable. Many of the pentatonic scales of Southeast 
Asia and Africa exhibit two identical or nearly identical "trichords" each 
spanning a perfect fourth. A pentatonic scale with only two step sizes, such 
as in China or Thailand, obeys the principle of two identical trichords in 
every octave species.

What is "mystical" about Ptolemy is that he insisted on superparticular 
ratios and a geocentric universe with purely circular motions as if these 

were some sort of revealed truths. They ended up requiring exceedingly 
complicated models to approach the fairly simple realities. It is just as 
fair to criticize his views as it is to criticize Aristotelian physics. 
Where would the world be if no one had ever criticized Aristotelian physics? 
If a schoolteacher were to teach Aristotelian physics today, would it not be 
fair to criticize them? If the Greeks had not their absolutist 
Pythagorean/Platonic insistence on ratios in explaining everything, to the 
extent that the discovery of irrational numbers was a forbidden secret, 
would they not have progressed farther in mathematics and science? In 
particular, would some mathematician not have interpreted Aristoxenus' ideas 
in terms of the twelfth root of two? I'm sorry if it's not politically 
correct to identify the intellectual stumbling blocks of past civilizations.

Matt, you could be given a Mozart string piece which would have to descend 
by, say, seven commas from beginning to end, if it is to have all chords in 
just intonation and no comma shifts in sustained tones (this is actually a 
typical scenario). Even though the beginning and ending keys may be notated 
exactly, you would say that the piece ends in a distincly different key than 
it began. Would your analysis reflect the musical reality better than the 
traditional analysis? I think not! What if the piece was a keyboard piece? 
Forget it!

Perhaps your platonic ideal is just intonation, and mine is a fixed diatonic 
scale. Perhaps we both need to loosen up a bit, and admit that both are 
sometimes compromised in favor of the other. The point of compromise can 
depend on such factors as the tempo of the piece. Slow tempi demand just 
intonation, while fast tempi demand symmetrical, digestible melodic 
patterns. The best musicians intuitively understand both ideals and how to 
compromise between them according to the musical situation. An analysis that 
purports to describe pitch in more accurate terms than what is actually 
notated would have to take these issues into account, or else it is nothing 
more than an exercise in Pythagorean mysticism.
