Subject: George Secor's 17-tone Well Temperment

From: Robert Lodge <rlodge@motown.lmco.com>

A while back,Bob Lee asked about Well-Temperments.He got a fine series
of responses about the historical tunings,explaining their circulating
nature and the differences in color between keys.It was emphasized that
the historical temps were 12 notes to the octave.
   I seem to remember hearing that George Secor of Scalatron fame had
developed a 17-tone WT.Could any Forum member detail this tuning and
its characteristics?Also whether it has ever been used for performance
or recording?
   Thanks in advance and thanks to the Forum members who have been such
a great help to me in the past (Chalmers,Rappoport,Starrett,Morrison,
and a special thanks to His Dudeness, Mr. Haverstick).
Best,Bob
