Subject: 88CET Demo Once Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

A number of people have asked what they need to do to get a copy of the 88CET
demo I mentioned earlier.  The answer is to just send me your mailing address
that's all.  I'm not charging for it or anything like that.  

   Much of the music on the demo I expect to release on my up-coming CD, so all
I ask for it is that:  1) You don't copy it around too much (or claim it's your
own music obviously), and 2) If you have any comments on the nature or quality
of the music, I'd be delighted to hear them.
