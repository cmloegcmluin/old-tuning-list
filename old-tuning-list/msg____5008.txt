Dear Mr. Tomes, 

Thank you for your comments regarding my paper. I have in turn been
reading your paper on just intonation, which is located at:

http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm


I think you have many fine ideas, such as translating passages of
traditionally notated music with variable pitch sets. I will take more
time later to delve into the details.

I have devised a mechanism similar to the keyboard system in your paper.
In my translator, a Csound orchestra stores variable pitch sets (12
members each) in wave tables, then looks them up as they are needed
according to values stored in the score.

For the purposes of pedagogy, especially at the introductory level, I
try to avoid references to traditional tuning systems. Doing so
eliminates the unnecessary step of translating from a limited, fixed
system into an unlimited one. For this reason, I left comparisons and
translations between equal temperament and just intonation out of the
most recent version of my paper.

As to some specific details, I believe you are incorporating intervals
in your Mozart example that are not in keeping with the classical style.
For example, you use octave equivalents of 7/4 as some of your frequency
ratios. I challenge you or anyone to create a dominant seventh chord,
using the number seven as a multiple in the denominator of the chord’s
seventh, that would not sound out of place in a piece of chamber music
by Mozart.

I would suggest giving it the acid test, which would be to make a WAV
sound file of your Mozart score using Csound. With the tempo nice and
slow, try 7/4, then 16/9 as the relative frequency for the seventh of
your dominant chord.

Under such conditions, nearly everyone would agree the ratio 16/9 is a
much better selection for music of this period. I cannot provide an
airtight proof of why this is the case, but my ear and 30+ years
experience as a musician tell me it is so. I can point out that from the
major scale provided by Helmholtz in his book, “Sensations of a Tone”,
the relationship of 16/9 for the seventh of a dominant seventh chord may
be inferred.

You state, ”Some intervals such as a minor sixth may be interpreted as
7/4, 16/9 or 9/8 depending on circumstances.”

Without going into the potential merits of your statistical approach to
pitch selection, I must point out that 7/4 is approximately a minor
seventh; 16/9 is an in-tune minor seventh; and 9/8 is a major second.
Certainly none of these ratios is a minor sixth. I assume this is just a
grammatical error.

When I stated in my paper that pieces of traditional tonal music could
not be translated without modification from traditional notation into
integer ratios, I could have elaborated further with the following two
points:

1. Often, such as when employing chromatic scales, the composer is
simply filling in the space from point A to point B with notes. Such
passages do not need to be translated, nor often can they be, into
ratios. One might even argue that such passages are not really music,
but rather more like dust on a mirror.

2. Composers of the past wrote their music using limited instruments and
tuning systems that were available at the time. We should not expect to
translate their imperfect creations into a purely mathematical
framework; in fact, we should be surprised when it is possible to do so.

In my paper, I have included one such surprise, complete with a WAV
sound file generated in Csound. This entire two-part invention, a lovely
gem by Bach, can be tuned according to the principles given 130 years
ago by Hermann Helmholtz. The Csound orchestra, score and WAV file are
located at:

http://www.terraworld.net/users/r/robert/htmlpap7.htm


In the Csound score for this two-part invention, every interval is
provided in the last two parameter fields, columns 5 and 6. The bars are
numbered clearly to facilitate comparison with an actual score.

Regarding the problems you are having with the graphics in my paper,
would you please contact me if you experience additional difficulties? I
have reloaded all ten HTML files off my server quite easily using only 8
megs of RAM while running a minimum of applications and windows.

I look forward to studying your paper, as well as examining your many
other papers, in greater detail.

Best regards,


Robert Asmussen
