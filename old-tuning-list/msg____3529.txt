Subject: TAG festival screw ups....

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

Uh, oh. Looks like I slipped and sent a message to Tuning 
list that had no tuning content. This years Trenton Avant 
Garde Festival Composer's Series has NO MUSIC WITH A 
TUNING OTHER THEN 12TET. Sorry about any confusion.

THIS IS WHAT I DID WANT TO SEND. The compilation from 
last year's electro-acoustic recital which has my piece Science 
Friction, see the notes below.

Check the full notes at url:

>From the original program notes:

David Beardsley - Science Friction

Science Friction uses the ratios of just intonation tuning and 
rhythm as compositional elements. The tuning used: 
1/1, 17/16, 9/8, 19/16, 5/4, 21/16, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 27/16,
7/4, 15/8. The composition was realized at Endorphin 
Computer Music Studios, Rahway, N.J.

    *     *     *     *     *     *  


BTW: this problem of me sending the wrong mail to tuning 
digest will stop!

If anyone is still interested in attending this years recital, 
the classical guitarist who was to play my guitar piece 
canceled two hours ago. I am currently making a dat tape 
of some older pieces also based on ratios of rhythm. (Sorry, no JI!)
