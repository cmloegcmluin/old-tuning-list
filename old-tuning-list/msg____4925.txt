The first source which comes to mind is Thomas McGeary's article 
"German-Austrian Keyboard Temperaments and Tuning Methods, 1770-1840: 
Evidence from Contemporary Sources". Unlike Barbour, McGeary isn't 
spoilt by any over-egging of the equal-tempered pudding, and, as I 
glance over it, it looks well researched and generally reliable (it's 
a few years since I read it, so if anyone else has comments ...). The 
only catch is that it appeared in the Journal of the American Musical 
Instrument Society (Vol.XV, 1989, pp.90-118) so you may require an 
inter-library loan to obtain it. A substantial and important part of 
McGeary's argument is devoted to establishing that Kirnberger II never 
had the prominence in practice that a few later treatises might 
suggest -- I think this is done convincingly.

As for a disparity between the German speaking lands and elsewhere ... 
well that's precisely why I inserted the qualifying phrase 
"German-speaking lands" in my sentence from yesterday's message: 
"equal temperament was in the process of supplanting well-tempered 
systems for keyboards in the German-speaking lands during Mozart's 
lifetime". Both France and England moved over to equal temperament at 
a much later stage, but 50 or 75 years rather than 100 years after 
Germany/Austria (you already know the time when Broadwood made the 
change). I would guess that the reason we know precisely when a given 
French or English maker switched to equal temperament in the first 
half of the 19th century but can speak only of a gradual change in 
Germany during the second half of the 18th is because piano tuning had 
largely become a task of professionals by the time of the 
French/English changes, whereas many or most players were capable of 
tuning their own pianos at the time the changes occured in Germany. Am 
I right?

Chopin is the first important composer of piano music whom I can 
recall making a statement about his decided preference for equal 
temperament -- this was because it was still a matter of controversy 
in France. Beethoven's well-known pronouncements on key 
characteristics should not be taken to imply that he preferred some 
variety of well-temperament, because he is also on record as claiming 
that he could distinguish between C# major and Db major (!), which, I 
need hardly say, is not a distinction that can be made in any 
well-temperament. I would accept that Beethoven's notions concerning 
key characteristics originated in part from the well-temperament that 
he must have been familiar with in his youth, but if the connection 
between the two had been of great importance to him, we should expect 
him to have made statements on the lamentable erosion of key 
characteristics through the adoption of equal temperament (especially 
since by the time he was making his pronouncements on key 
characteristics, equal temperament was almost universally employed in 
Germany/Austria).

But don't stop at my speculations -- read McGeary. If you have 
problems obtaining his article, I would expect that general sources 
such as Grove would soon furnish the requisite information, though in 
less detail.
