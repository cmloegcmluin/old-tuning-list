What is the definition of "doubly positive?" Do you mean, two positive 
systems separated by exactly one-half octave? If so, I hope you don't give 
away any more of my secrets, at least until XH 17 comes out, which is, when? 
Or did someone else come up with the idea of two positive systems separated 
by exactly one-half octave before I did? (My paper includes, in addition to 
new ideas on what 22-tet does, two optimized "doubly positive (?)" systems 
for doing what 22-tet does. 22-equal actually falls in between the 
unweighted and weighted solutions, which no other equal tuning without 
vastly more notes can claim.)

Also worth considering are doubly negative systems resembling 26-tet and 
triply positive systems resembling 27-tet, if I am using this language 
correctly.
