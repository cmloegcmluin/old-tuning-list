Subject: names, JI, ands ET

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

Re Jonathan Walker's contribution to the JI/ET nomenclature issue:

I don't disagree with much; I am merely coming at this from a different
approach. The syntonic comma and other intervals are (among other things)
relations and are expressed or not in various ETs. To recognize this fact
requires their use and name, because they function in those tunings at
least partly as expected. As a byproduct they lead to at least a
preliminary notation based on something generalizable.

Although quartertones may be context dependent, all intervals to some
extent are, including those in JIs and ETs. The background assumption,
however, is that quartertones are 1/4 tone, just as 12-tET semitones are
2^(1/12). Whether any interval is realized close to its theoretical norm
is an interesting question but doesn't affect the point, I think.

Lowinsky's use of quartertones is indeed clever in a way but sounds like
it goes back to a loose use of the term which I think is better avoided.
If it isn't 24-tET or something in which tones are divided into 4, it's
clearer and better to find a more exact name, which isn't hard.

This, as they say, "is where I came in." Thanks to JW for some worthy
ideas.
