Subject: Tape swap project

From: John_Gzowski@goodmedia.com (John Gzowski)

Hi folks, John Gzowski here. The tape swap sounds like a really good idea, and
I think it might be possible to go one step further. I run a hard disk
editing system in Toronto and would consider trying to help put together a
tuning list cd. I could do the editing for free, and press the master cd as
well. It would cost about $2000 US to press 1000 copies though. There are a
couple of routes that we could take to make it go. The contributors could
cough up a couple of hundred bucks and get lots of cd's back (depends on how
many tracks). We could also see who on the list would be interested in buying
copies and figure some presales into the total cost. If this is the case it
may be possible to do the whole thing without the composers spending too
much. The whole thing would be revenue neutral and help promote micro music.
I've heard some excellent pieces by Neil H. and Johnny Reinhard and I know
there must be more out there.
I think the tape project might be more practical and cheap, but if there is
enough interest this could be a better alternate.
