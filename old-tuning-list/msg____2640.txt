Subject: Tuning files

From: non12@delta1.deltanet.com (John Chalmers)

I have placed binhex 4.0 encoded, compressed ascii files of most of 
my JiCalc scale archives in the Mills ftp site (in the CCM mac 
software directory along with JiCalc). JiCalc 4.2 runs under Hypercard 
2.0 or above on the Mac. It is shareware and is available both from 
the Mills ftp site and from the Just Intonation Network. Hypercard 
readers do not appear to support all of the JiCalc functions, so the
HC 2.X application is essential to use these files.
 
The files are JCA.sit.hqx, JCB.sit.hqx, JCC.sit.hqx, TC.sit.hqx and 
a short non-binhex encoded readme file, JC/TC_README. The files may be 
uncompressed and decoded with Expander, Unstuffit or similar programs.
 
JCA and JCB have 400 tunings each and JCC 396. The TC file has 590
entries, most of them from my book, "Divisions of the Tetrachord." 
The uncompressed and decoded files may be read with any word processor 
or inserted into a JiCalc stack with the READALL command. I recommend 
using multiple stacks renamed for each file, at least on the older, 
slower Mac's. 
 
The scales are a mixture of JI, tetrachordal, CPS, tritriadic, tempered,
McLarenish, etc. and are not always fully documented as they represent 
various research interests of mine over the last 8 or 9 years. Because 
some early versions of JiCalc did not permit one to annotate entries, 
some entries are rather cryptic. However, I think most will be of 
interest to at least some of the Tuning List readers.
 
In JiCalc, all scales, equally-tempered, non-octaval, non-Just, non-ET, 
etc. must be expressed as ratios, either exact or approximate in the 
case of tempered or other irrational intervals. The approximations are 
usually within 0.1 cent and were generated by the use of Carter Scholz's algorithm or by Viggo Brun's version of the well-known Euclidean algorithm 
for approximating irrationals. 
 
These four files contain more or less the same tunings as Manuel Op de 
Coul's SCALA, though in a different format as his program can combine 
cents with ratios. This resemblance is not entirely accidental; Manuel 
and I have been exchanging scales by email. His program, however, is more
than just a tuning editor.
 
JiCalc may be used to tune a number of popular synthesizers, particularly 
those made by Yamaha and Ensoniq. Full-keyboard tuning is supported and 
scales do not have to repeat at the octave (or at all). Adding new scales 
to JiCalc is easy and the program comes with a very good help file.
