Actually re a generalized MIDI keyboard:
Would it really be so difficult to get a suitable number of
standard MIDI keyboards and mechanically mount them close above
each other (like an organ but a lot closer), then set each to
it's own channel for input to a computer that does the real
work?
My keyboard is barely 2" thick, it would be easy to trim the naturals
to 1/2" longer than the sharps without damaging anything, and
even my cheap version of Cubase (Compact) will handle multiple
keyboards - any Creative soundcard sold today will handle the
microtuned sound acceptably direct from Cubase without any
extra programming.
Or, have I misunderstood what is being asked for?
