Subject: K2000 & microtuning

From: james@astro.as.utexas.edu (James McCartney)

I've made a demo of using the K2000 for microtuning. I'll email it to
anyone interested. You need a Mac, MAX and a K2000 to use this demo.
Here's part of the README:

I've been using doing microtuning on the K2000 for several years and whenever
someone posts to the tuning list that the K2000 is unfit for microtuning I try
and refute it, but no one seems to remember so here's the proof.

The files in this folder demonstrate my method of doing microtuning on the
K2000. You need a Mac, MAX and a K2000 to use this demo.
There are two files:

'XJIFILE.KRZ'  -- this is a K2000 file. You need to copy it onto an IBM
    formatted floppy and load it into the K2000. Select one of the two patches
    in this bank to be on MIDI channel 1.

'K2000 microtune demo' -- This is a MAX patch which demonstrates generating
    pitches for the K2000 patches.


I use FUN4 on the K2000 set to 'Sample B on A' with A set to 'ON' and B set to
MIDI controller 20. This samples MIDI controller 20 at a voice's note on and
holds it for the duration of the note. FUN4 is then used as a pitch modulator
with a depth of 100 cents for every oscillator in a patch.

If you have a PowerMac check out SuperCollider, a real time synth program:
