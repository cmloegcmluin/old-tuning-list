At least.

Well, the vast majority of the music was not the best music (i.e., Bach).

Perhaps. But by 1850, composers basically assumed they could modulate to any 
key, including G# major, and it would sound good. Whether this was a result 
of 12TET being shoved down their throats, I don't know.

This is off the topic by a few centuries, but what the heck. Byrd's Pavans 
and Galliards happen to be the only meantone recording I own, and certainly 
Byrd did for 12-tone meantone what Bach did for 12-tone circulating in the 
WTC. However, if I'm not mistaken, there is one place where Byrd uses a 
F-G#-C triad resolving to a C major triad (or some transposition of that). 
Whether you call that a wolf or a septimal minor triad is a matter of taste, 
I guess.

Meantone was in use for a long time after 1623, though.
