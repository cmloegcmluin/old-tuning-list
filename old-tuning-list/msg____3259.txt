Subject: Miscellany

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

PaulE: I don't recall exactly what I said or wrote to Brian, but I
did mention the problem of inharmonic complexes and residue pitches.
Beyond that I can't say.

As I recall,  Steve McAdams (SP?) showed that simultaneous and 
coincident modulation of the partials of inharmonic spectra leads to 
a sensation of fusion.

With considerable misgivings, I am posting two of Brian's messages on 
the adequacy of the bibliographies in certain of Paul Rapoport's tuning 
theory papers. As a sometime author myself, I would like to say that 
space alone does does not  permit every paper to list every conceivably 
relevant reference. What an author should do is to list the most 
pertinent 
references in the expectation that truly interested readers will pursue 
topic and author threads themselves. Bibliographies are primarily 
intended 
to give credit to previous investigators and data to support the author's 
conclusions or hypotheses, not to filibuster for the reader's own 
concerns. 
Unless the paper is a general review article, the bibliography does not 
have to cover the entire field of xenharmonics, only those items specific 
to the topic at hand.

Paul Rapoport and I agree that Brian's attacks verge on being slanderous, 
but like many of Brian's other papers, they contain interesting and useful
material beneath the hyperbolic rhetoric. Brian has uncovered and 
described 
some useful references which might otherwise be overlooked by other 
scholars, though some appear to me to be redundant and repetitive  (I've 
read Viggo Brun's articles in several languages and have found that the 
most important details of his version of the Euclidean algorithm are 
expressed equivalently).

'mbat larasati in the gamelan as far as I know is for shadow puppet
performances for example; gamelan STSI Solo, TBS Solo, Semarangan (Ki.
Nartosabdo), Notodiningratan and almost pupeteer's gamelan.
