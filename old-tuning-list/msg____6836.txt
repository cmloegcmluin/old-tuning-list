Subject: Planck's Glissando

What an interesting question.  If we figure this out, do we have
quantum music?  Would that be JI or ET or ?? :)

I don't think quantum mechanics is normally applied to sound, but
I suppose it could be.  It seems the practical answer to this
question is that Planck's constant is so small (6.626 x 10 to the
minus 34) that it's effect on a glissando wouldn't be discernable
to the average listener.

>If so, what is the octive equivalent of this fundamental?!

The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics give the units of Planck's
constant as J Hz -1.  I suppose this might translate to a
wavelength in some physics phantasy.  The reciprocal of Planck's
constant gives a frequency of 1.51 times 10 to the 33--a little
higher than most people can hear.
