Subject: Tables for Pitchbend to Cents

From: "Benjamin Tubb" <brtubb@cybertron.com>

I need a table of Pitchbend to 12tet Cents equivalents for the various semitone
ranges available for Pitch Bend Sensitivity which is the MIDI Registered
Parameter Number 0 (i.e. CC101=0 [MSB] and CC100=0 [LSB]).

Does anyone have such a table available, which I suspect is _not_ linear (or I
wouldn't ask <g> since I could figure such values in any spreadsheet which
indeed I already have)? I want values which have been verified at least by
actual frequency tuning analysis for _every_ Pitchbend value (-8192 to +8192)
among _every_ "sensitivity" (1-12 semitone range) setting.

If anyone knows that these values are indeed logarithmic in respect to a
certain _applied formula_, I would prefer to know that formula _most of all_ of
course.
