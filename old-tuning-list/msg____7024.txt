You're right. If the decatonic approximation to the 3/2 is much less
than 707 cents, the decatonic approximation to the 7/4 becomes too
out-of-tune. If the decatonic 3/2 is larger than 711 cents, the
decatonic 5/3 becomes too out-of-tune. Compare this 4-cent range with a
range of about 8 cents (692-700) for the diatonic approximation to the
3/2.

This "sameness" and "in-tune-ness" are surprisingly flexible, especially
when it comes to multiple octaves. Playing the same melody on opposite
ends of a piano simultaneously, you can get away with a semitone
transposition without much disturbing the "sameness" or "in-tune-ness"
(Yasser gives a melody to use for this, and I didn't believe it until I
tried it!)

For another example, take 26TET. Here the major seventh is nowhere near
15:8 -- in fact it nails 24:13, halfway between 13:7 and 11:6. Both
these intervals would be much more important in describing how the 26TET
major 7th is heard than 15:8. And yet, since the consonances are still
OK, the major seventh chord sounds smooth, perhaps smoother than in
12TET. This is mainly because the roughness between the 2nd harmonic of
the root and the fundamental of the major 7th is lessened as the major
7th gets smaller.

This is one of my arguments against using anything beyond level-1
odd-limit considerations in evaluating temperaments. Also this hints at
why I don't think it can be relevant whether a tuning nails 25:18.
