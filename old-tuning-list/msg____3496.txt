Subject: Micrtonal wind instruments

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Martin Vogel has constructed "enharmonic" jazz and concert trumpets
as well as tubas and french horns for playing in JI. For details,
pictures and fingering charts, see his books, "Die Zukunft der Musik," 
and "On the Relations of Tone," the English translation of his "Die Lehre 
von dem Tonbeziehungen." All three are in the ORPHEUS series of 
monographs, which he edits and many libraries carry. Most of the volumes 
are only in German, however.

Mandelbaum references an article by Sigmund Stein, "Quarter-Tone Data"
in the Pro-Musica Quarterly of March 1925. This article mentions
a quarter-tone trumpet built in Odessa, Russia in the 19th century and
quarter-tone clarinets.

Haba's used  quarter-tone trumpets and clarinets in his 1/4-tone opera 
"Die Mutter" in the 1920's.  (from Mandelbaum's dissertation, p.141).
A modern performance of this work has been recorded by Supraphone and 
may still be available.

A well-known American jazz musician (Don Ellis?) plays a quarter-tone 
trumpet.

I don't know if Wyschnegradsky used quarter-tone wind instruments,
but either Franck Jedrzejewski or the people at Montreal should know.
A fourth valve is necessary, but apparently the the modifications are
not too complex.
