I would be grateful for a tabulated list that supports John's i mpression.
When I was surveying practical tuning manuals for my study of tuning
in German-speaking areas 1770-1828, just the opposite was the pattern.
All the real keyboard teachers (Turk, Loehlien, Mueller, Czerny, and
Hummel) EXPLICITLY recommended equal temperament: they just as clearly
mentioned the existence of, and rejected, MT and Kirnberger II.

Is is usually the pattern, that it is the mathematicians, the theorists,
the gentleman natural scientists, and the like, who are fascinated by
the mental problem of temperament that explored all the sublted
 subtle, that is, temperaments.
