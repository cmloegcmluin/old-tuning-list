Yes, they do have more surface area, and they could even be seaid to
contain their own resonators, since they are hollow.  But, even so,
it is the air that carries the vibrations which stimulatie the 
sympathetic vibrations, not a sounding board connected to the
original stimulauus and not cables or anything. else.  Sound waves can
travel through air, water, wire , etc.  On a sitar, the vibrations
may travel from the plucked string to the sympathetic string through
the air and/or the soundboard; in either case the resonator of the
soundbaoard will serve as an amplifier to make the all the sounding
strings louder.

Now htathat I think about it, I remember quite a few years ago payinglaying
a solo flute piece with the soundboard of the pieano open.  PLlaying
the flute near the piano strings with the dampers off caused the
same effect of certain strings vibrating sympathetically.  Of course,
the soundboard of the piano was not connected directly to the flute!
So the aire m must have been a sufficient carrier of the sound waves
to stimulate the strings.

Best,

Lydia
