Subject: Chinese 12TET - overkill?

From: Johnny Klonaris <johnny@athena.ptp.hp.com>

It's been an interesting discussion on whether or not Prince Tsai-Yu
could have done the math....

Nope.  All posters I've seen seemed to have missed a simple solution:
all that is needed to calculate the 12th or any other root is
multiplication and some time.  Successive approximation might seem like
a tedious method in this day and age, but 12 multiplications will tell
you if you're close - and 12 more will tell you if your next guess is
closer or not.
