Subject: xen wind instruments, I'm curious

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Greetings All,

This goes back to the microtonal flute thread from May.
Please forgive my ignorance about the details of the workings
of wind instruments.  I've just begun to seriously think about 
microtonal wind instruments and have a few questions. 

>From what I understand, many players achieve different tunings
by using various fingerings. From this list, I know this has been
done on flute and bassoon. To which other wind instruments has this
approach been applied ? And, what types of tunings are possible ?

The other approach is of course instruments that are physically 
altered from their std. forms, to achieve non-std. pitches. Logic
would argue that there probably aren't many users of these instruments 
around. Any thoughts/ comments ?

Is there a good source of info out there for someone wanting
to write parts for these instruments  ? Though ultimately it would 
require personally working with the people who are to actually 
perform the parts, to fine tune the writing to match their actual
physical abilities. Thoughts ?

Regards,
Drew
