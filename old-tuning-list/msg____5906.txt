   Here's a brief rundown of the nature of my microtonal music:

   Most of it is in a "classical" style, in the general sense of the word,
and it's generally fairly conventional except for the the tunings.  I
mostly write for small ensembles of orchestral instruments.

   My composition methodology usually involves the old approach of
conjuring up the music in my head, writing it down little by little, and
then performing it once it's all pretty much prenotated.  I have begun
recently, however, to vary that process more toward the "composing at the
keyboard", or even improvisation-based approach.

   I perform the majority of it on my Ensoniq ASR-10, although I do some on
guitar.  I sequence it on my Mac IIfx running EMagic's Logic Audio
(although thus far I haven't used the audio features yet).

   The best characterization of the most commonly-cited shortcoming of my
music, it is that it sounds too "stark".  That's partly inherent in the
nature of small-ensemble music, which people aren't terribly familiar with
these days.  But also it's because of the comparatively sterile methods I
use to produce my music.

   To that end I've been working recently on some more realistic sampling
material.  (That is when I'm not working 12-16 hours/day plus weekends like
I have been for the past couple months!)  I've also been working on some
tools to manipulate sequences to make them more natural-sounding.  But more
importantly, I've been taking (soprano) saxophone lessons so that I can
more expressively and efficiently use my WX-11 saxophone-fingered MIDI
controller.
