Hello Charles,

We met in Los Angeles a number of years ago and I showed you
the graphics for a tuning-generation program I was designing 
on the Amiga computer.

By definition, "harmonics" don't beat. 

The more inclusive term "partials" is now used to describe
the sine wave components of timbre, whether those partials
are harmonic (relating in whole numbers) or inharmonic.

You seem to be confusing the beating within a single
note due to inharmonicity of partials with the beating
between two or more notes in various intervalic
relationships. To hear appreciate the former, no tuning 
is needed.

If an acoustic instrument can produce a beating timbre,
a sampler can--simply sample the instrument.
