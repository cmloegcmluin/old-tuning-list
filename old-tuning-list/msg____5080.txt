Low frequencies (beyong hearing) in particular can resonate with body
parts and organs and affect us in that way.  This is a fast track way to
many emotions, feelings and even pleasure and pain.

It was discovered not so long ago that although people could not hear
frequencies above 22kHz which is the maximum CD frequency that some
could tell the difference between (say) 15kHz waves with different
timbre or different overtones.  Some CD manufacturers now add overtones
to the high frequencies because that normally produces a more natural
sound.  This little trick does fool those individuals who could tell the
difference before.
