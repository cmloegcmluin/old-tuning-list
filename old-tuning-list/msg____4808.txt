I have a Yamaha DX-21 keyboard too. You can't retune them.
Get a Yamaha TX-81Z (4-operator rack-mount midi module) or 
a DX7-II (6-operator keyboard), or a DX7-II fd (6-operator 
keyboard with floppy disk to hold extra timbre patches).
There's also a rack-mount version of the DX7-II, but I 
forget its model name. Tunable Yamaha instruments offer
a resolution of 1024 steps per octave.

The DX21's bulk dumps are complicated. Call Yamaha, or
find them on the 'net, to get the "midi specification"
document for any of their instruments.
