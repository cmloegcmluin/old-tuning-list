I've used Pitch Palette and it would make retuning easier, but it's main
application is in realtime pitch table changes and modulations.  It might be
overkill for what you're trying to do.  The Synth Help page at my web site
has a page on GS/Sound Canvas MIDI tuning codes generously contributed by
Ben Tubb.  I also have a link to the Roland GS MIDI System Exclusive
specification.  My web site is at:  http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink .  You
should be able to create a short MIDI message that you could embed into any
sequencer program to retune the Virtual Sound Canvas.
