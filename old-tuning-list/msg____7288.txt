From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

To fill in a bit on Joe Monzo's post, there is an unpublished translation
of Werckmeister's 1691 monograph Musikalische Temperatur (Quedlinberg).

My cents calculations were made from the written description of Andreas
Werckmeister's own explanation.  Joe wrote of my choosing A=440 as a
constant, as well as working the tuning instructions around this constant.

For some reason Joe has not explained where the tuning calculations are
expressed incorrectly.  I think it is important to point out published
errors (though their damn near impossible to correct..so few revised later
editions).  While an important book in awakening the electronic musicians
to microtones, Scott Wilkinson's _Tuning In_ has some wild notes listed
for Werckmeister III.  I wonder, Gary, do they match those of Werckmeister
IV or V?
