Subject: JICalc alternat. for PC,Synth tuning,...

I believe Scala might do the trick ! On 23rd Mar  Manuel Op de Coul 
announced a bug fixed
 release version 1.4 . It's at
<ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/pc/scala/scala14.zip>
J.Starrett's page should have a link to more info about it 
<www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html>

Agreed.I hope everyone's optimism about what synth makers will do bears 
fruit. I snuck in the 
wet blanket thing because the thread was getting a little too happy ;-) 
One of the reasons
I prefer a sceptical view is I'm never dissapointed and I've seen so much 
craziness in general,
almost nothing surprises me anymore.

Well, to be more accurate, one sec. of mono 16-bit,44.1KHZ sound should 
take @86 to 95KB.
What's up with the "(remotely?)" bit ? Someone please correct me if I've 
got something
wrong.

Plus,most samplers cannot hold 128 samples per "instrument"/channel. 
You'd have to 
use more than one channel to set up a 128-note multi-sample instrument.

I checked & in Digest 1393 Gary (not David) said :

etc.

And in Digest 1400 David First wrote :

etc.

Which is what I meant by the looping not being  a recipe for long term 
sanity.
Besides which, when things get too convoluted the room tends to spin. 
I'm not much for delayed gratification.

Speaking of D.First, a wee article about him in Guitar Player somewhere 
between 
1991  and 1993 (I think) was possibly the first time I read about 
microtones. They did an
 article on Glen Branca too @ the same time (maybe).
David, I remember reading it with fascination and it's a little weird 
being on the 
same list and quoting snippets of wisdom.

Later ,eh ?
