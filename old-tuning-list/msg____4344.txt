Subject: JiCalc4.4, SAG talk

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I downloaded Carter's latest version of the JiCalc 4.4 beta HyperCard 
stack from the Mills ftp siteand have been greatly enjoying plotting 
scales with the new LATTICE function. This version runs on both older
and new Macs withor without QuickTime and QuickTime Musical Instruments.
HC 2.0 or above is essential, though, but System 6.07 is adequate.

The LATTICE routine factors ratios and plots those at the 31 prime 
limit or lower on a N-dimensional Cartesian "perspective" plot 
similar to that used by Erv Wilson. Ratios involving higher primes are 
simply skipped, and notes differing by a single step in any dimension 
are connected by lines. Clicking on either the node or a ratio in the 
list of notes highlights both items.

I've customized my copy by patching in Steve Curtin's Fret Position
routine, whose button is easily added to the scale card background by 
slightly rearranging the right hand side of the card without losing
any of the pre-existing functions. I placed the string length field to 
the right of the Name field at the top of the card. In addition to 
the Fret Position, I created another function by replacing the 
indicated line in Steve's script with the statement below. This script 
calculates the vibrating String Length instead of the fret or moveable
bridge position.

Replace the line "put ((line 1 of field i)-(line 2 of field i))/(line 
1 of field i)  into ratio" by the statement "put (line 2 of field i)/
(line 1 of field i) into ratio" (omitting the quotes).

Two small buttons for FP and SL fit in a single line just below
the new LATTICE button. Linking these buttons to the HELP stack and
creating new cards for them is quite easy in HyperTalk by analogy
from existing cards and buttons. 

I heartily recommend that any user of JiCalc get this version. It's
great fun and seeing the lattice makes it easy to spot errors, find
chords, etc.

I presented a revised version of my ICMC 97 tutorial with a new example 
DAT compiled by Brian McLaren last night at the Sonic Arts Gallery in 
San Diego. Though the audience was small, there were numerous questions
and due to the number and length of the musical examples, I decided to
present only the introduction and the JI parts. I'll probably do the
temperament sections later if there is sufficient interest.
