Subject: Microtonality in France

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

Hello,
I would like to describe the situation of microtonality in France.
I am sure Franck will complete my words and I wish he will...

Chapter One - Composers

We have two big institutional mouvements :

1- Spectral music, represented by Tristan Murail, Hugues Dufourt, Gerard
Grisey, Michael Levinas, Philippe Durville, Philippe Hurel...
They use 1/4tone as approximations of high & non-tempered harmonics,
multiphonics, and electronics

2- A post-serial complexity, inaugured by Alain Bancquart and followed by
many of his students (he was at the head of the composition departement at
the Paris National Conservatory).
Cryptic counterpoint with 1/4tone series...

Beside that, there are few independant figures:
Maurice Ohana, 1/3tone
Claude Ballif, 
Pascale Criton, from the Wyshnegradsky descendance, 1/16tone
Pascal Dusapin, 1/4 & 1/8tone
Alain Louvier, 1/4 &1/3tone

Exepted spectral music, they all use equal divisions of the tone.

AND.....................The only french composer using Just Intonation :
Jacques Dudon, composer, theorician, instruments conceptor, who is now
almost exclusively dedicated to his new invention : "Harmonic sounds
opticaly generated by Photo-sonic process". For info, he will publish soon
an article in 1/1.


To be continued..................................................Didier Aschour
