1.  A fair number of writers were advocating 12TET by the mid-1700s.
Most of them had plenty of experience tuning (and in some cases
building) keyboard instruments.  Why shouldn't some of them have had
sufficient practise to hear 12TET thirds and fifths?  (Someone once
posted a quote from Werckmeister to this list in which he describes
distributing the comma equally among all 12 fifths, then says that a
circulating temperament sufficed for a local church, but only ET was
suitable for a court.)  To be sure, having an exact scheme would make
things much easier, but I don't see why someone with a good ear couldn't
make a passable ET with enough fiddling.

2.  A big problem with Jorgensen (many think) is that he makes too much
of equal beating.  If you look at most surviving tuning instructions,
they're worded far too vaguely for one to confidently presume that they
actually refer to intervals beating _at the same rate_.  It's quite
plausible that the language merely refers to the fact that tempered
intervals beat, and that two intervals are tempered about the same
distance from just.  It doesn't take Helmholtz to figure out that
equally tempered intervals beat faster the higher they are in pitch.
