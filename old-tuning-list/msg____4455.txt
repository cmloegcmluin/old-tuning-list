   Musical math, to me, is a lot like any other form of applied math:  It's
a model of how our ears hear (or a collection of models actually).  That in
the sense that it's based upon experimental observation, and can be used to
predict structures that may prove musically useful - structures that would
have been hard to predict otherwise.  And as with any other model, its
predictions must be tested experimentally in real music.  

   As for proofs though...  That's probably be a pretty good analogy at the
level of musical form and, as John suggested, thematic development.  Most
classical forms, are designed to make the unfolding of the music not only
interesting and emotionally exciting, but also to take on a sense of
inevitability, indeed somewhat like a mathematical proof.  

   I doubt, however, if there's much similarity between mathematical proofs
and, for example, the whole-number-ratio notion of consonance.
