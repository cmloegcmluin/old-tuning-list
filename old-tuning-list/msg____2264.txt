   Oooop.  Typo there:  "The attitude..." should read "That attitude...".  As in
"That sort of attitude on my part...".  He doesn't seem to grasp how difficult
not being able to call him makes a collaborative project.  

   Sorry, I'm not trying to air dirty laundry, it just gets frustrating, and I
wouldn't mind if others who might have felt this frustration, would prod at him
