A great opportunity for me to reminisce about this _great_ quartet!  It was
commissioned by Kronos, but of course not -exlusively- for them (Kronos'
standard exclusive-performance rights are three years).  I had the great
pleasure of attending rehearsals and a performance of this work, played by
the Klangforum Wien Quartet (part of a terrific new-music ensemble,
featuring a couple of former members of the Hagen Quartet), in a beautiful
and resonant church in early 1995.  The subtitle is "The Magic Chord x4,"
and is based on the "Dream Chords" from the "Well-Tuned Piano", played as
natural harmonics of open strings.  Very exact JI is required, and a Rayna
Synthesizer is provided with the part-rentals.

This was Young's first fully-notated work in about 20 years, and it is to
me (a classical-person at heart) his most beautiful work.  Fans of the
Dream House and such computer-driven installations will most likely rejoice
in the respiratory phrases of this work, while sacrificing very little
tuning precision.  A bonus effect, one not intended by La Monte, is the
subtle increase in harmonic beating as the 2-hour-plus work progresses,
simply due to the settling of strings and changing of temperature in the
cold church.
