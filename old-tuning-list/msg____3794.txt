   That strikes me as a curious comment considering that third-, quarter-,
fifth-, and sixth-comma meantone all have fifths smaller than 700c.

   I'm inclined to agree.  I suspect that Manuel used that either as a just a
convenient point of comparison.  Or perhaps he used it from the more
well-temperamentish perspective of being able to sum the temperings of fifths
around the circle (12 total) and arrive at -1.  That of course only works when
you temper things in terms of the pythagorean comma rather than syntonic.
