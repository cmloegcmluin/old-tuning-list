Subject: Invitation to Lurkers to Contribute

From: randy@tcm.mit.edu

As Johnny Reinhard and Gary Morrison have both extended this
invitation and since I have been feeling somewhat lurkish lately,
here's my introduction.

I've been following the tuning list since sometime in 1994.  I've been
interested in non-12tET tunings for about 10 years.  Discussions on
this list got me interested in non-12 ETs and non-octave tunings.  I
have recorded several hours of improvisations in various tunings on my
cranky old synth.  Whenever I read something about a new tuning that
strikes my interest, such as Mayumi Reinhard's Harmonic 13, I just
have to try it out to see what I can do with it.

I read Hindemith's "Craft of Musical Compositition" in the late 70s,
and it made a lot of sense to me at the time, but the discrepancy
between the harmonic series and its 12tET representation didn't hit me
until I tuned up some actual pitches on a synth in 1985.  I recorded
some pieces with harmonic series pitches and JI tunings around that
time.

I had heard some microtonal music during my college studies (in the
mid-70s; some Partch and Stockhausen and a few others) and some
"non-Western" musics (Gamelan, etc.), but I had always brushed it off
as being part of a fringe that didn't interest me much at the time.  I
even performed in a wind ensemble that tackeled a piece full of big
harsh quarter tone clusters.  So, some academics cover the topic even
if they aren't overly enthusiastic about it.  Enthusiasm (or lack of)
communicates a lot about the importance of a subject.

A couple of years ago, Brian McLaren sent me a copy of Ivor Darreg's
"Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier."  My first listening to this music
drastically altered my musical perceptions - probably the single most
influential musical event for me in 10 years.  Since then I've been
playing with ETs, JIs and non-octave tunings on a regular basis.

Just because I don't post often, please don't get the wrong
impression.  I read every tuning digest, follow the discussions, and
try out many of the ideas presented.  If I don't participate in the
theoretical discussions, it's because I'm not so inclined to do the
scholarly research necessary to follow up on some of the ideas
presented and I find that I'm often lacking a means to communicate my
non-verbal ideas about them anyway.  One of the biggest limitations of
this forum is that ASCII is the only means available to represent
ideas.  It'll be a different world once we're able to include sounds
as fluently as we now use text.
