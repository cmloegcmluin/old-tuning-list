Subject: Re: Trills:  Which Note First

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

One more footnote on my trill question:  Most replies also suggested
that it's more involved than just the era.  One respondent said that in
baroque repertoire it's really not the upper note, but the more dissonant
note.  Three people also mentioned that it depends on the note before it
but slightly disagreed on what the dependency is.

   Three respondents also suggested that it depends on the country, or I'd
think more likely the "school" (e.g., German-English vs. Italian vs.
French-Russian).

   So in short, like the Harvard folks said, it's an involved topic.

   With regard to jazz, I can't seem to conjure up any jazz piece with a
trill in it;  can any of you?  By that I mean a trill used in the classical
sense:  an ornament as a form of melodic accent, such as at a phrase ending.
That as opposed to, for lack of a better phrase, a stand-alone "effect".  
Then again, I mostly do classical and Baroque, so it probably wouldn't 
surprise me if there are some.
