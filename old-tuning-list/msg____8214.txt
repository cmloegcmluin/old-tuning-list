Subject: Basilar membrane

From: Jesse Bagshaw Gay <jgay@reed.edu>

In a response to my post, Carl(I think) questioned my claim that the
resonance of different areas of the basilar membrane was due to variation
in width.  He mentioned the fact that it is also due to variations in
stiffness.

i reply that variations in width and stiffness are not mutually exclusive.
