"Theremin Music and Tesla Lightning!"

What do exquisite music and crackly lightning have in common? They'll both
be in the air at the Hippodrome when therminist Denny Genovese teams up with
"Mr. Electricity" Robert Krampf, to put on a show you will never forget!

When Denny waves his hands over the theremin you'll hear sweet, yet
"unworldly" music.  In contrast, when Robert waves his hand over the Tesla
Coil, 4 foot bolts of lightning shoot from his head!

This show combines Art and Science in a spectacular, yet beautiful way.  
The sparks never reach the audience, and it is safe entertainment for children
and adults.

				THE ARTISTS
Denny Genovese is a composer, performer and educator, who loves science as
well as music. He  is one of the few musicians in the world who have
developed the ability to play the Theremin expressively.

Robert Krampf is a well known scientist and educator who specializes in
demonstrating the wonders of fire and electricity. Some of his tricks
include  lighting a light bulb in his hand without wires and passing
thousands of volts over his body making sparks and fire issue from his 
hands and face!

                          THE WORLD HARMONY PROJECT
The purpose of the World Harmony Project Inc. is to contribute to the evolution
of music as an art form.  In addition to educating music students, it
facilitates composers, performers, music theorists, instrument builders and
others who work toward this goal.  A music studio, instrument workshop,
music library and other resources are maintained for this purpose.  It is a
501(c)3 non-profit organization.

In addition, the World Harmony Project presents cultural programs that
showcase the work developed at our center and it facilitates broader
exposure to the multicultural roots of the world music that we are helping
to develop.  This is done by presenting performances of music and dance that
represent the various historical traditions of peoples throughout the world.
