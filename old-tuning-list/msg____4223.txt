That was me and the matter was resolved in
private email between David Doty and me MONTHS ago. 

Unfortunately, matters with McLaren can't be resolved by private email.

That's nice.

I have been in the family magazine subscription business for 12 years.
- am president of Satisfaction Software, Inc. for 3+ years.

between my father and I, we have more then 50 years in the biz.

- and have had, in the past, small publishers as customers who have:

1. run into legal problems with the USPO,
2. gone into bankruptcy because of those problems and 
3. we (and the subscribers!) got stiffed.

Hell, we've been even screwed by small publishers who didn't
have USPO problems and went out of business.

I AM NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING ABOUT 1/1. 
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS
OF 1/1.

You know a bit about tuning. 
You have a problem: go write an article for 1/1!

I've been involved with tuning for only a few years. So I
don't have great deal to share with 1/1 or the digest 
about tuning, and I'm clueless as to why McLaren 
has decided to pick on me - out of the blue. Perhaps
he has nothing better to do?

This brings me to my next point Mr. McLaren: 
besides being really nasty to lots of people through 
Tuning digest, what have you done with your life? 
Who are you and what do you do?

>put the magazine out?

Put your money where your mouth is. 


sorry 'bout the waste of bandwidth folks...
