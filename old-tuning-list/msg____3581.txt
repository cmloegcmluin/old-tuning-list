I am not sure that I could explain the puzzle but I give
some remarks on the problem pointed out by Brian.

Given a sound of frequency f, you could theoretically build all the
harmonics f, 2f, 3f, 4f, etc... Choose the first 2^n
harmonics and put them in the same octave by dividing
by a power of 2, you get what I call an "harmonic tuning"
Take n=4, you get 16 notes :
1	0 cents
17/16	105 cents
9/8	204 "
19/16	297
5/4	386
21/16	471
11/8	551
23/16	628
3/2	702
25/16	773
13/8	841
27/16	906
7/4	969
29/16	1030
15/8	1088
31/16	1145
2	1200

Take n=5, you get a 32 notes system :
1	0   cents
33/32	53    
17/16	105
35/32	155
9/8	204
37/32	251
19/16	297
39/32	342
5/4	386
41/32	429
21/16	471
43/32	512
11/8	551
45/32	590
23/16	628
47/32	666
3/2	702
49/32	738
25/16	773
51/32	807
13/8	841
53/32	874
27/16	906
55/32	938
7/4	969
57/32	999
29/16	1030
59/32	1059
15/8	1088
61/32	1117
31/16	1145
63/32	1173

Now, choose k notes in this Harmonic Tuning (HT), and find a best
approximation in terms of x-tet. That is : find x ? 
(Note : You could define several "best approximation".)
This is what Brian do in TD831.

The spectral composers have others problems. They don't want 
to find an approximation of their initial sounds. 
They use spectras as first materials of their compositions.
They take a sound or several : a sound from the street, a sound 
from a piano, evry kind of sound... But not noisy
because they want to read the composants of the sound
has frequencies. (why ? To be near electro-acoustic music research 
in using spectres ? To be far from the electro-acoustic music directions 
or esthetics in using discrete frequencies ? 
To be in the same logic as serial compositions : 
the series are in the serial music
as spectras are in spectral music : a structural element of
composition ? use to build the whole score ?)
The sound could have some harmonics very poor and partials very rich, 
so they are very far from the Harmonic Tuning systems.
They usually write music for
traditionnal orchestras (that could be played everywhere,
sometimes with synth. as DX7)
with their materials, they could use microtones.
Why not quarter tones ?
Quarter tones could be played by most instrumentists
and many are used in the XXth century music.
Could they have more rich panels with other tunings ?
Maybe yes, but actually I have not seen spectral compositions
with others tunings (in the traditionnal orchestral writings).
The spectral composers problems are not to find a "good" approximation
of their spectres. They want compose pieces of music with their own
materials used as a pretext, not as an atom of the whole composition but
as a "structure". The first material must not be exactly the initial sound.
I also would like to explain that structuralism is important in the
developpement of the thinking of spectral music, a music made 
by "reconstitution" of spectres, with "processus" to 
move to one representation to another, and where the dividing of
the whole tone is not a structural element, neither a "processus"
of composition : for spectral composers, it's only a data.
