Subject: Re: Patent Alert - Microsoft owns computer composition?

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Hey folks,

Do a search on "Todor Fay"; any search engine will do, I imagine. You'll
see he's been programming sound/midi/software stuff for quite a while, and
most of this was developed on the Amiga. Apparantly his last company, Blue
Ribbon Soundworks, got bought by Microsoft. Now they own his brain and it's
handywork.

If anyone is truly shocked, surf a bit until you find his email at
Microsoft and then try and convince him he was stupid to allow them to
co-opt his ideas. Me, I just accept this as the decline of Western
civilization in the late 20th century.

Oh, yes: can everyone please turn off their MIME encoding doo-hickeys when
posting to the list so we don't have to scroll through ASCII wallpaper?
Thanks....

Cheers,
Jon
