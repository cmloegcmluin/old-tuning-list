Subject: Re: Tuning at Boston Early Music Festival

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

A fabulous experiece in early music tuning is to hear John Dowland in the
tuning outlined by his son Robert.  Wim Hoogewerf played three works that
were stunning.  The nearest experience for me was listening to J.S. Bach's
Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor in Werckmeister III.

French citizen Wim Hoogewerf was the a featured guitarist this AFMM season
and his individually moveable fretlets alow for many new possibilities.
Following the outlining of the cover of PITCH I:1 (AFMM produced), Wim set
up a tuning for Dowland with certain chords completely just, and with
others in varying shades of delicious support.

All concerts were recorded with most videotaped.  Following this series,
the music hereby amassed will become available, somehow.
