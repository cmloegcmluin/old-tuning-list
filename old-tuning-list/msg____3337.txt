That's right! I thought I was being too obtuse for anyone to get this 
message, but it's true. As usual, the results of an ill-conceived 
matho-musical concept, that of tritave equivalence in this case, are 
musically very interesting even though they do not corroborate the original 
premises of the theory. What I did in my post was take the theory completely 
at face value, and work out its consequences within the framework of the 
faulty premise. The music will have a lot of interesting features as a 
result of the tritave structures, but near-octaves will take on the 
character of equivalence and the effect will be, as Gary pointed out, that 
of entirely new harmonies within each octave span.

Whether this means an increase in harmonic variety, I don't know, because 
(octave) inversions and extensions are very valuable in organizing harmonies 
into coherent progressions. Perhaps it's an increase in variety, but at the 
expense of unity.
