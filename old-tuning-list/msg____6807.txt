Humble thanks to Steve for his wonderful comments on "Acoustic
Stick." It is quite scary to put an album out, because everyone sees it
through their own personal perceptions and expectations, whatever those
may be...if you hit the bullseye, and someone likes it, you can breathe a
bit easier...until the next review.
    As to Danielou, thanks for the comments. A new question, then...how
is Levy's book any different, and is it any more "correct" than Danielou?
Kraig's comments on our European ancestors were right on the money...so,
what does anyone know about Native American music/modes/scales, etc? I
have not heard a lot of Indian music, but it sure sounds different than
most music I've yet heard in this world. The fact is, it IS the music
that is indigenous to this land, but, in true European fashion, we've
totally ignored it, and replaced it with what we brought with us. What
are we missing through our stupidity? I don't yet fully know, but it's a
shame that we have totally dominated a land in a most dishonorable
way...there's a lot we can learn, if we would listen to the winds of this
land...Hstick
