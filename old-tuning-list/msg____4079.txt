Gary :  Would you tell me the T.D. numbers where you mention the "wandering
tonics" ?
---------------------------------------
 
We are at least two the ones who are obsessed. I would like to know how many
other T.D.'fans are also obsessed. That would be very interesting. I suposse
many of them, and it's my desire that exactly all of the members were
obsessed.
 
 And Why ? 
 
Because the unic way to convince the world that ALL MUSIC IS MICROTONAL is to 
get everybody in "resonance", ( and even better without heterodyne sounds
 :)>  ).
 
The "12" is a cultural break for the reality of music.
I believe that everything, or almost everything is ready for this big jump.   
The history of future music will remember that we the Tuning-Lister 
through the magic of e-mail communication were the arrowheads that changed and
replaced the "12" by "Microtonalism".
I always explain to my friends that it's a lie that the foundation of western 
music was 12tET and that piano does not rule the reality or the theory. 
 
In how many different ways can the piano be tuned ? 
-  The answer is very simple - As many times as tuners tune them.
----------------------------------------
 
The next sentence is my Trojan Horse for this topic.
 
 "The 12 notes of the Octave may be denominated in 35 different manners, they
are writen in the pentagram with more than 350 symbols and all of this for at 
least 36 notes-frequency that are used but aren't writen.".!?!?!?
  Then I am the madman ... I say, perhaps not enough, but anyway it helps...
