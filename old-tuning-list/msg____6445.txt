   I agree that there should be no one "main" tuning.  Each tuning ought to
stand for its own merits, and drawbacks of course.

   As for new paradigms though, I think the fact that each tuning presents
new paradigms of composition to be very interesting.  But perhaps that
depends on what you mean by paradigm.  I take the term to mean a set of
bounds that you put yourself into.

   As I've suggested before on the list, I think that systematic
limitations can be valuable rather than detrimental to composers.  For one
thing, if you find limits on the available solutions stiffling, then
systematic limitations at least have the advantage of also limiting the
problems you could run into!

   But more importantly, having a limited scope of solutions doesn't
restrict, but enhances, creativity.  The fact, for example, that 9TET,
Pierce-Bohlen, 88CET, and many other tunings with a fairly large step size,
provide no means of realizing diatonic melody strikes me as a valuable
compositional paradigm to work under.  You have no choice but to break away
from a diatonic mindset completely!  Limitations force you to use
creativity to find a different solution, or a different problem.

   Also, many times when I'm forced to experiment, I accidentally chance
upon something that's even better than what I had in mind in the first
place.

   So I think that pushing a button to get any arbitrary thing you want is
boring.

   The other advantage of composing within a paradigm, is that it can make
the results easier for your audiences to follow.  They may not hear a
diatonic scale for example, but if your melodies outline some
nontraditional scale pattern, they'll get a firm grasp of that
nontraditional pattern.  Avoiding patterns altogether will produce the
effect of randomness.  True, chaos could be a meaningful idea to portray
under some circumstances, but there's also certainly a lot to be said for
giving your audience a crystal-clear image of something unusual and
unexpected.
