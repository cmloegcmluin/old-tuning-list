Subject: No Scales!

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

Yes, I am aware that the 7-limit interval approximations <7LIAs> in the various
>12ETs will require some nth-ET-specific explanations. 
However, I contend from practical composing experience that many, and probably
most, of their tendencies in chromatic, tonal contexts can be described in
general, non-nth-ET-specific ways <although admittedly limited to ETs with
reasonably good 3,5, and 7-limit intervals> .  I should have omitted mention of
JI .

IMPORTANT: I am NOT proposing a way to integrate the 7LIAs into any particular
scale. I believe many xenharmonicists are too obsessed with scales, and the
correlating melodic-harmonic consistency.  Recall those irascible 2nd, 3rd, 6th,
and 7th degrees of the minor scale, and remember how JS Bach, that titan of
tonality, handled them!  In any case, the style contexts I am considering are
those which could be described in their most extreme state as tonal chromaticism
a la Wagner or Richard Strauss.

And, as further defense of my 

anti-monist, heterodox, anti-scale blasphemy,
caused directly by alien implants sewn into me by the
Trilateral Black Helicopter Illuminati of Cuba
<now I doubt any of you can flame me better than that!*>

go listen to one of those improvisers produced by contemporary jazz  education
who never got beyond <play the scale that goes with that chord>, and then go
listen to some Charlie Parker. And yes, I admit it, I love pre-serialism
Stravinsky and the frequently great contrast between his melodic and harmonic
materials.

*let that self-inflicted insult serve as a warning to several brilliant people
on this list who go off the deep end trading insults & innuendo, instead of
trading missiles of xenharmonic knowledge, wisdom, and tolerance!

Insightfully & Incitingly yours,
Harold Fortuin
