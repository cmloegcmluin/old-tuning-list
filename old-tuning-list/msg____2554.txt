I think Larry Solomon's point here was that there wasn't any 
problem with that and thought John Saylor found a problem with 
it. For my part, I think each listener approaches listening 
through his or her own lense, which may include interpretation 
of symbols to some degree or not at all. In the course of this 
thread of symbolism I've realized that I'm more drawn to 
listening to pieces by Cage that don't suggest something beyond 
the music itself (such as string quartets or titles with 
numbers) because I prefer just to hear it than to be burdened 
with the thought that it's *about*somehting because the title 
mentions something like stars, or sounds poetic. But that's just 
my problem and has probably caused me to not listen to a lot of 
good music.
