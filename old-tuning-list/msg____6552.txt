Subject: Re: Bach's Tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Bach was known for tuning everything himself and well within 15 minutes.
Though absolute pitch as evidenced by the gene for "perfect pitch" would
be quite ignored in the era before pitch standards, Bach could well have
worked out the finest distinctions of pitch differentiation.  Most likely
on his favored clavichords.

Perhaps well temperament, with its myriad of tuning relationships, is
a prototype for the polymicrotonality I am composing.  From German city to
German city there were different German tuning preferences in the
baroque period (e.g. Matheson-12ET-Hamburg, Handel-extended
meantone-cosmpolita, Silbermann-sixth-comma meantone-Dresden).  Telemann
proposed a theoretical 5ET so that a circular sixth-comma meantone could
be obtained.

Essentially, Werckmeister III is an archetype for all future well
temperaments.  When Werckmeister wrote in 1691 _Musical Temperament_ he
provided the first description of a "correct" tuning that played in a full
cycle of keys.  Werckmeister first describes a divine just intonation
relationship between tones which is basically unreachable due to the
keyboard manual's arrangement.  Werckmeister I is simple ratio just
intonation.

The second description of a temperament in "incorrect" ("unrichtige")
because it did not allow unrestricted modulation.  Werckmeister
particularly frowns on the technology of split black (or sometime
inversely white) chromatic keys.  Werckmeister II is quarter-comma
meantone.

The largest discussion in _Musical Temperament_ centers on what has come
to be known as "Werckmeister III".  The author didn't name the "good
temperament" but merely described a popular tuning of the middle baroque
in Thuringia and throughout German lands (definitiely including
Danish-speaking Lubeck where Dietrich Buxtehude was an ardant Werckmeister
fan.)  (And of course Bach almost lost employment for just taking off to
Lubeck to see Buxtehude play in person.)

Werckmeister embarrassingly met the charge that 12ET was nowhere to be
found in his privately-produced publication by claiming that the
"engraver" of his monochord drawings refused to draw it!  (This is
described in the New Grove article "temperament."  Though there are
alternate well-temperament arrangements outlined that might now be called
Werckmeister IV, V, and VI, these are given relative short shrift by the
author.  Werckmeister III is the prominent well temperament tuning current
in Bach's Thuringia and is more than half the monograph.

J.S. Bach lived for a number of years with his cousin Johann Walter (an
organist, composer, author of the first major German language music
encyclopedia, and former student of Werckmeister).  Walter would receive
letters and music from his older friend Werckmeister.  Do you think Bach
could ignore the famous Werckmeister?  He couldn't help but tune only to
his own satisfaction, clearly accepting on some level the pronouncements
of Thuringia's leading organ designer and organist of an earlier
generation. If Bach had been equal-tempered he would have
said so. If he was well-tempered, likewise he would say so, and he did.
