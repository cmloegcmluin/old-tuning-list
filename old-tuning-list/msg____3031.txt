Subject: re: Hard to Listen to Partch

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

Hmmm....when I first heard Partch (at about the age of 21),
I'd already heard Sun Ra, Zappa, Capt. Beefheart and Terry 
Riley's Shri Camel, so Partch didn't seem too alien. At the time 
my impression was that he reminded me of Beefheart but his 
voice couldn't compare.

Fast forward to my current interest in tuning and I feel that 
JI is more acessible then an equal temperment any day.

Having written that, I'd note that I didn't make it a point
to investigate Partch in anymore detail until a few years
ago. I guess I had to go through my rock then jazz phase
before I was ready to investigate tuning. :)

Reminder: Newband at Merkin Concert Hall, NY, NY 6/18!
works of Harry Partch, Muhal Richard Abrams (world premiere), 
Dean Drummond and Anne LeBaron.
