   At least among most tuning buffs, "temperament" is pretty much
synonymous with "deviation from just intonation".  And that is to say JI of
whatever sort, although the Ptolemaic tuning of 1:1 9:8 5:4 4:3 3:2 5:3
15:8 2:1 is probably generally regarded as the most basic reference point
for a major scale anyway.

   That is NOT to suggest, however, that Pythagorean tuning (1:1 9:8 81:64
4:3 3:2 27:16 243:128 2:1) is regarded as a temperament of that Ptolemaic
tuning.  Pythagorean is another JI point of reference.

   Meantone temperament is a tuning system based upon a consistent size of
perfect fifth, that fifth being tempered downward to make other intervals
Just, or at least a lot closer to just.  Now in 99% of the cases they
involved a "wolf fifth" at the point where the circle was broken,
frequently between G# and Eb.  That does not violate the
single-size-of-fifth rule, because G# to Eb is clearly a diminished sixth
instead of a P5.

   The system you described above is called "quarter-comma meantone",
because its fifth is tempered flat by a quarter of a syntonic comma (81:80)
so that four of them stacked atop on another, adjusting downward by octaves
as needed, arrives at an exact, just 5:4.  (Zikes!  Please don't say
"perfect third";  fifths can be perfect, but not thirds;  that's what the
word "just" is for.)

   Notice that I said in 99% of the cases it involved a wolf fifth.  There
are historically rare, but well-documented, cases of two meantone systems
being completed by carrying them beyond 12 (or occasionally 13-14) tones
per octave.  The two systems that this works for a third-comma meantone, in
which the fifth is flatted by a third of an 81:80 syntonic comma to produce
a just 5:3 major sixth, and in quarter-comma meantone.

   When 19 third-comma flat fifths are stacked atop one another, you arrive
at a pitch that is astoundingly close to exactly 11 octaves above where you
started - only about 1 cent off!  That means that "complete" third-comma
meantone is so close to 19-tone-per-octave equal-temperament (called
"19TET") that there's no real-world point in distinguishing between the
two.  And the analogous situation occurs with quarter-comma meantone and
31TET.  Christian Huygens and others noticed this during the reign of
quarter-comma meantone.




>4. Bachís WTC refers to a mean tempered clavichord; in particular,
>well-tempered means mean tempered.

   I am personally aware of no evidence of that.  All evidence I've heard
suggests that he wrote it for several of the Werkmeister well temperaments,
which were used by the organs in the area.

   To the best of my knowledge "klavier" conceptually refers to any
keyboard instrument, although it's astoundingly unlikely that it would be
applied to the organ.
