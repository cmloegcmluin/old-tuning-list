Haven't you been listening?  Daniel has several times mentioned the
fact
that many of the organs available to Mozart were in meantone.  Organs
hold their tuning splendidly.

Meanwhile, fretted instruments have used ET almost exclusively
throughout their history, because of the difficulty of frets needing
to
be in different places from one string to the next.

Without  having the actual tuning instructions it might be hard to
tell how the organ was actually tuned.  
	True, organs are supposed to hold their tune for a long time, but I
don't think one that has not been tuned in 200 years would be a
reliable indication of how it was tuned then. Otherwise why would,
for instance, Grace Cathedral in San Francisco employ a full time
organ tuner?   Of course other maintanance is required, but I have
heard tuning a large pipe organ is like painting the Golden Gate
Bridge. Once they finish, they start all over again.
	If there are specific tuning instructions for early organs and
keyboard instruments, I am hoping they might get posted here, or at
least references to where they can be found. 
	The fret spacing is interesting, bits and pieces keep popping up. 
Perhaps there is a book or other resource availble? Or specific
pointers to the archives?
