Increasing the tuning resolution of musical instruments could do
more to accomplish this than dozens of diatribes.

I would prefer to just not have to worry about it, as apparently,
would you, Brian.  We just have different methods of achieving
that end.

By the way, I don't understand how you can quote tuning error
figures for the E-mu chips.  Aren't they wavetable synthesis? 
Did E-mu publish the length of their samples?
