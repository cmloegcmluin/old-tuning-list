You're putting words in my mouth. Let me paraphrase, first "purpose",
then "suggest itself musically".

What I mean by purpose is the association "a pleasant chord". In 12tet, a 
Major 6 9 chord has taken on this association over time just as diminished
chords have taken on the association of "danger". This can happen because
in 12tet a Major 6 9 chord is relatively consonant compared to other
possible structures, even though if you listen closely, it's actually
dissonant. This sort of thing can take place in any limited pitch set, where 
there are only so many possible structures, so that there are no competing 
"better" choices for producing an effect, and so a particular stucture will 
win out. 

In unlimited JI, being an infinite pitch set (infinite yet not
containing all intervals of course), relative dissonance or 
consonance is based directly on the tuning so this ability to "choose 
the lesser of two evils" in creating associations doesn't exist in the 
same way. 

In JI there are many many more-consonant and more-pleasant structures 
than the various approximations of a 12tet Major 6 9 chord.

When people put up examples like this to show me that there's a problem
in JI because, say, a Major 6 9 chord is dissonant in JI, I note that
the problem is in trying to transfer a structure that means something 
in another tuning system into JI and expecting JI's various approximations
of this structure to mean the same thing (have the same association,
especially as compared to other structures available in the system). 

What I meant by "suggest itself musically" is to play around with
the resources in JI (improvise, if you will, on paper or in real time)
to find out what's there, and see what kinds of consonance-dissonance
relations can be found, and what kinds of associations spring up,
and to use these musically--rather than improvise in 12tet and then
try to translate it into JI. To me, a Major 6 9 chord doesn't
"suggest itself musically" in JI, the way it does in 12tet. Other
structures do "suggest themselves musically".

I can't hear it in my head, but I'll bet you're right. I tend n
ot to "believe in" utonal structures at this point in my exploring. 
I mean, I can use them and hear them, just as I can hear and use 
stacks of various arbitrary intervals, but utonality doesn't seem 
to have the same self-organizing "pull" that otonality has even 
though the math would suggest it. I reserve the right to alter my 
position.

This is probably because otonality is easier to establish period! The 
difference tones in otonality tend to support the same otonality. The 
difference tones in utonality tend to disrupt the utonality by producing 
difference tones which would support an otonality instead. 
 
Summation tones would tend to support utonality, but I lean 
towards the camp that holds that these are rarely heard and
are practically unimportant in the natural hearing process.

I've even read that difference tones may be generated internally,
as part of the hearing process itself, so that even listening to
two sine waves in head phones at low levels, we do some 
"otonal"-style internal processing.

After once reading mail from Marshal Tuttle on the Fidonet 
Comp 101 echo (BTW, does anyone know how to access Fidonet via 
internet?) who said that string players tend to tune major thirds as 
pythagorean (81/64) and minor chords 12tet (300 cents), I wanted 
to see what JI interval a 12tet minor third is close to. It turns 
out to be a close match with 19/16 at 297.5 cents; roughly the 
same error as a 3/2 receives in 12tet. Compare this to the generally 
accepted standard JI minor third 6/5 at 315.6 cents. The first-order 
difference tones for 16:19:24 are 3:5:8, making it possible that these 
string players are intuitively aiming for an otonal, not utonal, minor 
chord!

Neat. It would probably work well in the high register, to bring this out.
