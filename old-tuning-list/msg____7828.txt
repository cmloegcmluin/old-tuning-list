Subject: Just Intonation Info-Junction Web Page

From: "Just Intonation" <justintonation@hotmail.com>

Hi, everybody. I got started on my new just intonation web page this 
morning. It's over at:

   http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/4013/justinfo.html

   What I want to do is have more precise links to specific articles, 
software download pages, etc, than are on the Just Intonation Network 
web site, and it will be specifically geared to the newbie without a 
conventional music education background, since that's where I'm coming 
from. If you have any suggestions for links, please let me know by 
private e-mail. Thanks.

   Bill Flavell
