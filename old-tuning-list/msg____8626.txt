Many thanks to Kraig Grady for posting the scanned pages of Wilsoniana.
These are quite valuable to those not familiar with Wilson's Xenharmoniko=
n
articles. I look forward to further additions; those that come immediatel=
y
to mind are the landmark letters to Chalmers and Fokker, the set of
multi-dimensional hexany graphs, the scale tree, the tubulongs in diaphon=
ic
cycles, the instrument patents, and fibbonaci/golden/phi meantone, pelog
and slendro series.
