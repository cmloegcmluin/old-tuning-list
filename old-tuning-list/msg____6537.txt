Werckmeister, Kirnberger, Young, etc.

     Hmmm, I am not sure I understand the "same inside 12 fifths definition",
could I ask for more clarification???
    I would vote to use Well Temperament  to describe the irregular,
circulating, non-restrictive tunings that seemed to have begun with
Werckmiester, and found perfection in the Young.   This is a little looser
definition that what I think Carl has described.
     Jorgensen writes: " they are unrestricticve, circulating temperaments
allowing modulation thorugh all the keys without encountering wolf intervals".
I think that a good definition of well temperament should include the lack of
wolves, However, how shall we define wolf?  anything more than a comma?
Ronnie Milsap,  (who had his other tuner come retune his piano the day after I
introduced him to Mr Young), started calling "wolf" at about 18 cents in the
maj3rd...........
     Also,  Jorgensen writes " the varying sizes of major thirds are placed in
strict order, whereby they change regularly in patterns from smallest to
largest and back to smallest while modulating through a series of fourths or
fifths around the circle. The form of tonality in these irregular temperaments
is , therefore,  regular. "
     This is an important distinction.  Many musicians think the irregular
temperaments just scattered differing levels of dissonance around, willy-
nilly, and you never know what a key might sound like.  In fact, virtually all
of the writings about tunings in the Well Tempered era, ( which I am taking to
be 1700-1850) seem to refer to this form, and it is logical to assume that
composers were using the same basic set of resources in tunings.
      How do I see it?  Meantone forces  black and white decisions on
enharmonic choices, the Well Temperaments  demand a predictable palette of
tempering gradations, ( which I call a "Harmonic Toolbox"),.  and 12 TET
doesn't let you make any choices at all.......
