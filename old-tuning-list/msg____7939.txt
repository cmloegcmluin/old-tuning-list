Subject: Synth Tuning info requested

From: "jloffink" <jloffink@pdq.net>

Dear Tuning List members,

Many of you have visited my web site at http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink . 
At the Microtonal Synthesis Web Site I attempt to list every electronic
instrument capable of user programmable microtonal scales, from theremins
to software synthesizers.  This is no easy task so I am asking your
assistance in filling in the holes on the following instruments.  If you
use any of the following instruments then please help.  In some cases I
need only 1 or 2 parts of the following information, but supplying all of
it would give me a sanity check on what I already have.  The information
requested is:
	# of user programmable octave scales
	# of user programmable full keyboard scales
	scale resolution in cents (or Hertz)
	tuning range per note (in cents or notes)
	scale user interface (digital front panel, sysex, etc.)
	other features (scale utilities, OSs required, etc.)

I also need more information on any models of portable keyboards and
digital pianos with user programmable scales.

Please respond to me directly, not to the list.  Thank you.
