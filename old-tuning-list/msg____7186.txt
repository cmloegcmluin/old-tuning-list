Subject: Tuning and Temperament and Pianovelle 2500

From: rumsong@cadvision.com (Gordon Rumson)

Greetings,

In a moment of rashness I decided to present a Temperament lecture/recital
and to make use of the Baldwin Pianovelle 2500.  I had been informed that
this otherwise fine instrument was easy to program.  Are there any out
there who have used this instrument and might be able offer some
suggestions and advice?

As far as I can tell here is how the instrument operates:

Each pitch of the scale can be altered from Equal Temperament by increments
of 1/64, + or -.

There are two factory presets apart from EQ and two Arabian Scales.  They
give Meantone and Werkmeister.

Here's the set up for the Meantone:

Pitch   Alteration from EQ
C       0
C#      -15
D       -4
D#      +7
E       -9
F       +2
F#      -13
G       -2
G#      -17
A       -7
A#      4
B       -11

Any comments?

I intended to demonstrate the following further temperaments:
(# is the Chapter from Jorgensen's book 'Tuning')

41      J.J. Rousseau's Temperament
47      Handel Well Temperament
56      D'Alembert Modified Meantone
58      Equal Beating D'Alembert Well Temperament
70      The Transposed Vallotti Well Temperament
76      The One Half syntonic Comma Temperament by Kirnberger ca 1771
83      William Hawkings Improved Modified Meantone Temperament of 1807

My hope is to use these and I have come up with some figures using Owen
Jorgensen's text.

All suggestions welcome.

All best wishes,

Gordon Rumson
