Subject: Tuning and psychoacoustics - post 21 of 25

Throughout this series of posts, we have seen that the ear/brain system is not simple.
 Tones," in "The Psychology of Music," ed. Diana Deutsch, 1982, pg. 21]
But the behavior of the ear/brain system is also different from that predicted by Seebeck, Stumpf and Schouten: 
e away the fundamental 440 cps and the second harmonic 880 cps? 
l. 1, No.1, 1955, pg. 55 (English edition, 1957)]
This is the simplest and most compelling example of the contradictory behavior of the ear/brain system.

main and the Seebeck/Stumpf time-domain model of the ear, and instead supports the Fetis/Burns/Ward model of the ear as an adaptive system molded by learned responses.
Thus in one simple experiment we have compelling evidence both for and against all 3 major theories of hearing.
Other compelling evidence for the "contextual" behaviour of the ear/brain system abounds.

"On the hypothesis that critical band filters can be identified with
auditory nerve filters, the model of Zwicker and Scharf was tested by
Pickles (1983). (...) The results agreed with the psychophysical darta, in
that the summed activity increased with stimulus bandwidth, for wider
timulus bandwidths. (Fig. 9.13 B).  However, there was no clear sign
of a flat portion in the function at narrow bandwidths. The reason for
this is not known..." [Pickles, James O., "An Introduction to the Physiology
of Hearing," Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1988, pg. 283]

But by far the most striking gaps in current knowledge of the ear/brain system involve the  question of how the human auditory performs 3-dimensional sound localization. 
TF, or the location of a specific sound using that mathematically-modelled HRTF.

see Appleton, J., "Machine Songs III: Music In the Service of Science--
Science in the Service of Music," Computer Music Journal, 16(3), 1992,
pp. 17-21]
Clearly, there remain many unexplained aspects in the behavior of the ear/brain system.
The next post examines the mass of evidence gleaned from
the many psychoacoustics results confirmed and supported
by a wealth of modern.  Although the modern psychoacoustic
data is complex, it does support some conclusions.  These will
be given in the next post, after which the various biases and
prejudices of the psychoacoustic researchers themselves will
be examined...with an eye to determining how much or how little
their prejudices affected the conclusions each major researcher
drew from hi/r research.
