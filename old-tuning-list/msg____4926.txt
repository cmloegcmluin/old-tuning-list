I'll deal with Eratosthenes first, then Ptolemy.

I was discounting Eratosthenes precisely because of the general view 
that he tried to interpret Aristoxenus's tetrachordal figures in terms 
of string-length proportions. Ptolemy provides us with a version of 
the enharmonic tetrachord from five different theorists, including 
himself (Bk.II, sect.14). Of the four who give ratio descriptions, 
Archytas, Didymus and Ptolemy all agree on 5/4 for the large interval; 
only Eratosthenes differs by giving 19/15 instead. This leaves only 
Aristoxenus, who gives us a large interval of 24 parts (out of 30 for 
the 4/3).

How are we to interpret Aristoxenus in ratio terms? If we call our 
Aristoxenean measure "A", we can use the formula

                exp(Aln(4/3)/30)

and then find the first few convergents of the continued fraction 
expression of the result. In the case of A 24, the third convergent 
is 5/4 (the fourth is 34/27). If this is indeed Aristoxenus's 
interval, then the remaining pyknon of 16/15 is divided equally into 3 
+3 parts. This would yield a tetrachord that is perceptually 
indistinguishable from the enharmonic of Didymus, who is clearly 
aiming for near-equal division of the pyknon (31/30 and 32/31 
descending), while Archytas and Ptolemy both choose to divide the 
pyknon unequally. We have good reason then to identify the enharmonic 
of Aristoxenus with that of Didymus.

What of Eratosthenes then? Let's take him seriously in his own right 
for a moment, rather than as a mere misinterpreter of Aristoxenus. As 
it happens, his ratio of 19/15 is in fact one cent closer to 24 
Aristoxenean units (if they are interpreted as a 30-fold equal 
division of the 4/3). 24 parts is about 398 cents; 5/4 is about 12 
cents smaller, while 19/15 is about 11 cents higher. I have no idea 
how Eratosthenes made his calculation, but clearly he didn't use 
logarithms and convergents, nor could he extract the 30th root of 4/3. 
Nevertheless, 19/15 would seem considerably harder to arrive at for 
lyra and kithara players, and it never reappears except under 
Eratosthenes' name. Given that three out of our four sources for the 
enharmonic agree on 5/4, I would suggest that the balance is in favour 
of this ratio, rather than 5/4.

The only further option is to take 81/64 -- the ditone -- as 
Aristoxenus's intended interval. At this point, I'll confess that I've 
been disingenuous in the above two paragraphs, since I don't believe 
for a moment that Aristoxenus's 30 parts of a 4/3 allow anything like 
such precision. The ditone is in fact Aristoxenus's own _stated_ 
preference for the large interval of the enharmonic tetrachord, and he 
laments that the trend in his time was in favour of a more intense 
tuning, which "sweetened" the ditone (clearly the 5/4 of the other 
theorists -- see El. Harm. 23, 12ff.). For what it's worth, then, how 
close does the ditone come to the cents measurement of 24 parts of 
(4/3)^(1/30) each? The improvement on 19/15 is only one cent more. 
This should give us a good idea of the margins of vagueness and 
precision within which we should Aristoxenus's figures. Archytas was a 
near predecessor of Aristoxenus, or an older contemporary, and he, as 
we have seen, was already content to give 5/4 as the width of the 
large interval, so the trend was already well under way some time 
before Aristoxenus wrote; we might even speculate that Aristoxenus was 
stating his preference for a practice that had died out by the time he 
wrote. Whatever the case may be, Barker argues persuasively that 
neither Aristoxenus nor Archytas convinced themselves of the relative 
sizes of ditone and 5/4 by means of the monochord (a method which 
would hardly have claimed much of Aristoxenus's time!) nor by 
listening alone, but rather by observation: they would have seen 
players tune their string by fourths and fifths to arrive at the 
ditone, after which they would have noticed the players tighten the 
string until the "sweetness" of the interval between that string and 
its higher neighbour satisfied them.

I don't see that there is any more reason to doubt Ptolemy's 
pyknomatic tetrachordal divisions than there is to doubt his kithara 
and lyra tunings. Of course players would not have been able to intuit 
the sizes of Ptolemy's ratios within the pyknon, but nor would they 
have been able to intuit the ratios of any of the other theorists 
either. No, what leads me to believe that Ptolemy's enharmonic and 
chromatic divisions were trustworthy as a description of contemporary 
practice (though perhaps not earlier) is the peculiar and awkard 
method he devises for calculating how the pyknon was to be divided. 
This has nothing to do with the constraint of finding superparticular 
ratios, since the tunings Ptolemy takes issue with -- the enharmonics 
of Archytas, Eratosthenes and Didymus, and the chromatics of 
Eratosthenes and Didymus -- all remain within these constraints (only 
Archytas's chromatic contains an epimeric ratio). Rather, he has 
devised the method to arrive at a result which gives a higher interval 
that is noticeably larger than the lower, indeed, as John Chalmers 
says, about twice as large as the lower interval. He criticises 
Archytas for reversing the order of large and small in both enharmonic 
and chromatic, and Didymus for the same offence in his chromatic. The 
only plausible explanation would seem to be that Ptolemy heard such 
divisions of the pyknon practised by players; his task, based on this 
perception, was to find the method of generating superparticular 
ratios that best reflected this perception.
