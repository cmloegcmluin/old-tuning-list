Bill Alves' classification of modes based upon

''Number of pitches in the tuning system/number of pitches in the
subset/number of commonly used auxiliary tones.''

is very useful, and recalls Wilson's MOS scheme.

However, the first number in the classification applies only to
temperaments. If the diatonic scale is in pythagorean intonation, there is
a convenient MOS at 12, but the number of pitches available through
modulations by fifths in either direction is potentially infinite. The
Javanese modes are similar in that the temperament of the metallophones
settles on 5 or 7 pitches (or pitch areas - as the instruments tend not to
be tuned to exact unison or octaves, which must affect the
''digestability'' (thank you, Klaerentz Barlough) of the temperament), but
this restriction need not be applied to voices and instruments of variable
pitch. I would classify the auxillary tones differently for the Javanese
modes as well with Slendro as 5/4/1 + 4 miring (in between) pitches. I hear
pelog as 7/5/0 with the use of pitches 3 and 4 in pelog nem/lima being
heard as real modulations and the gender bem (which has no key 4) being an
example of idiomatic instrumental realization and not a modal auxillary
pitch (there is something similar in Gagaku when the wind instruments play
''wrong'' pitches when the core melody contains a tone not available on the
instrument). In pelog barang, the use of pitch 1 in place of 7 is similar.

If the first number in the classification can be taken as nominal pitch
areas with exact intonation unspecified, then the Karnatic 72 melakarta
scheme gives 72 modes in the form 12/7/0, or, with the raised ma modes
taken as auxillaries (which does not conform to practice, however) 36 modes
of 12/7/1. Interestingly, consecutive pieces in Karnatic recitals - or
between sections of a single Raga Malaka - often stand at one ''key
signature'' distance from one another thus reinforcing the ''12-ness'' of
the system, and some recitalists like to include one strategic disjunction
in the series (i.e. to a mode two or more accidentals away or to one that
doesn't correspond to a diatonic possibility). Thus you will often hear
Kalyani (with Ma #) next to Sankarabharanam (no sharps or flats). The
subject of the consecutive ragas in a program or within a Raga Malaka seems
not to have received any attention. What have others observed?    

(I should note that the ragas whose pitch content corresponds to our
diatonic modes make up the majority of the ragas found in frequent use, but
students all begin studying the music with the mode s rb g m p db n s -
with two augmented seconds. K.S. Subramanian explained that the augmented
intervals made it more ''unnatural'' and thus more difficult to control,
and so it was considered important to master such a raga first, before
learning those with easier intervals. In fact, however, I found it fairly
easy to sing because the ''difficult pitches'' were all neighbors of tones
in a major triad, which is easy to sing against a drone, and all of the
gamakas (ornaments) reflected this. This made an intonationally interesting
effect however, in that three pitches were well defined as consonant to the
drone, and the remaining were defined by their melodic distance from these
pitches, not by their harmonic consonance or dissonance.
