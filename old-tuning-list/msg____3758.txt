I think the disagreement/agreement between the fundamental bass and the 
actual bass is a very important source of tension/resolution in music by any 
of the composers you mentioned.

Then you must be talking about a type of masking different from that which 
is only a function of pitch proximity. I thought you weren't, which is why I 
pointed out that subharmonic series will, ceteris paribus, lead to more 
masking, due to the ubiquitous combination tones. However, you must be 
talking about a phenomenon related to the virtual pitch phenomenon, wherein 
partials in a harmonic relationship are subsumed into a single perception, 
making the components difficult to hear. This phenomenon is quite easy to 

demonstrate, it is what distinguishes harmonic series harmonies of sine 
waves, and what makes harmonic-series chords easier for the brain to 
understand than subharmonic series chords.

This is because you have defined the string as the lowest possible pitch. 
Clearly a series that proceeds downwards will reach a limit when you have 
this constraint in place, while a series proceeding upwards will not.

But you can always get a longer string to see what 5/4 or 55/4 of the 
original string length sounds like. However, you will eventually reach 
impossibly microscopic string lengths with a harmonic division. This 
argument is going nowhere.

>4) The period (for example, one second) is a function of our notation.

And what isn't?
