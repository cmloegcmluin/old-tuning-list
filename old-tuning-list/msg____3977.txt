Subject: ICMA Web Site

From: muslp@luxor.latrobe.edu.au

The new ICMA website is at

http://music.dartmouth.edu/~icma

and the ICMA is inviting people to contribute links to it, so that is
it can serve as a reference to many other websites which deal with
aspects of computer music. This applies to composers, bulletin boards,
software, organizations, record labels, etc. 

So please, send in your link suggestions, and if you have suggestions about
categories (for instance, should there be a Computer Music/Experimental
Intonation Category?) send them to

leslie.stone@dartmouth.edu

thanks
lp
