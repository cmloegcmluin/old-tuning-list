Rasch addresses this in his paper, which I recommend reading.  He finds
quite a few things wrong with it, but I won't attempt to paraphrase

I think the main thing is that he has cast enough doubt on the issue
that you can, with a clear conscience, please yourself.  You prefer
equal temperament?  No problem.  You like Werckmeister III?  Go for it.
