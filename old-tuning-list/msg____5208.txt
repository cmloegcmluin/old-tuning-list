Oh, I was thinking of things like the existence of particles, time,
conservation of mass/energy, that a repeatable observation has any bearing
on the nature of the universe.  Any axiomatic principle that forms the
basis of scientific observation and experimentation has its existence in
some "mystical" insight, whether acknowledged or "self-evident", IMHO.  

Thanks for your thoughts-they are always thorough and stretch my thinking.
