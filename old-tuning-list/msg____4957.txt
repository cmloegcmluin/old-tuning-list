Do you mean, perhaps, that the major thirds of the tonic triads in E 
and A were closer to 81/64, whereas those in G and Eb were closer to 
5/4? Or something along these lines?

The comparative merits of different tunings systems are relative to 
the music you wish to play in them. 12TET would never have been 
adopted as the normal keyboard tuning if well temperaments were 
thought to be as suitable for Chopin as they were for Bach (I choose 
Chopin because he explicitly demanded 12TET). Likewise, in the early 
18th century, well-temperament would not have been adopted as a 
keyboard norm if meantone temperaments answered all the needs of 
musicians and composers at this time. No tuning is superior 
simpliciter, but only superior (if at all) in relation to a specified 
musical repertoire.

How so? What advantages could any well-temperament possibly offer for 
serial music? Well-temperaments took the form they did because in the 
period 1700-50 "white-notes" keys predominated, and modulations were 
mainly local and not very far reaching, but the exceptions were 
frequent enough for some compromise to be desirable (a compromise not 
available within meantone systems, even given a couple of split keys). 
Thus C major receives good (i.e. 5/4 or close) major thirds, while F# 
major has to make do with near Pythagorean major thirds. 
Well-temperaments were thus designed entirely to cope best with the 
characteristics of the music of this period. Serial music shares none 
of these characteristics; playing it on a well-tempered keyboard is no 
doubt harmless fun, but to make claims that it _ought_ to be played 
thus seem quite baseless.
