Subject: Sixth comma meantone temperament: "per comune opinione perfettissimo"

From: <Ascend11@aol.com>

I've been playing my piano which was retuned from quarter comma meantone=
=0Atemperament to sixth comma MT last week and want to put down some impr=
essions=0Awhile they're fresh.  A year ago, I had my other piano - an old=
er one with a=0Awarm, not bright tone quality retuned from equal temperam=
ent to sixth comma MT=0Atemperament.  As I played that piano over the nex=
t days and weeks, my initial=0Asense of amazement that a piano, of all in=
struments, could sound so pleasingly=0Aharmonious grew even greater.  The=
 change in tuning did wonders for that=0Apiano's overall resonance, givin=
g it an almost awe-inspiring "big" sound.  The=0Afact that I'd never seen=
 or really seriously imagined a "change of heart" in a=0Apiano of this na=
ture before contributed to the overall impression.

Despite the overall reduction in sharpness of the major thirds from about=
 13.5=0Acents to a little over 7 cents (I'm sure there were deviations fr=
om target of=0A1, 2, and even three cents here and there), the sharpness =
of the thirds in=0Asixth comma MT was prominent in its overall sound.  Th=
e harmonies were warmer,=0Abut had a mild "impressionistic" vagueness whi=
ch I associate with 12 TET=0Aharmonies.  I had a desire to hear a piano t=
uned with the sharpness of the=0Athirds reduced even more and later began=
 working with a rented piano tuned for=0Aa brief time to 5/24 comma MT (t=
hirds 3 and a half cents sharp) and then,=0Abecause even in that tuning t=
he sharpness of some of the thirds sometimes drew=0Aattention, quarter co=
mma MT temperament.  The increasing flatness of the=0Afifths which was ne=
eded to get the thirds down to just was so gradual that I=0Adidn't notice=
 it at all until reaching the full quarter comma temperament.

Now, my rented Yamaha upright with a very bright tone quality - capable o=
f=0Asounding loud and harsh - has been retuned in the other direction fro=
m quarter=0Acomma MT to sixth comma MT.  My first impressions of the chan=
ge are a slight=0Asense of disappointment.  To me, overall the piano does=
n't sound quite as=0Asmooth and harmonious as it did in quarter comma.  I=
n fact, it almost sounds=0Aas though it had been put into equal temperame=
nt - but the wolves - with=0Athirds now only 28 cents sharp rather than 4=
0 cents sharp remove any doubt as=0Ato the fact that it's not in equal te=
mperament.

When I play pieces, trying to get them to sound really nice and harmoniou=
s, I=0Afeel some frustration.  Getting a good balance with the melody not=
es clear and=0Athe full harmonies continuously present is more difficult =
- at times upper=0Anotes which are thirds above the root will surge too l=
oud, or else they will=0Abe unexpectedly drowned out by lower notes.  The=
 harmonies overall don't sound=0Aas smooth and pleasant.

However, in one piece - Long, long Ago - which I play with some 7th and 9=
th=0Achords marking important points in the piece - the sixth comma MT pe=
rformances=0Areally sound better and more musical than the quarter comma =
ones.  To me,=0Athere didn't seem to be anything out of place at all in u=
sing a just 5/4 for=0Awhat might be intended as a 9/7 in playing such a c=
hord in quarter comma MT -=0Aafter all, it's a twelve=96note=96per=96octa=
ve instrument.  But these chords have a=0Acertain sweetness and flexible =
musicality in the sixth comma MT - the sense of=0Athe different harmony o=
f the ninth chord as contrasted with that of a major=0Atriad - really com=
ing through - which isn't there in the quarter comma=0Arecordings.  Thus =
it seems that widening a 5/4 third by only 7 cents can make=0Ait a lot ea=
sier to "hear" it as something like a 9/7.  It may be that 12 TET=0Agives=
 this same effect and that for many people who are less put=96off by the=
=0Adissonant (and for most contexts too=96sharp) thirds, the improved "re=
alism" of=0Aseventh and ninth chords in 12 TET outweighs its drawbacks.

There's another thing about the sixth comma MT which distinguishes it cle=
arly=0Afrom both quarter comma MT and 12 TET.  This is the quite noticeab=
le pulsating=0Aeffect, a quakiness or shakiness, which seems to be presen=
t most of the time -=0Aa wa=96wa=96wa=96wa=96wa kind of sound going on wi=
th a pulsation rate of about 2 to 4=0Aor 5 waves per second.  I believe t=
his is an effect of the reinforcement of=0Athe beating of the fifths, whi=
ch are flat by about one part in 480, and the=0Amajor thirds, which are s=
harp by exactly twice that amount - one part in 240.=0AWith the bright po=
werful Yamaha, this pulsating is quite noticeable, but it=0Ahadn't caught=
 my attention (although it was present) with the other piano last=0Asumme=
r.

It is possible - maybe there are writings about this - that one of the=0A=
"fathers" of the piano, Gottfried Silbermann, has his name attached to th=
is=0Atemperament - the Silbermann temperament - because he wanted to give=
 his=0Ainstrument a natural vibrato and could best achieve this effect by=
 this=0Aparticular temperament.  An Italian writer on music described thi=
s temperament=0Aas "temperamento per comune opinione perfettissimo" in a =
work published in=0A1786.

Later today my piano tuner is coming again to put the piano into 12 TET a=
nd=0AI'll have a chance to see if that causes the piano to seem appreciab=
ly=0Adifferent than it does now in sixth comma MT, which now seems to me =
almost=0Alike 12 TET already.  Maybe I should enjoy the short time I have=
 before he=0Acomes!

Just a couple additional observations: The major semitones are wide from =
a=0Ajust 16/15 in quarter comma by 5.4 cents, but they are narrow from 16=
/15 by=0A3.6 cents in sixth comma MT - a difference of 9 cents.  The whol=
e tones are=0Avery slightly wider (by 3.6 cents) in sixth comma MT, and t=
his also affects=0Athe overall impression.=0A
