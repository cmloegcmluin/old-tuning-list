The experiments that Ken Wauchope and I both did (independently) are one
bit of tangential evidence. The problem is that it's hard to come up
with an experimental test of what ratio is implied, acoustically, by a
given interval. But there are mathematical ways of defining such things,
such as which pair of overtones is beating most slowly, etc., and
anything reasonable along those lines will favor something like an
integer-limit rule. Superimposing octave equivalence then brings you
from interger-limits to odd-limits.

No!

I agree that the differences are audible

I agree that you wouldn't want the 7-limit approximations to be too
smooth -- that would take away from the need to resolve. However, the
tritones are not, in any relevant harmonic sense, 5-limit.

Right. I think that the dominant 7th arises because it can be formed
from diatonic scale steps. The diatonic scale admits a wide range of
tunings, and the dominant 7th "works" in virtually all of them. Pinning
its tritone down to some complex ratio has no acoustical relevance. Even
contextual relevance is suspect since the diatonic scale in
common-practice music requires the vanishing of the syntonic comma, so
whatever ratio you give, I can probably give you another one, differing
by 81:80, that has as much contextual meaning.
