(A slightly off-topic rambling rave from John ff....)

I have been reading these posts on emotional response with increasing
personal confusion.  Apart from the most obvious works that evoke
strong emotional responses in me (Brusckner's 9th symphony, and in
particular the climax in the 3rd movement; Tristan and Isolde,
especially Act2; etc) the works that have caused me the largest
response seem totally other to the ones peopel have quoted.  

I remember listening to a Xenakis harpsicord piece based on group
transformations, and the effect of hearing the transformations,
following them as they unfolded, was deeply moving.  I had a similar
response to hearing Xenaki's Ikhoor for the first time.  For the kind
of emotional release that removes all stress, and internal tension,
nothing beats Birtwistle (Earth Dance or Secret Theatre).

I sometimes wonder if there are not two classes of people in this
respect.  The Unknown Public CD no. 08 is all about sensuality, but to
be the majority of the pieces are trite and sentimental.  I like
"spikey" music.  I like discords.  Can one really listen to barbershop
music for more than 5 minutes without feeling sick?

I have had a version of this discussion with a composer friend who was
comparing his music with my attempts.  He asserted that his was
emotional and personal, while mine was mathematical and cold -- he
meant this as a discription rather than a critisism.  My problem is
that to me my music is mathematical and intensely emotional.  It moves
me and excites me; why else would I write it?  Indeed the phrase
"mathematical and cold" seems to me an oxymoron.  When I was a student
my reaction to the Schroder-Bernstein theorem was emotional
excitement.  I would write out the proof for the pleasure of seeing
the result emerge.  I am not suggesting that everyone sees the world
this way; but some of us do.  This does of course beg the question as
to whether I have this response because I am a mathematician (if only
a mediocre one) or whether I am a mathematicaian because I have this
response.

I have a vague memory of some work on tunings or on consonnance which
seemed to divide the population into those who heard the beating and
disliked it, and those who heard the beating and wanted it.

Oh well, back to lurking....
