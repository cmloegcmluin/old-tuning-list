Subject: Improvisation and thoughts

From: "Jo A. Hainline" <hainline@unr.edu>

Niel's comments a few weeks ago got me thinking a little about music
performance.  Although I agree with the idea that microtonal musicians
need to master their "axes" if we are to make any real contribution to the
music of our day, I am not so ready to e mbrace his thoughts on
improvisation.  Although improvisation may be a skill helpful to the
mastery of a particular musical instrument I am not convinced that in
itself it adds anything to ultimate musical expierence.  Nor do I feel
that improvisational s kill leads to more creative musical expression.  In
fact it much more readily falls into the realm of noodling than much of
the so-called Western classical repertoire. 

I suppose it ultimately boils down to a discussion of why we make music in
the first place.  On the surface I suppose it is a livilhood, but this is
only because at some point it fulfills or has fulfilled some deeper need.
Whether enhancing religious or political ceremonies, ancient or modern,
music has and does affect the spiritual nature of humanity.  I believe
this effect can lead either towards that which unifies, enlightens,
liberates and enobles life, in a word, "the Good," or can disintegrate
(which some may also describe as liberation), enthrall and bind, leading
to chaos and Death, in a word, "Evil."  These words have overtones which
some may find disagreeable, but the effect cannot be described in simpler
terms.

Musicians do potentially wield great power and inevitably follow one of
two paths.  Mostly though, we are unconscious, perhaps numbed by the
acoustical pollution our Western civilization creates.  I do not believe
there is a single place in the United States, or Europe for that matter,
were it is possible to experience silence.  I am sure there are very few
who are aware of the effect that airplane and automobile noise has, and
when one can escape from that, the hum of the refridgerator or computer or
the electric lights, even on the tops of mountains the "inaudible"
electromagnetic radio and TV and short wave radiation impinges upon our
psyches--these things affect our music--we can't get away from these
things!--HOW CAN WE EXPERIENCE THE SILENCE FROM WHICH SPRINGS THE MUSIC
OF THE SOUL!!!  It is almost impossible nowadays to even imagine, let
alone experience, the impact of Beethoven's music during his time--it has
driven our civilization for centuries, for better and worse.  It is not
merely a new scale we need--they are as prevalent as christian sects--nor
mastering a musical instrument; technicians abound--witness: 300
applications for 2nd bassoon position in San Franscisco Symphony not too
long ago. 

Music is a musician's quest for truth--no more, no less. As that
expression of truth is able to liberate his soul, so does his music
enlighten and move the world.

Cheers to all in the forthcoming year!
Bruce Kanzelmeyer
