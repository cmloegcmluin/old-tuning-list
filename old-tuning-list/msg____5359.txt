Subject: Syntonic Comma vs. P5

   Well...  Perhaps, but I think that that's not a very meaningful
comparison, for two reasons:
1.  A syntonic comma is a description of a pitch discrepancy between two
    different formulations of what are conceptually (12-tone framework) the
    same pitch, whereas a perfect fifth is a basic consonance.  Those are two
    very different concepts, with very different purposes behind them.
2.  22TET's analogy to a syntonic comma is more than two and a half times the
    size of an 81:80, whereas the most extreme intervals likely to be charac-
    terized as perfect fifth are unlikely to deviate from 3:2 by more than
    20c, a difference of barely over 1%.
