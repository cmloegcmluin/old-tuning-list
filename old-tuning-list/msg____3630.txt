I had the same experience with JI Calc on my Power Mac, so a couple of weeks
ago I rewrote the external commands to access the Mac internal software
synthesizer (QuickTime Musical Instruments) and do microtones by pitch bend,
MIDI-style.  Since QT has 1536/octave increments of pitch bend discrimination,
that means intervals will be at most 0.4 cents off.  (I don't know how that
compares to the precision of the original.)  One advantage is that you can
call up any of the QT synthesizer voices (reed organ, sawtooth, etc) and
try out a wider range of harmonic content; but then again, I've noticed 
that in at least one of the QT voices (trumpet) some of the samples are up to
10 cents out of tune to begin with, so even a plain octave beats slightly.  
Overall though, the results sound very good to my ear.

I'll post the code to my web site shortly (where you can also find some of
my MIDI tuning experiments, ranging from Ivor Darreg to do-wop).  Send me 
email if you're interested in the JI Calc code and I'll let you know when 
it's available.
