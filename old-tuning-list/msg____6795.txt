Happy Holidays and New Year to all you tuners.  Check out the January
issue of Whole Earth Magazine for an article of mine on The Microtonal
Way, with both CD and book reviews.

Yes, the Surogate Kithara was an awful sounding instrument as it sprang
out of the instrumentarium of Partch.  After Dean Drummond debuted at the
old Bang on a Can site in the East Village on E. 2nd with U.S. Highball, I
had the chance to really tell something about the qualities of the
instruments themselves.

Dean and I spoke on the telephone following the performance(s) and I was
asked specifically with instruments would do well to be rebuilt and my 2
choices each were rebuilt.  I had recommended Scott Hackelman (LA) for the
S.Kithara and he did indeed succeed, but I don't know who built the new
majestic looking chromelodion.

Hey, they listed my Microtonal Bach Christmas Radio Show in The New York
Times.  Everything is good!  Remember that each snowflake is tuned
differently. :)
