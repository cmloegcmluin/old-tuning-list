Subject: Pusey's XH WEB pages

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

I browsed John Pusey's new Xenharmonikon WEB pages and I must say
they look great even with Lynx rather than Netscape or Mosaic.
In addition to TOC's and both author and title indices, there
are links to Frog Peak Music and the Just Intonation Network
pages. Thanks, John.
 
 
Now for something completely different: Does anyone have Leta Miller's 
email address at UCSC? I've misplaced it and owe her an answer to 
a recent message.
