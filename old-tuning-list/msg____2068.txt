Remember that Sorge's were *ear tuning* instructions.  Because
frequency doubles with every octave, the beating of any fixed interval
*increases* as the frequency of the lower tone of the pair increases.  Although
Sorge's major thirds remain the same size linearly speaking, they would
beat faster with each successive third of the row, hence Sorge's
instructions to make each of the thirds a little wider than the last.

I was merely pointing out that there is a difference between 1/12 of a
Ditonic Comma and the schisma.  For all intents and purposes (thank you,
Michael), they are the same thing and difference between them is
imperceptible in actual tuning... even to your dog.
