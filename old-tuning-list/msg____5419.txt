Subject: JI vs. x-TET

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

As long as the terms of reference are just intervals, the choice between JI
and a given ET will be largely decided by the economy of the mapping from
an (open) just lattice onto the closed ET.  (This is deeply connected to
the whole ''pun'' phenomenon).

While each temperament does provide a unique range of distictive intervals,
the nature of their distinctiveness - as found in beating rates, difference
tones, etc. - has been a relatively neglected subject. While one can only
speculate about how such a subject will ultimately get integrated into a
''common'' musical practice and theory, my own guess is that just intervals
- not a given temperament - will remain the main point of reference and
that such distinctive intervals will continue to be primarily construed as
deviations from just intervals rather than members of a given temperament. 

That said, ETs will continue to play a role in the design of keyboards and
notations - indeed wherever a finite set of placeholders will be efficient
for composition and performance.
