Subject: 10 smart ideas in late 
 20th century music theory
---
Everybody knows that  the most important
composers and music theorists are those
who influence the largest number of
people.
Everybody knows this, and it's wrong.
The rock group KISS influenced far more people
than any avant-garde theorist or composer. Should
we devote a chapter of every modern music textbook
to KISS?
I propose a different (and more sensible) definition of
"influential."
If a dumb fad influences 500 composers to write 
rotten music, the idea is NOT influential.  It's a craze,
like pogs, or hula hoops, or pet rocks. 
And it has no importance.
But if a smart idea influences 5 composers to write
excellent music, then the idea IS influential.  And it
has *vast* importance.
As I've mentioned before, Tops 40s corporate rock and
the avant garde are evil twins. They both use identical
means of promotion: hoopla, ballyhoo, shock-value stunts
and the cult of personality. They both use identical means of
measuring a composer's importance: SHEER QUANTITY.
If rock star X sells 8 squillion CDs, he's a "genius" and
a "brilliant composer."  If avant garde music theorist
X inveigles 50,000 gullible students to spew out
reams of bad music derivative of the latest craze,
he's a "genius" and a "brilliant composer."
Obviously, a new definition of "influential composer"
is required.
Now, what this has to do with microtonality is obvious:
the two most influential (as opposed to faddish) composers
of the second half of the 20th century are clearly Conlon
Nancarrow and Harry Partch. 
Neither of these guys were on the cognitive elite's TOP
TEN charts during the 50s or 60s.  On the contrary. As
Joel Mandelbaum has pointed out, "It is a matter of
everlasting shame that the musical establishment
gave Harry Partch the back of the hand treatment."
This alone should give all music students
pause.   
When you read the conventional history texts of 20th
century music, ask yourself: Why isn't microtonality 
mentioned?  And why isn't music by "the big names" of
the post-1950s played any longer? 
The answers to these questions are connected.
And they can be found in the following list of the 10 
best ideas of post-1950 music theory:
---------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #1:
Joseph Yasser pointed out in his 1938 book "Theory
Of Evolving Tonality" that musical tunings change
with time.  Intonation fashionable in one era becomes
unfashionable in another.
Any composer who, in the 1940s or 1950s, had read
Yasser's book would have realized that serialism was
just another fad...neither better nor worse than
Venetian antiphonal brass choirs, Baroque quodlibet,
or late Medieval mensuration canons.  Yasser's realization 
that tunings are not static, and that musical cultures
influence one anther and tend to blend and intermingle
over time, is a lesson that STILL hasn't been absorbed 
by the writers of conventional music theory texts.
---------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #2:
Harry Partch proposed abandoning the conventional
12 tones. Instead, he built his own instruments
and trained his own performers.  It doesn't much
matter what you abandon those 12 tones for...
just intonation?  Non-12 equal temperaments?
The original tunings of Dowland and Byrd and Bach?  
Non-just non-equal-tempered scales?
The crucial decision is to kick over the chess board
by building your own instruments.  This alone
changes the rules of the conservatory-and-concert-
hall con game.
The fact of the matter is that Partch's decision to
step on the 12-tone anthill breathed much-needed
life into post-1950s music... And the existence of
this tuning forum is testimony to the continuing
power of that idea.
--------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #3:
Jean-Claude Risset's idea (following John Pierce's
and Max Mathews' 1966 & 1969 papers, & later taken 
up by John Chowning, James Dashow, William Sethares
 and most recently Parncutt and Strasburg in the 
1995 PNM article  "'Harmonic'  Progressions of 
Inharmonic Tones") of basing non-12-tone methods 
of tonal and timbral organization on the findings 
of modern psychoacoustics  was a brilliant one.  
It has consistently led to beautiful music.
-----------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #4:
Erv Wilson's notion of augmenting with permutation
techniques the conventional Partchian organization 
by harmonic and subharmonic series (viz., the tonality 
diamond).   Erv's technique offers a more tonally
efficient  alternative to Partch's tonality diamond, 
and it has proven  exceptionally useful to just intonation  
composers.  
As Kraig Grady wrote in 1/1, "With the introduction 
of Erv Wilson's combination product set, Just intonation 
took a giant leap forward." [Grady, K., "Erv Wilson's 
Hexany," 1/1,  7(1), 1991, pp. 8-11.]
If anyone needs further proof, Warren Burt's superb 
composition "Vingt Enflures Sur L'Enfant Melvin" is
a vivid demonstration of the musical value of Erv's ideas.
----------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #5:
Fokker's introduction of ratio space has influenced
generations of composers to produce interesting
and impressive music.  The idea has been extended by
Tenney, Polansky, Johnston, Chalmers, Scholz and
many others. One of the very best po-mo xenharmonic
compositions, "Lattice [2237]" by Carter Scholz, would
be impossible without Fokker's original organizing
principle.
----------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #7:
Lou Harrison's notion that all music students should
be trained in at least one other culture's musical
traditions.  If this were done, it would end at one
stroke the onanistic over-theorizing, the bizarre
yearning to convert music into a species of 
mathematics... Yes, it might even straighten out the 
tortuous verbiage that has made a bottomless 
chum bucket of 12-tone  music theory.
Lou's idea is a brilliant one, long overdue.
When will someone put it into practice?
----------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #8:
Ben Johnston's idea of training conventional performers
in non-12 techniques.  Just as dinosaurs turned into
birds, the smart post-Webern serialists turned into 
extended JI composers working with conventional
performers.  If Webern had lived, he'd obviously have
given up 12 by 1950 at the latest.
-----------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #9:
Max Mathews did what all geniuses do when he
applied the computer to music:  something
that at first looked bizarre, then  became
blindingly obvious, and finally seemed inevitable.  
With its binary precision and enormous speed,
the computer was and is an ideal musical
instrument.  Max Mathews gave a huge impetus
to 20th century composition in general (and non-
12 composition in particular) by writing the
first acoustic compiler.
------------------------------------------
SMART IDEA #10:
Ivor Darreg pointed out in 1975 that every kind tuning
has its own "sound" or "mood" or "sonic fingerprint."
Choosing the "sound" of a composition by choosing
the tuning has proven an endlessly productive idea,
and inspired a wide variety of xenharmonic
composers.
------------------------------------------
It's worth noting that every one of these post-1950
ideas is inherently xenharmonic.  That ought to tell
us something about the direction of the vital 
currents of late 20th century music...
Attention, music students!  How about asking your
professors why THESE ideas aren't mentioned in
your textbooks?
