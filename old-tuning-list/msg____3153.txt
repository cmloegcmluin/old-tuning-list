From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

An erudite Ohio bassist, student of La Monte Young, once cleared up the 
difference between blues and jazz.  Jazz involves the bending of notes 
from agreed upon positions (you know, the 12-ET grid).

Blues, however, involves organic microtones - or "blue" notes - which 
have their own distinct character and role in the blues scale (perhaps 
better described as a mode).  The blue notes can also be bent for 
expressive reasons, but they are centered differently in the mind.
