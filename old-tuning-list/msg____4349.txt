Subject: Re: Interstylisticism

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

As lurkers continue to delurk and we begin to review each other's music,
it seems increasingly important to consider interstylisticism versus style
preferences.  

Travelling to make music in different cities often reveal certain
preferences in their compositional styles.  This is not unlike Wessleyan
ethnomusicology flexing performance, while Colubia University considers
only anthropology.  

The American Festival of Microtonal Music has always been interstylistic,
which is synonymous with tolerant, open, and eclectic.  There has never
been any reason to change the programming though I admit it is difficult
to ascertain one's objectivity on musical styles.

A few questions:  

	Do you consider impovisation inferior or superior to planned 
	composition?

	Do you have a favoirite music?  A music you detest?

	How do deal with music that has an audience but which simply does 
	not move you personally? 

	
When programming I try to recognize styles of music that have an
enthusiastic audience and seek out what accounts for the fascination.
It's always there to be found.  I remember a time when I didn't get jazz.
And Brahms was a bore.

Now I have learned to dig the color of sound, along with the nuances that
make for a Giacinto Scelsi or a La Monte Young.

Oh, yeah, I still prefer Eric Dolphy to Dizzy Gillespie, but we're only
human.  We come in many different varieties and flavors.  I still don't
like drinking beer.

There will never be laws or degrees that determine accomplishment in music
creation that are just.  Anyone and everyone should be encouraged to
express themselves in music.  There are no guarantees.

>From a proffessional point-of-view there are different expectations.  From
a playing point of view there can be a virtuosity that can be put in
reserve and appear even nonchalant.

>From a composer or improvisor there much value is based on the likelihood
of repeated listeners in a a release and initial buys.  And yet truly
original music is almost by definition unlike any thing previously
experienced.  Sometimes they use unique instruments and are based on
completely different philosophies and aesthetics, or in the case of
politics (e.g. luigi nono).
