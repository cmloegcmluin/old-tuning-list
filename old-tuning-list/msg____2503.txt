Subject: Wilson's CPS

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

I need to correct a misapprehension that I am the co-discoverer
of Wilson's CPS. This is not the case; Erv did it all by himself.
I think the confusion stems from a joint paper we published in the
ICMC proceedings back in 1981 (at NTSU) on our computer projects at 
UCSD in the late 60's, though the paper makes it clear that they
were Erv's alone. 
	Erv's discovery of the CPS came about as he pondered the best 
set of pitch bases for a large table of ratios I was compiling. As we 
were becoming limited by the great length of the table, Erv observed we 
could obtain extra "complexity" (more composite intervals and longer 
chains of 5ths, 3rds, etc.) by transposing the whole list to various 
pitches related by well-chosen ratios. This turned out to be a very 
efficient procedure as we had to print out the results on wide computer 
paper anyway and it cost us essentially nothing to add the extra columns 
when we printed the list off a tape.
 
I didn't mean to imply that the XH12 paper was the only place where
Erv Wilson's theories have been published, but it is the most complete 
and easily accessible source. Other issues of XH have articles by Erv 
or his student Kraig Grady and Paul mentioned his article on the 14-tone 
stellated 1.3.5.7 hexany. (BTW, Paul, Erv said he likes your setting of 
the Hildegarde of Bingen text very much.) The Tables of Contents of all 
issues of XH are available at John Pusey's WEB site whose URL is
