Subject: repeating patterns

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

Here's something I've wanted to try, maybe someone already has. Suppose I
took two 12TET scales separated by 80/81. Then one would have both nice
sounding thirds and a wide open modulation horizon.

One idea I had for a keyboard setup was to use the left hand on one 12TET and
the right hand on the other. Then to play a simple diatonic scale one might
have a pattern like RRLRRLLR.

Equal tempered scales have the property that each note has the same set of
intervals available. With other scales, notes will fall into some set of
classes based on what precise intervals are available. Most non-ET scales
repeat on an octave cycle, so a typical 12 note per octave scale would have
12 distinct classes of notes.

The scale I propose above would have 24 notes per octave, but break into just
two classes.

Conventional ET is not the only system with interval symmetry. One can have
multiple generating intervals instead of just one. For example if one takes
the set of pitches (2**n)(3**m) then every note has the same intervals
available.

If I understand how the "k-limit" term is used, it might be useful to make a
finer distinction. Suppose I take a set of notes (2**n)(3**m)(5**p) where n
and m are unbounded but p is constrained to be 0 or 1. My understanding is
that this scale would be called 5-limit. The scale where p is also allowed
unbounded values would also be 5-limit. Perhaps the case of unbounded
exponents is not of sufficient interest to merit a new term?
