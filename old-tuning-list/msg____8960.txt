Hi Dave,

Thanks for repairing the list.

I don't know of another server to move to, but I'd be willing to try
maintaining it at its current location at Mills.  Here's some issues:

1)  Can the list be maintained remotely (e.g., via telnet from Los Angeles)?

2)  Is the TUNING list the only list in jeopardy, or are there a bunch of
lists, at listproc@eartha.mills.edu, that need to be moved?

3)  There'd be some learning curve involved (I've been away from Unix, doing
mostly IBM Mainframe stuff these days.)

That's all I have for now.  Thanks again,
