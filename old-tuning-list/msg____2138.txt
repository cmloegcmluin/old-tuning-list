Subject: Re: RE 88CET

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I don't think that John nor I interpreted Marion's comment as disparaging to
my 88CET compositions or postings.  

   John's point I think was that there's certainly no requirement to learn the
content of my 88CET postings before exploring 88CET.  I think John got the
impression that Marion viewed my 88CET postings as prerequisite reading.  John
sees my postings - appropriately I'd say - as potentially useful hints for his
own future exploration.  I think he just wanted to make sure that nobody got the
wrong impression in that regard.  

   I'll resist the temptation to launch into a big philosophical discussion and
just say that I definitely admire the sheer volume of exploration Marion has
done.  Playing (literally and figuratively) a large field of tunings is every
bit as important as exploring one in great detail as I'm currently doing with
88CET.  

   (By the way, I've written and recorded about 50 minutes of 88CET compositions
thus far, excluding musically mundane experiments in voice-leading and such.
But one 8-minute composition of those 50 minutes probably won't appear on the
CD, so I guess the rest comes to about half a CD's worth or thereabouts.)
