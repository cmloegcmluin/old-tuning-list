At last, some hard data!  Some problems, though ...

Does this mean you're using FFT windows much smaller than 0.7s?
I think these values must be experimental artifacts.  Try analysing
a sawtooth wave with equivalent vibrato and tremolo to calibrate
the uncertainty.  Use an analog synth if you can.


I mentioned this business with conical tubes to show that there is
a quantifiable physical origin for inharmonicity.  The periodicity
of the sounds presumably defaults to the player's ability to
blow a raspberry.  Does this mean the resulting overtone series
is constructed from undertones of the original vibration?  I think
a slide trombone must be pretty near cylindrical, so analysis of a
French horn or something would be more useful.
