Subject: Choosing a synthesizer

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

The December 1995 issue of Keyboard is a hardware buyer's guide.
The overview of synthesizers and tone modules that are most current
nowadays has an item "tuning tables". Of some, the tuning resolution 
is listed but not all. It does say what the range of tuning is for
a key, usually full range or a whole or half semitone less or more.
