Subject:  sorry for the nonsense

From:  bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu

Haverstick here...I want to apologize for the exchange between Mr.
Beardsley and myself...I make it a point never to reply to nasty posts
because it is only inflammatory, but the amout of venom directed my way
from this feller truly astounded me...to have someone who's never met
you dislike you so intensely is rather unsettling...and I am a pretty
loveable sort, truth be known...I will take no more forum space on this
issue (or, non issue)...Hstick
