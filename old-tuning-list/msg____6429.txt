Subject: Update and correction re Cheap Xen Keyboard

From: Steven  Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov>

After having several other things get in the way, I finally got to
finish my 22TET-oriented keyboard yesterday.  It's now 100% complete,
and all buttoned up, but I ran into a snag or two that I want to pass
on as as an addendum.

One correction to my previous article:  The "C & E" 2 key subassemblies
*are* the ones I used (along with a single key (D?) to build the
white keys up, with one exception noted below.  [Should have labelled
the piles "use" and "don't" I guess. :-) ]

After getting the "metalwork" [trimming the little tabs on the key
frame] taken care of, and proceeding to tighten everything down, I
found that the "slop" caused by the slightly non-uniform spacing of
the key mechanism when laid out for 12, necessitated a minor design
change at one end of the keyboard, and a little whittling of a couple
of keys to allow them to move freely.  No big deal, but it did add
some additional trips to the workshop.  The design change involved
using a "G-B" 2 key assembly on the end where the full width C-key is.
I also had to redrill a couple of mounting holes in the assemblies to
accomodate the realignment.

So, "how does it work?"...

Well, not being a keyboard player, I can't be too much of a judge, but
overall it is at least as playable to these fingers as it was before I
put it under the knife.  The resistance of the keys is somewhat
uneven, which would probably bother the more skilled among you, but
we're talking low end plastic here -- I don't expect too much,
especially from a "proof of concept" piece.  The resistance issue
could probably have been solved by pulling and rearranging the little
plunger switches, but I didn't go that far this time around.

As it was, I had to fiddle with one problematic key/plunger
combination to make it work correctly.  I was getting multiple
triggers from that key (it would be neat if there was a switch to make
that happen instrument wide).  As it turned out, the realignment
coupled with that particular membranes physical disposition was just
enough to cause some kind of bounce.  THe problem was solved by
removing the problematic keygroup and one of its neighbors, doing a
bit more whittling, and then reassembling with the unit ON and hooked
up.  I twisted and torqued things until it all worked, and then
tightened up.

So far, so good.  Now all I have to do is learn to play the thing. :-)
As Paul noted earlier, the stretch is still pretty wide, but at least
now I can span a "3/2" (13o22) with one hand.
