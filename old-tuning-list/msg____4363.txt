Brian brings up some good points about the practicality of using a large
number of pitches per octave. As I don't usually use more than 12 pitches
per octave myself (nor a seven octave range, for that matter), I'm not in a
position to offer an experienced perspective on most of these issues.
However, there is one of his assertions I would like to respond to:

Well, I can't speak for other composers, but I don't find using SMPTE that
arduous. It sure beats the heck out of FSK or other multitrack sync systems
in use before SMPTE became widely available. And, yes, I wrote a piece in
which I increased the number of available pitches per octave by
multitracking (using FSK no less). It was on the Synclavier, which would
only allow 12 just pitches per octave, and I needed 13. Since I was already
multitracking the piece, it wasn't a big deal to me, and the process was
made easier in that different parts of the piece used different tuning
system subsets.

I admit it would have been more difficult had I been trying to use a large
number of pitches per octave all in a single melody, but sequencers have
made this kind of note-to-note slight of hand accessible, if not
falling-down simple.

Is the process "harrowing" and "arduous"? Well, I guess that depends on the
music, the person, and the equipment, but I don't think it approaches the
difficulties of building your own instruments.
