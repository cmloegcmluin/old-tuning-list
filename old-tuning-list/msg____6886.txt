Phonons are the quanta of the normal vibrational modes of a crystaline
lattice. If you were immersed in a crystaline lattice (didn't this happen
on Star Trek?) the displacement of ensembles of molecules (a lattice
wave) would correspond to sound, and if you were another molecule in that
lattice, your interaction with the phonon would quantized. Thus molecules
experience quantized 'musical pitches'. Just as relativistic effects are
only noticable at incredibly high velocities, quantization of frequency
is only noticable at very high frequency and/or small scale. Our ears,
capable of hearing, at best, a 66 cent pitch difference ;-), would never
be able to detect quantum effects. Phonons can be thought of as
particles of fixed energy and momentum that move with the
ensemble velocity of the lattice wave (they also work in
continuous media calculations). Using the idea of a particle with
these properties, one finds that phonons interact in
many ways like the particles we use to imagine thermodynamic physical
process, and thus are a convenient mathematical fiction, like photons,
electrons, etc. for describing measured phenomena.
