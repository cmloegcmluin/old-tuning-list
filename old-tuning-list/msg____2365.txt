Subject: 19 in Denver

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick here...last nite (Dec.5) in Denver at the Source theater, the
Colorado Symphony sponsored a concert called "Bending the Boundaries,
which featured local composers performing their new works in various
genres. I was fortunate and honored to be on the bill, and I got to do a
19/oct solo piece ("The Spider"). Attendance was probably 130, and the
response to the whole concert was very good, including a nice review in
the Rocky Mt. News today. The concert was organized by composer in
residence Jon Deak, who plays bass with the NY Phil.
    Once again, Denver proves to be a pretty open minded place for moi,
as 19/oct and the subject of "microtonality" in general are being
accepted by all sorts of folks. The crowd at the gig was very diverse,
and all there seemed to genuinely enjoy the music. Just wanted to let
people know...Hstick
