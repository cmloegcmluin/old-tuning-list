Subject: Re: 88CET Demo Again

From: linusliu@hk.super.net (Linus Liu)

Hello Gary,

I would like to have a copy of your demo.

I think not so many will ask from you since not many will have a DAT! BTW,
I bought a DAT also because I want to record some demo of my tuning. What
a coincidence. When I get it ready shall I give you a copy?

Anyway, my address to mail the tape is:

16 RN-10,
Fairview Park,
Yuen Long,
Hong Kong.

Do I need to pay you anything plus postage? Thanks for all the post card
and lists, etc you've been sending to me too. Must have cost you a lot of
money, and time.

Oh, or are you sending out cassettes, not DAT? I don't mind.

Regards and thanks again,
Linus Liu.
