Subject: new JI Calc version

From: Carter Scholz <csz@well.com>

Version 4.4 of JI Calc is now available at:
ftp://mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/mac/jicalc44.sea.hqx

JI Calc is a Hypercard stack for creating and archiving musical
tunings, especially in just intonation.  It provides MIDI transfer
of tuning data to instruments that support alternative tunings,
specifically Yamaha DX-, TX-, and SY- units, the Emu Proteus series,
the Ensoniq EPS series, and the MIDI Tuning Spec.  It also plays
up to 8 simultaneous tones using Macintosh local sound.

This stack requires Hypercard 2.0 or higher.  Sound on PowerMacs
requires QuickTime 2.0 or higher and QuickTime Musical Instruments.

JI Calc 4.4 changes (1/1/97)
New features:
- Single version for PowerMacs and 680x0s.  Checks for QuickTime
  and Sound Manager; uses them if present, falls back to older
  Sound Driver routines if absent.
- "Lattice" card draws diagrams of tunings.
- String length and fret position calculations for all tunings.
  (Thanks to Steve Curtin and John Chalmers.)
- "Help" stack is now identified with JI Calc version number.
- Holding "shift" while clicking Clear clears only the lower part
  of each ratio field (results of calculations).
- Ear training feature no longer repeats an interval twice in a row.
- Write and Read functions use standard file dialogs.
Fixes:
- Slower MIDI transfers to avoid problems with some fast PowerMacs
  and some synths.  Failure to transmit SY-77/99 tuning names fixed.
- Cosmetic changes to interface, incorporating Steve Curtin's "fret pos"
  and John Chalmers's "string len" buttons.
- Write and Read bugs fixed.
