Subject: forum CD liner notes

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Hate to say it, guys, but my computer is not the best, and my printer 
has just developed some serious problems as well. So, if you were going 
to post your liner notes by email for me to download, it is not going to 
happen. However, John Starrett has graciously said that you can send him 
the info, and he will pass it onto me...his address is: 
jstarret@math.cu.denver.edu   If possible, send info soon as I want to 
get this organized in the near future...we're actually getting 
closer..see you...Hstick
PS...Foote's accidental post about trolls was appreciated..this list is 
usually very peaceful; occasionally a personal dig surfaces, and it 
always says more about the digger than the digee...no need for personal 
attacks...HHH
