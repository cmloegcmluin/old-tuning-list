The first quoted phrase is true and sensible.  There is no need, however,
to hold out via the final sentence.  Astrology is mumbo-jumbo, it has nothing
to do with any reality:  science, music, our tunings, etc.  The ancient
attempts at detecting a true Music of the Spheres was flawed due to its
basic assumptions, which were based on fabled common belief rather than
demonstrated proof of reality.
