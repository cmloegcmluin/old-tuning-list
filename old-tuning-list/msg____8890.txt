A graphic method of determining propriety, no matter how many unique
interior intervals a scale has (Chalmers' formula only works for two) is to
construct its "interval matrix".  This is just its Lambdoma or Tonality
Diamond.

To make a "rank-order matrix", take this diamond and replace each
interval's logarithmic magnitude with a number ranking it's size relative
to all the other intervals in the diamond.  Thus, any subset of an equal
temperament that uses all the intervals in the temperament will have
identical interval and rank-order matrices.  Example: diatonic scale in 12tET.

This idea is that several scales, each having a different interval matrix,
may all be percieved as re-tunings of eachother if they share the same
rank-order matrix.  This works for meantone scales, so far as I can figure.
 What's a Keenan-type scale?

Isn't it amazing how many definitions the word "interval" has?  Here, I
meant a (number of scale steps, acoustic magnitude) pair.  So no, the usual
diatonic is not an example; the tritone is not a type of fifth in the
natural minor.

Let's take a look at its "interval matrix"...
 
      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)
2nds   2    2    2    2   *4       
3rds  *4   *4   *4   *6   *6 
4ths  *6   *6   *8   *8   *8
5ths  *8   10   10   10   10

And rank-order matrix...

      (C)  (D)  (E) (F#) (G#)
2nds   1    1    1    1   *2       
3rds  *2   *2   *2   *3   *3 
4ths  *3   *3   *4   *4   *4
5ths  *4    5    5    5    5

Modes are the columns, interval classes the rows.  Ambiguous intervals are
marked by stars.  My questions are then: 1. Can a scale exist that has one
and only one star in each column?  2. Can a scale exist that has one and
only one star in each row?

Aside from being fun, I think these are useful questions.  For me,
ambiguous intervals are the common tones of a type of "melodic modulation".
 You don't want too many or too few.  In fact, I think I care more about
ambiguous intervals than I do contradictory ones.
