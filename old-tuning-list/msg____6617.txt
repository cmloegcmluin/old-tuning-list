Alas, the incommensurability of the thirds and fifths in 22-tone equal
does not arise only when modulation is employed, which I have always
been very careful to note. If, taking C as tonic, we tune by fifths of
709 cents, we have a G of 709 cents and a B of 1145 cents. These two
intervals form a 'major third' of 436 cents. 22-tone equal melody is a
tissue of such badly, indeed unrecognizably mistuned consonances. To
pretend that Indian singers use major thirds of 436 cents is
contradicted by all the studies I have seen. They may well use an
interval between the major third and perfect fourth for purposes of
ornament, but certainly not as the usual diatonic interval.

The idea that a static scale ? la just intonation can be employed
melodically so long as one does not modulate, fails to understand that
it is not only in modulation that commensurable consonance is necessary;
the very tissue of melody itself falls apart unless the consonances are
conciliated by temperament. 22-tone equal does not do this, which is one
reason why it is such a poor system.
