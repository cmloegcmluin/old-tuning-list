Subject: this and that

From: neil.haverstick@csst.com (Neil Haverstick)

Haverstick here...first of all, there is a truly stupid review of Easley
Blackwood's "Microtonal" CD in the April edition of Musician mag...I
really like this mag, so I suspect they are a bit out of their element
here...I plan to email them to protest...second, Paul Fly's recent post
was great, and, as always, got me to thinking about why I do the things
I do with "microtones"...my goal, from the start, was (is) to make other
tuning systems viable for anyone, and I believe that it is
working...recently, my band and I have done a series of school concerts,
starting with blues and jazz, and finishing with 19 tone original
music...the local Musician's Union is the sponsor, and the union rep
heard our show and loved it (he also came to, and dug,
Microstock)...also, this weekend we are playing a local yuppie hotspot,
and we will do a set of 19 tone stuff in our show...the manager likes
us, I've been told, because we are just a bit different, but we keep
people interested, and they buy beer (or something like that)...anyway,
we are forging ahead, and making other tuning systems part of our
everyday musical life here in Denver, and folks are very interested and
curious...my next CD is in the works as well, and will be much broader
based than the first, as it will have two 34/oct pieces as well as 19
and 12, and will contain compositions that are far removed from the
bluesy rock of "The Gate"...Hstick
