HI Bill:
When you write about Partch:
>> Why doesn't someone publish facsimilies of his scores, 
>>at least, with a guide to reading them, so that we can 
>>just peruse his scores in libraries like every
>>other major composer of this century?
My intial questions are:
1) who owns the rights to Partch works?
and, of course, 
2) when's the last time you tried to get your hands
on the work of a 'major composer', like Ligeti
San Fran Polyphony, in a "library", and been told it 
has been back-ordered for the past ten years!
