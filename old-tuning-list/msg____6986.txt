Subject: What do you play ?

From: Eduardo Sabat <esabat@adinet.com.uy>

The only microtonal instrument I play is Dinarra (read deenarha).

First of all I must congratulate to John Starrett by his exelent idea to
make the poll of the musical microtonal instruments.

Luthier Germano Banchetti was the fist to refret a guitar into dinarra.
In those times (70=B4s) he lived in Montevideo, and in the 80=B4s he back to=
 his
land Arezzo, Italy. He told me he had a brother of him working as luthier in
the New York (USA) area.=20
Germano refreted three acoustic guitars. With the second one I played in
Hawaii in Nov. 1978. To day (1998) he must be a man of about 70.=20

---------------------
Luthier Ariel Ameijenda refreted two acoustic and two electric (Washburn
brand) guitars.
Also he made ENTIRE four acoustic Dinarras. The soundboard of one of them
was made of Canadian (pink) Pine and the three others of Alerce Pine (from
the south of Argentina).=20

In this moment there are some pupils that play dinarra better than me.
