From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

To my last posting, let me add one more reference, which Partch may or may
not have seen (in any case, a copy was surely placed in the California
State Library), the _Harmonic Structure and Elementary Composition_ of
Charles Seeger and Edward Stricklin, written for instruction at UCB in
1916, and probably familiar to Seeger*s student, Cowell. In chapter five of
this work, minor is derived from _undertones_, which are physically derived
by lengthening a string. I think this reference is useful to illustrate
that the essential ideas were _in the air_ at the time, and a
scholar-composer like Seeger, who was familar with the German scholarship
available during his years in Koeln as assistant conductor in the Opera
House, was a leeding intellectual figure in the bay area. Likewise, the
school of music at USC, which Partch attended for a while, had a real
German (and Riemannian) bias. It is interesting to note that the Swiss
speculative theorist Hans Kayser was only 10 years Partch´s senior, and
their harmonic structures are quite similar in construction.
