Subject: Cage Rage

From: curley@ucla.edu (Doren Garcia)

Fellow MicroNauts,

Interesting discussion about Cage. Reminds me of something SunRa said. "I
never heard anything I didn't like." In other words Mr. Blount found
something in everything.

Cage had something to offer,  not much but something. Schoenberg had
something,  not much but something. Beethoven had a lot to offer. Some have
more some have less.

Music is not constructed purely from intellect. If it don't swing it don't
mean a thing. We need theoreticians and we should respect the hard work
they do but music is communication and if it is not communication from the
heart, what does it communicate?

This thing isn't a race or a contest. Wise people take what they can use
and ignore or at least tolerate the rest, to do otherwise is to waste time.

This is true of Cage and Brian. Most of what Brian writes about is above my
head, so why worry. I read what I think will enlighten me and skip the
rest.
