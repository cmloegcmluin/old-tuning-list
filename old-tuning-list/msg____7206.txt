Oh, by the way, you may also want to use by far the most common approach
to mapping microtones to electronic keyboards, which is simply to map each
of the 25 pitches, in succession to successive pitches on the keyboard,
mismatching octave boundaries on the 7+5 layout of the keyboard with octave
boundaries in the tuning.

   I personally find it utterly incomprehensible that anybody could play
such a construction!  But the apparent truth of the matter is that far more
microtonal keyboardists seem to do it that way than trying to split the
tuning up into switchable subset scales.  People who have done that include
Harry Partch (on his Chromelodeon), Ivor Darreg on his "Detwelvulate!" CD
(and elsewhere), Jonathan Glasier, Easley Blackwood, Bill Sethares
(although he frequently plays from guitar controllers), and Brian McLaren.

   I suppose it's worth noting, however, that Easley Blackwood and Harry
Partch translated the music performed that way in equivalent 12TET notation
before performing that music.  (By "translated to equivalent 12TET
notation", I mean rewriting the music to show the 12TET notes that
correspond to the same keys, but not the same pitches, as what will produce
the desired microtonal notes.)

   One notable figure who - apparently - uses groups of subset modes
instead is Wendy Carlos.
