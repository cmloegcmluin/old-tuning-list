I don't think this is necessarily true. The archlute or theorbo were common
bass continuo instruments and thus were often paired with a harpsichord.

But in regards to this question and Neil Haverstick's original question
about Bach jamming with Weiss, let's do a brief reality check. Given what
we know about tuning practices of the time, which did not include counting
beats, as Ed Foote reminds us, there was undoubtedly a significant margin
of error for any tuning, let alone some circulating temperament with no
pure intervals other than the octave.

Leaving aside the special case of the organ, these were workaday musicians
who probably "touched up" the tuning of their harpsichords pretty much
every day. I can tell you from experience that you're not going to spend 45
minutes every day getting every interval at the top end of the keyboard
exact (if indeed that were possible). The story that Bach could tune his
harpsichord in 15 minutes is thus completely believable though still
impressive.

Now, the difference between pure and ET thirds is about 15 cents. If you
consider that most thirds in most temperaments of the period are going to
be compromised in the direction of ET, they are going to be frequently in
the range of 5 to 10 cents away. In a treble register, this is within the
margin of error of even good singers, fretless strings, and woodwinds.
(Remember that these are not modern woodwinds, either.) The margin of error
grows, of course, with the size of the ensemble and speed of the piece. (By
the way, the seeming beat-spotlighting character of the long consonances in
slow movements is mostly an illusion: performers at that time would
improvise filler and ornaments in such occasions.)

In this context, the practical differences between temperaments like some
of Neidhardt's and Marpurg's and ET are angels dancing on the head of pin.

This is not to say that temperament was not important to Bach or that he
couldn't hear the difference, but that it is a matter of degree of
acceptability in practical music making. If I had been present when he and
Weiss jammed, I'm sure that, in the wonder of the music of the moment, a
few acoustical beats here or there would probably be the last thing on my
mind.
