Can you have good music without intellectual understanding?  I
was thinking intellectual understanding when I wrote that.

I have composed about 20 hours of JI music using a sequencer I
wrote, and made JI arrangements of about 20 hours more of the
work of other composers.  Unfortunately, when I wrote the JI
sequencer, I limited it to 12 tones.  Now I am working on a DSP
based project that would extend the possible tones to about 40,
but it will likely be a while till I get it done, since I now
have a full-time day job.

Actually I have played with JI scales that have notes that are
close enough that you probably couldn't hear the difference if
the notes were sounded in isolation.  But if I sound one note,
and then introduce other notes from some consonant triad, and
then sound the second, close note and then introduce notes from a
triad consonant with the second note, I get an effect that is
very like a musical pun.  I use that quite often in my
compositions, which is why I am puzzled by all the complaints I
hear about 'commas'.  Of course you can't do this reliably if you
are uncertain about the tuning accuracy of system on which you
are performing, which is why I insist on exact JI techniques.

Is it fair to select JI scales that don't allow for ambiguity by
discounting scales that contain these 'commas', and then knock JI
because it can't support musical puns?

This is probably so, under the tuning limitations of current
hardware, but I don't think it will always be so.  When we get
hardware with better tuning accuracy, we can go to scales with
more pitches.

The limited tuning accuracy of the Yamaha FM synthesis chips was
one of the major factors in my decision to limit my first
sequencer to 12 tones.

I have composed in dozens of JI scales.  I couldn't have done
this without the analysis tools I developed for FasTrak.  I would
feel quite the prisoner if I were to be restricted to one scale.
