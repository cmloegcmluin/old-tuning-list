The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians has an excellent description 
under "Mode".  See also under "Tonality" for more on the difference between 
modes and keys.

Several of the articles in Music Theory Online also illuminate the 
distinction.  Look around in http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/mtohome.html

Standard books on Western music history *ought* to have good descriptions, 
but many I've seen are very sparse on the pre-Baroque era.

Discussions tend to get thwarted by different usages of the word "mode".  For 
example, Bill Alves appears to view modes as little more than types of 
scales.  (They are very often described as such when an author is trying to 
be brief, perhaps the cause of the growing general impression that that's all 
there is to them.)  Daniel Wolf sees modes in certain patterns of 
harmonization.  I use the term as the composers themselves did when 
indicating that a composition is composed *in* a particular mode, as 
(for example) Merulo did with his toccatas.  I believe this is how other 
Medieval and Renaissance writers used the term as well.  This is analogous to 
saying that a Mozart piano sonata is *in* the key of C Major, but as the 
above articles show, there is an important musical difference.

My comment that started this off would be expressed more accurately, I think, 
as: Very few, if any, (Western classical) works have been written *in* a mode 
in the era of 12TET.
