Wasn't *that* special?

Huh?  This must be a slip of the pen ("hij zonder zonden werpt de eerste
steen...").  To what should this refer?

Hm.  Equal temperament on an organ before 1685?  (Please, Mr.
Reinhard, even *I* wouldn't have gone that far!)  Could you cite the source
of the organological examination?  I would be very curious to read it.

You are correct.  (Just wanted to see if you were on your toes.) Fragments
of it are also contained in Sulzer's _Allgemeine Theorie der Schoenen
Kuenste._ (1771); the "Vorbericht" of Marpurg's _Versuch ueber die
musikalische Temperatur._ (1776); and Marpurg's _Legende einiger
Musikheiligen._(1786).

I have already admitted that I dislike Equal Temperament, yet I find myself
defending it (the mind boggles).  How much more open-minding would Mr.
Reinhard have me be?  Perhaps defend the piano as a better vehicle for
Bach's keyboard music than the harpsichord?

Hallelujah!  Finally something we agree upon...

Why bother with translations?  Why not read the originals?

Of course I agree that most Bach sounds wonderful in Circular
temperaments.  But I disagree that there is no evidence to show that the
temperament that Bach used was ET or something close to it.
