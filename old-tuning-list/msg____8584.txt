Hey Joao (and rest of the TUNING gang),

I've been thinking on and off about the idea of just intonation on a
trombone, ever since your post a few weeks ago.

At 03:54 PM 9/14/98 -0400, you wrote (TUNING Digest 1529, Topic 3):

To get a step closer to your goal, I worked out some of the math, and "Ta
Da" - I just created a web page that calculates the frequency of the note a
trombone will sound, based on the slide position and the harmonic:

        http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/bonefreq.htm

The page uses "JavaScript", so hopefully it'll work with most web browsers.
I welcome any and all comments on the page from the group, such as "It
doesn't work", or "It gives the wrong answer".

Maybe the next step would be to have a web page that provides the slide
position and harmonic, based on the frequency?  (That's a little more
tricky, due to the possibility of alternate positions for the same note.)

Trombones rule, ...,

P.S.:  Feel free to forward this along to "TROMBONE-L", or whatever other
groups you posed your question to.
