Subject: introductions---Rusty

From: Michael.Saunders@astro.cf.ac.uk (Michael Saunders)

I joined the list last week, so I thought it's about time I introduced myself.
I'm a graduate student in the physics department of the University of
Wales, Cardiff (but I'm American).  It's the physics department, but I'm in 
the computer music section---my thesis project is called Rusty.  It's a 
graphical computer language (the graphical interface is actually written by
a colleague) which looks like a modular syntesizer on the screen---you can
plug subprogram-units together to exchange data.  The difference is, instead
of the signals being simple voltages, they can be all sorts of complex 
musical objects.  Most of my work involves writing the class library which 
describes these objects---the classes are very natural (e.g., meter, 
harmony, chord, scale, pulse, etc.)  Lately I've been working on the classes
for pitch, scale and tuning.  The tuning technique I use allows you to 
define arbitrary scales as networks of intervals between scale degrees and, 
since the intervals are defined with fuzzy logic, optimal temperaments are
found automatically.  I'm also doing work on extending the tuning of a scale
to tuning all the notes of a score individually, and more exotic things, 
like altering the spectra of sounds to fit a scale.  Although it won't be 
ready for download for quite a while, it's written in Java, so, when it runs,
it will run on nearly everthing.
