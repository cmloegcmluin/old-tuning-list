Subject: 7-limit references

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Harold,

I don't think you're going to find a lot more on this than what you've 
already read and the references that have been given, although a number of 
1/1 articles I have seen would probably be of interest to you. If you can 
read German, there may be a lot more; check out the most recent bibliography 
at the Tuning ftp site (ftp://ella.mills.edu/pub/ccm/tuning/papers) for all 
of these. Hey, is Tartini in that bibliography? His is perhaps the earliest 
attempt at incorporating 7-limit harmony into music.
