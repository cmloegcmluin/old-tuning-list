Subject: Look -- he takes the bait!

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

List:

How canny of Bill Alves to put the hook out with the 'existence of
"unauthentic" Partch performances does not preclude corporeal"' comment; he
must have known I couldn't resist!

>Of course not, because they are two different things, each with its own

Am in complete agreement, as I mentioned my participation and delight in
both forms.  My weighting (in this discussion) towards *live* performance
with *live* musicians was charted along one of the lines often discussed
here: why is there so little non-12TET music being created and performed (or
why is 12TET still so dominant), and why that which is produced seems so
often ignored or undervalued.  

I imagine that Western microtonal music (or however you would describe what
goes on here in the tuning list) will remain a fairly small circle of
cognoscenti until/unless more is done to evoke both live performance and
performable 'settings' (scores, plots, general improvisation instructions to
others, etc).  I realize that, above all, there are still things that can't
be done or explored fully by humans; this alone makes the 'recorded
performance' medium a worthwhile and potentially artistic endeavor.

I don't think Paul Turner intended to snub music created as a vehicle for
human-participatory involvement, but the comment tweaked an idea
nonetheless.  If people think that more CD's of computer-generated
intonational pieces will make inroads to the world at large, fine; does seem
pretty solitary to me.  Oh well, what are universities for?  :-)

[No Partch rebuttal at this time: my parole officer won't allow it.]
