Subject: Re: MIcrotonalLENNIUM

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Following the success of the Charles Ives polymicrotonal *Universe 
Symphony* in Lincoln Center on 6/6/96 (Bells and Microtones, A Legend 
Comes to Life, Alex Ross - New York Times), the AFMM plans a microMay '97 
series in NYC (submissions and suggestions welcome).

After that - MIcrotonalLENNIUM: the diminishing interval before the 
millennium in which the AFMM Ensemble will be sponsoring tours (of a 
variety of programs) throughout the continent.  At this time point people 
are setting up venues and preparing resources.  The AFMM hopes to fund 
travelling costs.

MIcrotonalLENNIUM addresses the absence of AFMM U.S. performances 
outside of NYC, Denver, Seattle, and Trenton.  Contrastingly, we have 
performed more often in Europe (France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy).

If the publicity garnered by the Ives project transfers continentally 
throughout North America can bring public awareness of alternative 
tuning, but the time the millennium arrives, microtones will be 
established (e.g. microtones are of the last century...read: normal).

Perhaps once fears of armageddan pass in the year 2001, who knows, people 
might even rediscover leisure.  Microtones would then be part of their 
culture.  Any ideas, suggestions, contacts?
