Subject: New JI Ear Trainer version

From: alves@osiris.ac.hmc.edu (Bill Alves)

Version 2.0 of the Just Intonation Ear Trainer is now available via my home
page (URL below). This version is mainly the result of the new xcmds kindly
contributed by Ken Wauchope. These functions make it possible for the JIET
to be run on PowerMacs for the first time and also allow for the selection
of different instrumental timbres via QuickTime Musical Instruments.

Therefore, there are now three different versions. There is a version 2
file available for both PPC and 68k Macs. These do require QuickTime and
QuickTime Musical Instruments. Version 1 is still available, but it ONLY
works on 68k Macs (that is, it will NOT work on PowerMacintoshes). However,
QuickTime is not required for version 1.

I have had some problems switching between instruments when using QuickTime
2.1 that Ken could not replicate. However, I have not had any problems
using QuickTime 2.5. Therefore I say that QuickTime 2.5 is required, but
2.1 may work depending on your system.

As before, please let me know of any bugs, problems, or suggestions. I ask
only that you do not sell it without permission and that, if you find it
useful, you send me a shareware fee of $10 OR a recording of music in
non-traditional tuning.

I will try to put these versions into the Mills ftp site when I have time,
though if someone else wants to, they are welcome to.

Bill
