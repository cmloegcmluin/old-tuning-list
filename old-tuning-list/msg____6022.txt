I am told that Denny Genovese will be posting the "JI Reference" to the
Southeast Just Intonation Center WWW site.  Although it is not complete, I
hope that people will have a chance to peruse it and submit alterations
and additions before the "first edition" is complete.  If it is not posted
soon, please email me and I will send out a copy to anyone interested.

I would especially appreciate it if some of the more "adavnced" tuning
minds on this list would volunteer to criticize it immediately, before we
post it on the web.
