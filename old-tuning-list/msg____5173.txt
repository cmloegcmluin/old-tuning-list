Perhaps humans are lousy antennae because they haven't been properly tuned. If
the 'sensitivity' within ones hands can be increased with practice, (and no 
musician could deny the possibility of this) what other sensitivities might be
'in waiting?' And what 'stations' might they be tuned in to? For example, a 
chef's use of the 'sensitivity' in his hands could be looked at from the 
perspective of being 'tuned to different station' than the one that a 
cellist's might be tuned to. Each could also potentially increase in the 
subtleties of awareness not fore seen until they arrived there. And this is 
just in regards to the hands.

As much as I wish it weren't the case, I must admit that my perceptions are 
only as keen as I have prepared them. Following on from that, one might even 
go as far as arguing that the limits that I (as a lousy antenna) operate under
are self imposed.

But, then again one might not.
