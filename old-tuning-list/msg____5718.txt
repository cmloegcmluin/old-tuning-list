   Hmmm...  Well, certainly you can phase them so that the zero-crossings
never correspond, or microscopically detune them, by 1/5Hz for example,
they will not correspond very closely for very long, and yet we recognize
both as octaves.

   Here's another curious observation to throw into this line of inquiry.
I suppose it could be just me, but I'd be surprised if so:

   I have found there to be something interesting about ratios of the form
(N+1):N.  I've noticed that if I listen to a narrow range of small,
adjacent Ns for long enough, they start masquerading as one another.

   An easy example to hear occurs when I practice singing the distinction
between 6:5 and 7:6 thirds.  After I sing and think about nothing but those
two intervals for five minutes or so, I find that the 6:5 starts having the
sensation I normally associate with 5:4.  "Sensation" in the sense that I'm
inclined to momentarily misidentify 6:5 as 5:4 - an auditory illusion in
essence.  And further, when I suddenly toss into the mix a 5:4, it starts
seeming like a 4:3, and 3:2 seems like an octave.

   I'd be curious as to whether anybody else has noticed this effect too.
