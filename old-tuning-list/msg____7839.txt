My 7-limit lattice is of course a face-centered cubic lattice, distinct
from the hexagonal lattice which packs space just as efficiently but is
less symmetrical. I came up with the idea on my own, and while at first
it perplexed John Chalmers, he later found it to be quite similar to
what Erv Wilson had done (exactly the same, in fact, except that Wilson
may (or may not) have simply seen the lattice as existing in two
dimensions, while I definitely see the two-dimensional representation as
being a projection of the three-dimensional one). In fact, my triangular
lattices show Wilson's CPS scales as the most symmetrical arrangements
of tones, while cubic lattices show Euler genera as more symmetrical.

Well, I don't know if it really beats a major triad, but otherwise, I
quite agree. Here's the interesting thing. When I worked out a model for
harmonic entropy, which should also describe critical band roughness if
the partials decrease in amplitude in some specific fashion, I derived
that to a good approximation, the complexity of a just ratio is directly
related to its DENOMINATOR. Later, imposing octave equivalence made me
change this to ODD LIMIT, but I admit that it's possible that octave
equivalence does not really come in to the "objective" dissonance of an
interval.

Now the chord 4:6:9 has three intervals: 3:2, 3:2, and 9:4. The highest
denominator is 4. The chord 4:5:6 has a 3:2, a 5:4, and a 6:5. The
highest denominator is 5. So judging from the intervals alone, you
appear to be right that the 4:6:9 is more consonant. However, I think
the chord as a whole has something that the intervals alone don't
explain, as evidenced by the differing levels of consonance in otonal
and utonal chords. On the whole-chord basis, which has proved
impenetrable to the type of analysis that led me to the denominator rule
for intervals, I think the major triad would win.

The chord 8:9:12 has the intervals 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8. The highest
denominator is 8 -- pretty dissonant!

Can you give a concrete example?

This may not work if consistency doesn't hold.

Isn't that what Carl Lumma said? But no, you guys are wrong, and that's
the whole reason for the consistency concept. Wendy Carlos, Yunik and
Swift, and others also seem to have missed out on the importance of
consistency.

I don't think it helps all that much. I think Paul Hahn would agree with
you, though.

I think so. There are more "irrational" tunings with one generator, but
they cannot be considered meantones.

I've thought about that too, but I don't know. It is awfully close to
the harmonically optimal meantones in my paper.

Huh? It definitely means fewer positions in which to play a given chord.
