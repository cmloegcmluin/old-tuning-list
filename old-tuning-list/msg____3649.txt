Your new algorithm is not correct either -- at least it does not reproduce 
my definition of consistency. In particular, no tuning can fail to be level 
1 consistent according to your algorithm, and some tunings would be level 2 
consistent according to this algorithm that wouldn't be according to your 
original definition. I will give the correct consistency algorithm if you 
wish. John C., you are correct that "fractional consistency" is kind of 
meaningless; I was using it in the sense of Paul H.'s original definition 
with respect to the maximum error size.

I was responding to your assertion that common-practice harmony did not find 
7-tET sufficient. Clearly, 7-tET would not provide the desired harmonic 
effect when used for common-practice harmony. I believe the reasons lie not 
with higher-level consistency but with accuracy.

But the actual historical reasons for not adopting 7-tET lie not with 
5-limit, but even earlier with 3-limit harmony, as practiced in Medieval 
music. Although 7-tET may have a high level of consistency within the 
3-limit, its accuracy in approximating 3-limit consonances is questionable. 
Medieval musicians tuned fifths and fourths with enough accuracy that is was 
clearly seen that the eighth note in a circle of fifths was different from 
the first. Thus the process of chromatic alteration began that ultimately 
led to 12-tET. In China, fifths and fourth were also the main harmonic 
consonances, and China developed 12-tET before the West did. In Thailand, 
however, the accuracy of the fifths and fourths was less important, since 
their role was more melodic than harmonic and because most Thai instruments 
do not have harmonic partials. Thus it is not surprising that Thailand did 
develop 7-tET.

Well, the idea of using 5-tET for 5-limit harmony bothers me. Didn't you 
read my post? I explained why, even though 7-tET is consistent at the 
5-limit, it is not a good tuning for 5-limit harmony. The same goes for 
5-tET. If a tuning is both consistent and has good approximations to JI 
however, then I will admit it, even if the second-order intervals do not 
behave as in JI. I think 22-tET is marginally good enough for 9-limit 
harmony, if the texture doen't get too thin, but observe:  64/63, an 8/7 
less a 9/8, is 4-4=0 steps, while 81/80, a 9/8 less a 10/9, is 4-3=1 step. 
"In other words, a larger interval becomes a unison while a smaller interval 
does not." This doesn't bother me in the slightest -- in fact I like it.

The ear does not have a pre-defined map of JI; it does, however, perceive 
consonance, dissonance, and scale structures. Sometimes the most effective 
scale structures for consonance differ significantly from JI, but I think 
these differences can be just fine, even necessary, unless they violate 
simple consistency.
