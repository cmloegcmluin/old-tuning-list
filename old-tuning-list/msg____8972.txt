No sir.  Partch would have been greatful for the DX7.  He who says
otherwise is a gentleman and... an academic.  According to the Gilmore bio,
Partch resented academia's treatment of his work, grouping him with Cage,
etc.  I resent it to.  For me Partch's message about primitive man is
important, and not so nearly as important as his contribution to tuning in
music.  Regular academics cannot handle either one of these things, and by
saying stuff like this, the Partch academics show they cannot handle them
either.

Perhaps Harry erred on the side of being too rash.  Perhaps I err in the
same way.  But at least this has the benefit of making people check things
out for themselves, whereas academia would have us all stuffy with trusting.
