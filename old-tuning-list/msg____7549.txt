Subject: Foxy Lady

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	The correct version Paul Erlich's article "Tuning, Tonality and 22 Tone 
Equal Temperament" is now on my page in .pdf format (thanks to Carl 
Lumma) under Notes on Microtonality. 
	For those of you who misplaced your Hendrix albums, I have a few 
bars of Foxy Lady in Real Audio Streaming format on my page near the top. 
All you need to hear it is the free Real Audio plugin.
	BTW, I noticed Kami Rousseau 
http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/
has a few new microtonal MIDI files on his page. 
	Does anyone on the list keep current with the MIDI standard? Do 
we know if there are any changes under discussion by the committee that 
would assist microtonalists?
