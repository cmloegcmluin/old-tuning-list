   I'm familiar with Logic and Logic Audio, but not with Logic Audio
Discovery.  I've been off the past year and a half learning the saxophone
so that I can use my WX-11 more effectively for Logic-Audio-based
sequencing, so I haven't been keeping up with Emagic's latest products.

   But anyway, if 'Discovery is anything like Logic and Logic Audio
themselves, then the answer would probably be much more a function of your
particular sound generator than of the program.
