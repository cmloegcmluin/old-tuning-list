Subject: scary micromusic

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

An interesting thing happened today...I was playing, on my stereo, 
some music by a rather well known microtonalist. My daughter was also 
listening, and asked who it was. I told her, and asked what she thought 
of it (I already knew, though). She said she didn't like it, that it 
reminded her of two very frightening people who used to be in her life, 
and that it sounded like music that they used to play. She asked if I 
would turn it off, and I did...fact is, this music DID sound weird and 
scary, and I can understand why it would frighten a little kid. And, this 
is a little kid who has, indeed, heard a lot of music, and much of it 
pretty out there.
    What is the point? Well, I guess it has something to do with the 
message one is putting across in their art. This music sounded creepy to 
me as well, and I cannot imagine ever playing it for anyone in the world, 
at any time. I see absolutely no value in this music, no matter what 
tuning system it is in...the sad thing, of course, is where is the person 
coming from that wrote/performed it? I truly believe that this person is 
reflecting their inner state, and that is too bad, indeed. By the way, 
this is the 2nd time this scenario has occured lately...in the other 
incident, I was at a friend's house, who is an avant garde sort of (12 
tone) keyboard player. I was playing yet another prominant 
microtonalist's music, and was asked to take it off of the stereo because 
this fellow couldn't take it...it made him feel very depressed. Again, I 
had to agree...it was not music that I would play for anyone else.
    It's tricky...I certainly think music should express the full range 
of human experience. On the other hand, music that reminds a little kid 
of certain perverts (they are that) is not, to my way of thinking, a good 
thing. Again, it makes me sad for the artist in question as well. I have 
long felt that much micromusic focuses on too narrow a band of feelings, 
sort of a cerebral, weird melange of bleeps, bloops, and noodling. I 
still do. There is a sort of (hate to say it) unhuman, removed, detached 
kind of music that I feel is totally invalid as meaningful art...this is 
the stuff that my kid was responding to today (and, a piece that gives me 
much the same feeling is Schoenberg's Violin Concerto...it's like being 
in a padded cell with white walls and a lot of Prozac)...of course, as 
they say, opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one...Hstick
