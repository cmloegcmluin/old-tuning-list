Subject: Ghost Tones?? reply to Matt&GottaStik

From: clucy@cix.compulink.co.uk (Charles Lucy)

This missive is to answer Thursday's references to LucyTuning, and
my prior comments; by both Matt Nathan and Haverstick.
 
 
I put them together as they are both concerned with the same
possible ambiguities of the terms: harmonic(s), partials, nodes, etc.
 
*
When I touch a guitar string gently at specific points, I can hear
tones which are "higher" than the open string or the fretted string.
*
 
 
Now that I have your attention, let's explore some possibilities!
 
Probably everyone on this list has read Helmholtz, most have also
prolly read Baccus (God of Whine?). They explain the conventional
wisdom in tuning theory and the arithmetc of musical acoustics.
 
I read both many years ago, when I was first curious about
tuning. My copies are somewhere under a dismantled aeroplane
in a barn in Herefordshire UK. I abandoned humping hard copies
around the planet, many years ago, when I realised that they
are in every local library when I need them.
 
Now let's go back to the stars (* & *)
(i.e. the sentence between the stars)
 
and work through an alternative perspective slowly
 
What are these tones???
 
 
Conventional wisdom tells us that these tones are
HARMONICS.
Matt Nathan suggests that we call them
NODES
Some people would call them
OVERTONES
Others would call them
"Ghost tones", "Sweet high tones", "singing notes",
[The list is as long and poetic as you like to make it.]
 
^
The traditional mathematical model of musical tuning and
acoustics states that these "ghost tones" (for sake of a better
term) are found at frequencies which are small integer ratios
to the fundamental or open string frequency.
This is the assumption upon which Just Intonation is based.
^
 
[So far, so good?
Do we all agree?
Is this true?
i.e. lack of controversy?]
 
Now let us consider the sentences between the ^ hats ^.
 
No! Let's wait for your replies, (agreement?)
 
Then we can continue to explore another way for the
"blind man to describe the elephant".
