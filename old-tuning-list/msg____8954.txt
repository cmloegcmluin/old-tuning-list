Subject: Tuning List Down

From: "David Madole" <madole@ella.mills.edu>

Sorry!!!!

As I'm sure some of you noticed, the list was down for a significant 
amount of time.  The reason for this is that I left Mills back in June,
and I no longer really regularly check my mail here, as my life has moved on.
My successor at Mills is not interested in continuing with the listserver.

It is time to start to arrange to move the list.  I will provide all of 
the support I possibly can to whomever decides to take it over - it would
be best to be moved to another list server running listproc 6.0, or listserv,
if possible.  I will even help get the listserver compiled and running  (but
not maintain it) if that is necessary.

If you have any ideas, please send the mail to my new address, madole@dnai.com.

Dave
