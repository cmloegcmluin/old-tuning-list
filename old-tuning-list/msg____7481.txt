Subject: Vai and microtones

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Drew...you mentioned Steve Vai using 22 on a record...in fact, 
according to a 1993 Guitar World interview, he does, indeed, have 2 micro 
guitars, one in 24 and one in 16...he said he used the 16 for a teensy 
background part on his "Sex and Religion" album, but it wasn't any 
significant usage. It bugs me that he has these axes, but doesn't use 
them to drop the other shoe and make a CD with them as the feature 
tuning. If a Vai finally goes for it, it will advance the cause of other 
tunings by a great amount..Hstick  PS Junko Shigeta and I had a marvelous 
gig last nite in Denver, doing traditional Japanese music and music in 19 
and 34 tone eq..we had a good audience, and a lot of musicians showed 
up...
