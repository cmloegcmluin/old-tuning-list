As kind of an addendum to Garys statements re using CDRs vs.
cassettes,  I'll throw in a pitch for the MiniDisc as well.

What little they suffer in terms of quality vis-a-vis a
noncompressed digital format like CD or DAT, they make
up for in portability.  You get nearly the same random
access ability as with CD, you can even set loops up,
and they're hard to beat for rugged, tiny good sounding
audio-on-the-go.

IMHO, they best all but the most fastidiously aligned
cassette machines, and the latest Sony home decks (JE-510)
are sub $300 now, and sound great.  I have the slightly
earlier JE-500, and find that the live recordings I've
done with it are better than those I've made with 
dbx and metal cassettes on my Marantz PMD-430.

YMMV, of course.  

(Then again, neither sound as good to me as 10.5 inch reels of tape
@15ips but you won't see me with one of those on the subway,
either. ;-)
