Re:  practical vs. theoretical implementations of microtonality

This discussion is based upon several false assumptions.  Some 
corrections....

1.  There is no such thing as a Kurzweil K3000.  You must be referring to 
the K2500.
2.  It is very simple to do octave shifts of instruments.  Multiple pitch 
tables are not necessary to do more than 17 notes per octave for a piano 
range instrument.  If you need instruments with 250 discrete pitches, 
assuming that they repeat by octaves, you can create the pitch table once, 
copy the instrument and then merely shift the pitch by octaves to create 
the full scale pitch range.  This is not possible with the Ensoniq series 
of samplers however (see next item).
3.  The author seems to be mistaking the architecture of the Ensoniq series 
with other manufacturers instruments as well.  The Ensoniq samplers cannot 
store the program parameters (tunings, filter settings, etc.) separate from 
the sample RAM.  This is one of the great weaknesses of the ASR-10.  The 
other is the limitation of loading 8 instruments.  Kurzweil and I believe 
E-mu and Akai can and do allow multiple program settings using a common set 
of samples.  So all these calculations starting with a 32M sample bank and 
then multiplying it by X times are wrong except for those using an Ensoniq. 
 To do the octave shifts one merely needs to copy a few hundred bytes of 
program RAM and readjust the relevent parameter.
4.  The assumption is made that tuning tables are the only means of 
creating a non-12 note scale on instruments without full scale tuning 
tables.  This is correct only when talking about non-equally spaced scales. 
 For equal tempered scales on the Kurzweil K2000 and K2500, it is very easy 
to adjust the keymap tracking parameter to a rough value so that the 
individual samples track the pitch range they were intended for.  One then 
adjusts one of the two available pitch modulation sources to fine tune the 
pitch tracking to get a tuning accurate to +-1 cent over the entire MIDI 
range.  Since the Kurzweil gives the pitch tracking modulation depth in 
real units of cents, it is very easy to calculate the proper values for any 
equal tempered scale, including non-octave repeating scales such as the 
Carlos alpha, beta and gamma scales.  I recently gave an example of this to 
a tuning list member for 19TET and I believe he forwarded those parameters 
to this list.  On the Kurzweil instruments this is stored as a program 
parameter in program RAM, not in sample RAM.  The K2000 and K2500 are 
limited to 999 programs per instrument.  I believe this to be an adequate 
number for most users even though you would have to use  separate programs 
for the same sample set in 19TET and 31TET scales (but again, no extra 
sample RAM).  Any one of these 999 programs are instantly available by a 
MIDI extended program change message.  Multiple ET scales could even be 
mixed within the same composition and sequence.  It takes a few minutes to 
calculate the parameters for a new ET scale and about 30 seconds to program 
each instrument.
5.  The K2500 and Emu EIV both allow 128M of sample memory.  The lowest 
cost Kurzweil option is to get a K2500R (Rack) without the sampling option 
for about $2500.  You don't need the sampling option to use samples, only 
to do your own sampling from microphone, line or digital inputs!  The SIMM 
slots and SCSI interface are on the basic unit.  30 pin 16Mx8 RAM is 
currently running $95-$120, so the full 128Mbyte cost is less than $1000.   
Of course, the assumption that you need this much is entirely wrong.  Add 
64M RAM, the Program RAM option, a SCSI CD-ROM drive, a 1 or 2 Gig hard 
drive and several sample CD-ROMs and the total price ticket is $4000-$4500. 
 Yes, this is expensive, no doubt about it, but it is also one hellaciously 
powerful system.
6. Software updates do occur, especially for the more expensive instruments,
 so the situation is not entirely hopeless.  I urge everyone to contact the 
manufacturers and request microtonal tuning capabilities.  Make sure they 
know that your purchase decision is dependent upon this feature.  I am 
personally working with Kurzweil on these matters and would love for other 
manufacturers to be responsive as well.  One problem is that there is no 
consensus as to what microtonal users want.  One user may want only a few 
full keyboard tuning scales while another may want dozens of octave based 
scales that can be selected on the fly for complex just intonation 
modulations.  And let's be realistic, no mass market manufacturer will 
support resolutions to .01 cents or better because the VLSI chips simply 
aren't that accurate.  Users needing this accuracy will have to rely on 
specialized systems like KYMA or the Justonics synthesizer.
  
For Marcus Hobbs:
The literate I've seen on the Ensoniq MR Rack says it has only one RAM 
tuning table location.  Is this incorrect?
