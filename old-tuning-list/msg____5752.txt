I used the phrase "complete chords" in the literal English sense of
"chords from which no notes are missing" rather than specifically
Euler complete chords.  I also used the word "saturated" in a
different sense to you.   Sorry for any confusion this caused.

Symmetrical saturated chords are indeed Wilson CPSs (e.g. 2)1.3.3.5).
They are also Euler genera without the first and last notes.  I can't
make of these definitions work for the non-symmetrical, non-o/utonal
chords mentioned in my more recent post.

I haven't worked out the implications of triangular lattices yet.
Are they what I would call Hexagonal lattices -- that is, is every
point directly connected to 6 others?  How do you measure distances
on them?  How do you extend them to multiple dimensions? Do they
work without octave invariance?

As I haven't received Digest 1122 yet, I can't be sure my message
was in it.  If it wasn't, I'll re-post: it contains the conclusions
I was working towards through looking at octave reduced ROHSs.
However, there is a mistake in it; non-square powers of primes cause
the same problems as rhubarb numbers.  The only such number small
enough to be musically relevant is 27.  With n', m, for example,
the interval 33/1 will arise.
