  yes, it uses the Macintosh Speech engine. So if you want your piece to
sound like HAL then it works great, if you want your piece to sound like a
human its not so great. It is fun to mess with though....

I have been working with a  major DSP company on a "singing"
computer(classical voice--male(tenor)--female(sop.)). The results, still
need work, but sound surprisingly human. I will post a web page soon if
anybody is interested...
