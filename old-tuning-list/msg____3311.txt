Thanks for responding so quickly, Manuel. Still can't get Help to work 
though.

I had...
  BUFFERS=10,0
  FILES=40
..and I've tried increasing them just in case, but still no Help.

It doesn't look corrupted. These lines are there. I even downloaded the 
whole zip file again.

I'm confident it's not that. I'm not running Windows, or anything much, 
at the same time as Scala.

All these work perfectly. In fact I think _everything_  is working except 
for Help. And my printer. If my printer was working I could print out the 
help file :-(

Maybe I should wait for that! I'm really enjoying using your program and 
have been filling my S760 with re-tuned samples.
