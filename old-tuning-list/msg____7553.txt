   Thanks Dave, for the details on your results.

   Do you have any way of characterizing your process' margin of error?
That is, could these sounds be absolutely exactly harmonic (short of noise
components and human/random fluctuations in the entire tone of course), and
your process could only detect their pitch within that accuracy (that of
course being quite impressive accuracy)?  Or is it more likely, in your
view, that these pitch deviations from exact harmonic frequencies are very
definitely present in the overtone structures of the tones?
