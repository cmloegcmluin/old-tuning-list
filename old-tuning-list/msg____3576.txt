From: linusliu@hk.super.net (Linus Liu)

I find it interesting that tunners on this list cannot tell when music
is out of tune.

I was asked once after I played for a wedding, he often could tell
violinists playing out of tune. He was sure that the violinists 
themselves could tell it too. But what he could never understand was
why those violinists never tried to correct it.

One Christmas when my baby was very small, I was carrying her walking 
pass a shopping arcade. The loudspeakers were playing some carols by
some adults-pretending-like-kids. In order not let my daughter hear
out-of-tune singing, I sang into her ears myself along with the
carols. And the sales-girls in the shops came out to see who was
singing.

My daughter won 3rd prize in grade 1 piano competition at 4,
3rd prize in grade 2 at 5, 2nd prize in grade 3 at six, in the 
open schools music festival open competition here. The last
competition has 54 competitors, she was of course the youngest.
She cannot read music. But she can play all notes and harmony just
listening to the pieces a few times. She began to compose her
little pieces at three.

My daughter will not listen to other violinists. I brought her
to one violin concert, and I dare not bring her to another because
her complaining (for the violinist playing out of tune) will disturb
the other audiences. I sometimes would try to let her guest if it
is I playing or someone else. Before I could ask, she would scream
and shout, "shut it off, its terrible."

The Linus Liu intonation is for music.

Thats why we do sliding on the violin.
