Subject: 88CET #17:  Voice Spacing in Counterpoint

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

In nonoctave tunings, chord-tone spacing is no longer independent of chord
quality (sonority).  In 88CET, you can't, for example, have a subminor triad
spanning more than an octave, or a major triad spanning less than an octave.
The subminor third is only available within the first octave's span, and the
major third is only available in the second-octave's span as a major tenth.  

   What does this mean to a composer, other than the obvious fact that you have
to plan spacing and quality each in light of the other?  Does this pose
problems?  Certainly it can complicate some situations.  For example in
chorale-like, first-species counterpoint (and thus in a lot of small ensemble
compositions) you usually want most voices to move in small, smooth steps.
Suppose that all voices are closely spaced, forming a subminor triad.  It would
clearly be impossible to expand that subminor chord in small step-wise motion to
a major chord.  

   Still, that certainly doesn't prevent you from presenting the essential
sonority of a subminor chord moving to a major chord.  First of all, adding a
bass note at a fifth below the root of the subminor triad, doesn't change the
essential sonority of that triad very much.  That chord would then span over a
range of a major ninth, which can expand step-wise to a major tenth.  The root
of that subminor chord could even be a common tone between the two chords.
