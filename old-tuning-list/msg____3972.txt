The Hammerklaviersonate, unlikely. I don't know the exact key sizes.
The Harmoniehammerfluegel (not a harpsichord what Brian said) has rows
of short white keys which are above one another in a straight line.
It was not designed to play 31-tone music on! But it is not a very
practical key layout and for playing Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue 
on it, one would benefit from having very long thumbs :-).
There were only two instruments like this built. The older one that
Mozart knew doesn't exist anymore I think. However had there been a
break-out of Harmoniehammerfluegelomanie, they could have of course
made substantial improvements. It has one feature to ease playing
and that is an extra sixth row. The keys of the bottom row are connected
to other keys. Shifting a chromatic semitone is very easy.
The layout of the five upper rows is as follows:

   Fx   Gx   Ax   Bx   Cx   Dx   Ex   Fx   Gx   Ax  ...
   F#   G#   A#   B#   C#   D#   E#   F#   G#   A#  ...
   F    G    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    A   ...
   Fb   Gb   Ab   Bb   Cb   Db   Eb   Fb   Gb   Ab  ...
   Fbb  Gbb  Abb  Bbb  Cbb  Dbb  Ebb  Fbb  Gbb  Abb ...

Beethoven and Haydn have tried it out. Perhaps we may conclude that
they weren't very impressed from the fact that they didn't write any
music for it.
