Subject: Remarks in Tuning List

Thank you for the tuning list plug Ben.;-) (Copy of this note will also be
posted to tuning list)
It is amusing to see the confusion amongst the JI and tuning newbies there.
They seem to have yet to realise that they are attempting the impossible.
The contradictions and the paradoxes of JI logic are effectively demonstrated by
the Tantrum temperament toy program.
Tantrum was written by Stephen Malinowski. (510) 235-7478
smalin@well.com.
It runs on Mac and can be found from a link on the LucyTuning homepage at
http://www.ilhawaii.net/~lucy.

Instead of making any further comments about JI, nowadays my interests are
more concerned with producing music and attempting to find an effective way
to generate greater tuning precision, using the MIDI tuning dump.

BTW We have also been looking at EMagic and putting LucyTunings into the
environments for that program. At present we are again running up against
the
1/64th of a semitone tuning resolution problem, as it uses pitchbend.

If anyone has found an effective way to get the MIDI tuning dump to
generate better playback pitch resolution, please let us all know.
