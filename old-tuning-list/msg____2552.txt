   "Meaner than meantone" is a cute phrase;  I'll have to remember that.  

   I suppose it's worth pointing out Ivor Darreg's pet peave that third-comma
meantone is essentially identical with 19-tone equal-temperament (or presumably
a 12-toned subset in this case).  If I recall correctly, 19 third-comma-flat
fifths fail to close by less than 1 cent!
