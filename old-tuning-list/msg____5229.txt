   Well, that's a risk of course, but the point is one of emphasis more
than exclusiveness.  An applied major spends most of his/her time
practicing repertoire, techniques, and scales, but comparatively less on
plowing through scores deciding which particular variant of sonata form
this particular piece uses, and how that affects its impact upon us.  And
the reverse is more true of the Theory major.

   I'm inclined to think that the relative importances of Theory majors
studying patterns in the existing repertoire, and of them exploring future
possibilities, are about equal.  I'm sure that almost all of us on this
list would agree on the importance of future possibilities, but suggesting
possibilities for why existing music affects us the way it does also
provides valuable insight into future possibilities.
