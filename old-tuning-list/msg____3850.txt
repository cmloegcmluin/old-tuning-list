Subject: When? NOW!

From: curley@ucla.edu (Doren Garcia)

In Tuning Digest 876 Jon Szanto states:

I imagine that Western microtonal music (or however you would describe what
goes on here in the tuning list) will remain a fairly small circle of
cognoscenti until/unless more is done to evoke both live performance and
performable 'settings' (scores, plots, general improvisation instructions
to others, etc).

I have given this a little thought (maybe wishful thinking). Var=E9se's
predictions that noise and later recording technology would become integral
parts of music have been realized. It was in my opinion
Jimi Hendrix who was the catalyst for this integration. He was a kid with a
new type of instrument who was fooling around with feedback. Prior to this
feedback was anathema to 'good' musicians. A similar situation will
probably happen with 'tinytonality'. A kid with a computer and a midi
keyboard will mess around with transitionalizing through tunings and this
person will 'get it'. This person will then intuitively create music that
swings like mad. Everyone's minds will be blown. Musicians will not be able
to resist the resulting wave, just as the wave that the 'Well-tempered
Clavier' begot was irresistible.

Our job, should we decide to accept it, is to expose as many of these
scions to the inevitable.

I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. Personally I can hardly wait.
