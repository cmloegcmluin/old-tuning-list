Subject: Boston Microtonal Society's Newsletter

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I just got back to RSF from Houston where I not only got a strep
throat, but had to stay over an extra week to get everything done
that I had to do. Very busy, alas, so I didn't have time to socialize
as much as I wanted to.

Upon returning, I received the latest issue of the Microtome, the
newsletter of the Boston Microtonal Society. There were several
items of interest to Alternative Tuners including an interview with
Ben Johnston. On Friday, December 5, there will be a MUSIC NOW
concert at St. Paul's Church, Brookline, MA featuring works by
Ben Johnston (Alap and Progressions), Robert Kirzinger and John Mallia
performed by Salvatore Macchia, Sam Nichols, Bill Kirkley and
Susan Gall as well as improvisations by Steven Lantner on
1/6-tone keyboards and Mat Manieri on 6 string electric violin.
Call 617-491-6057 for info.

There was also an announcement of a new CD by the Joe Manieri Quartet
called IN FULL CRY to be released on ECM in December.

In February 1998, Ezra Sims' new piece TWENTY YEARS AFTER will
be performed by the Dinosaur Annex at Holy Cross College in
Worcester, MA. Call 617 482-3852 for info.

In March, Sims's IF I TOLD HIM will be performed by Mary Nessinger
and Ted Mook in Pittsburg on 3/2 at the Music on the Edge
series and on 3/12 at Merkin Concert Hall on West 67 in NYC.
Also in March, CRI will release a new CD of The Music of Ezra Sims
on the American Masters Series (CRI 784).
