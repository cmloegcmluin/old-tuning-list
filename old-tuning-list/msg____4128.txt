Subject: all of you as resources

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I am adding tutorials from outside authors (i.e. y'all) to the 
microtonal link on my web page, and would welcome contributions from any 
tuning digest subscribers. I could use, for example, a description of 
88cet, a history of Chinese tuning, an article on the physiology and 
psychology of audio illusions, etc. If you have something to say on a 
tuning subject you care about, why not submit it to me at
jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu
and I will include it as a link. I will be storing it as html in my 
directory to increase access speed, although I will be glad to link to it 
in your directory if you prefer. 
	I will continue to copy and post letters to this forum as I see 
fit (it seems to be common practice), but should I link to something 
you posted here and you do not want it on my web page, please notify me, 
and I will remove it.

	Also, thank you all for the nominations for microtonal 
masterpieces suitable for initiating the uninitiated.
