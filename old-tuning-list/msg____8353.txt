Subject: New Film with Microtonal Score

From: <KIBADACHI@aol.com>

Just wanted to bring to your attention a new Warner Brothers film called WHY
DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE for which I wrote the music underscore.  Most of the
score is 12tet but there are a good number of places in the film where I used
a 23 tone scale based on the Fibonacci series.  Often times tetrads were
pulled out of this scale and laid over 12tet passages.  I also used in 2
places (about 3/4 of the way into the movie) a JI scale
(16-18-20-171-24-27-28-32) in a blues-oriented piece for large rhythm section,
string quartet, and violin section.  It's a fun movie.  Hope you all get a
chance to see it.  Opens August 28th in major theatres nationwide.
Xenharmonically yours,
Stephen James Taylor
