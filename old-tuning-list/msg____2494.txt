Subject: Tuning reading

Computer Music Journal vol. 11, #1 is a special issue on microtonality,
including Carlos' "Tuning: at the crossroads", Larry Polansky's article on
Paratactical tuning, and a review of Xenharmonic keyboards by Doug Kieslar,
then at CCRMA, currently at MuscleFish.  Kieslar's article mentions the
tonality diamond and JI matrices, although not Wilson's extentions to it
specifically.  The cover has a computer-generated drawing of a lush garden,
very appropriate for the subject of tuning.  I'd also like a reference to
Erv's augmentation- possibly a back issue of 1/1 or Interval?
