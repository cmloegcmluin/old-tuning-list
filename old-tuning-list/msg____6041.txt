Subject: JI vs. ET

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

By the way, Dave Hill recently did a semiformal study of preferences
between just intonation and equal-temperament, the subjects being a set of
junior-high and high-school band-campers at Florida State University.  He
had more than a thousand respondents.  Some of you might be interested in
asking him more details on his findings.  They struck me as interesting,
and I took the same test as well.

   Here's my short summary from reading his reports (although you should
probably hear it from Dave himself):
1.  Across all responses, there was a strong preference for ET,
2.  Among those who scored highest on the raw pitch-acuity section of the
    test, there was strong preference for JI.  (The pitch acuity section had
    a series of pairs of tones separated by a comma, 13 cents, a quarter
    comma, and a skhisma, and the respondents were asked to state whether the
    second pitch was lower or higher than the first.)
3.  Many of those who preferred JI seemed to have more specific reasons, and
    just generally more thoughtful responses.

   His study also included comments about the nature of their preference
either way - whether they preferred it, for example, for having a "richer
sound".

   Dave Hill's address is "ascend11@aol.com".
