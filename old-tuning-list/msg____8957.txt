From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Bob Gilmore's Partch bio turns up an interesting bit in a letter from
1950.  Contrary to the Jon Szanto position regarding the substitution of a
sythesizer for the chromelodeon.  Mr. Szanto, I move for you to strike
from the record (e.g. your web site) this unfair statement.  The web
site reads: "If Mr.Reinhard has used a syth, then he has either
ignored or simply not comprehended a Partch truism..."

Partch writes in February to Lauriston Marshall (on p. 190 of the Gilmore
book) "I shall use the Chromelodeon very little from now on; its
musicality doesn't satisfy me, though it is indispensible from the
standpoint of theory..."the need either for an electronic tone or a reed 
made out of some alloy less susceptible to temperature changes than
brass."

On April 6 Partch and Marshall won a Guggenheim Award for "studies toward
the development of an electronic instrument with electronic tone and
manual keyboard."  (Gilmore p. 191)

What do y'all think?  Should I be impeached?
