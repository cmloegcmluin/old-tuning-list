Subject: where do the 5ths go?

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Here's something I've been thinking about lately...it's known that 
the spiral of 5ths has been explored pretty well over the last few 
thousand years, and by mathematically "bringing down" cycles of 5ths, we 
obtain patterns of notes for an octave...no problem. But, there's 
something wrong with that. Those 5ths that we mathematically alter...we 
are not HEARING them in their proper place in the Universe. They are 
actually sounding at some frequency well beyond our hearing. So, just 
where are they, then? They must be doing something, somewhere...they do 
exist, and are a part of the original fundamental sound that created 
them. Scales built from these spirals are artificial, in a sense.
Understanding this endless spiral of harmonics is one thing on paper, 
another in the world of Sound. If a "frequency" is out of the hearing of 
human ears, is it perhaps affecting other parts of the being instead? Can 
sound (and we know it can) have physiological effects that are 
involuntary? How about spiritual effects? What if we heard a scale in the 
actual pitch range of all the notes, instead of them being altered, moved 
around, sort of? Are there beings somewhere who can hear a wider range 
than we do? We know dogs, and I'm sure other animals as well, hear sounds 
we do not...we also know stars, planets, etc, are all sending out 
zillions of frequencies, well beyond our seeing or hearing. How, I 
sometimes wonder, can we draw all of these different concepts together 
and absorb them into a kind of music that could heal planets?

On a related note, Ben Johnson's comments about our society and harmful 
music are well taken...of course, it's a big subject, and can make one 
think of related topics. There are numerous societies with "out of tune"
musical systems, such as gamelan music...what's going on there, because 
they seem rather peaceful as cultures, in general. Obviously, the INTENT 
of the music is crucial...if you had just intonation music that promoted 
satanism, I don't suppose that would do anyone any good, either. And, 
what about the feeling that the performer/composer attempts to 
communicate with this music in unnatural tunings? Does that help 
balance the out of tuneness of the system? But, we are a screwed up 
bunch, in a lot of ways, and I don't think the pop/rock scene is helping 
much at all. And, the inharmonious vibrations of all that loud, out of 
tune music: I can see how that phenomenon could be harmful to people. I 
sure don't let my kid watch much TV, for the same reason. There is much 
low level nonsense in our world today. As far as music and drugs, yes, 
there's always been a lot of pot/alcohol/cocaine/heroin use in 
music...but, I just read a couple of articles about Prozac and Ridilyn, 
and an awful lot of non musicians are using these as well, including our 
poor little kids, who are being drugged at school to help calm them down 
and make them pay attention and be better students...scary stuff, a 
nightmare to me. Our whole culture is drug ridden, not to mention all the 
antibiotics we get in our system from cows milk. I truly believe that 
music is one of the most powerful forces in the world...sounds like 
Johnson does, too. That's why the math is fun and all, but the sound is 
the real deal...and it sure does affect all beings that it 
touches...Hstick
