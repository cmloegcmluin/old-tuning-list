Subject: RE: definition of JI

From: Mmcky@aol.com

I guess it's pretty well accepted that JI tuning is tuning using
small whole number frequency ratios.  The difficult part is
defining small.

I guess no one would be surprised that my approach to the matter
is based, in part, on the Least Common Multiple.  The other part
is absolute frequency.

The LCM of tones sounded simultaneously, together with the
absolute frequency determine the length of patterns in the sound
in the time domain.

I think the ear/brain as the ability to remember what is heard
for a certain length of time and remember it in great detail. 
When the patterns in the sounds are comfortably within that
length of time, the ear/brain experiences the "pleasure" of
easily decoding the patterns.

As length of time it takes to reapeat the sound patterns
approaches the capacity of the sound memory, the ear/brain has
difficulty decoding the patterns, and we register that difficulty
as distress, or dissonance.

Some patterns actually take a very long time to repeat, but
include smaller patterns that are not actually alike, but are
very nearly alike.  The ear can decode these patterns easily, and
also registers the fact that they are not exactly alike.  This,
of course, is a description of tempered music.

But here we have a possible physiological basis for a definition
of small.  Small would be when the ear can easily decode the
pattern.  Large would be when the ear can't decode the pattern.
