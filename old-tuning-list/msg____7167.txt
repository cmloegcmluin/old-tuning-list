Brian,

If you don't want to reinvent the wheel you should review existing
programs that do this. Graham Breed, Kami Rousseau and I among others
have written software along these lines. My program, Scala, offers the
most features.

There are many different microtonal notation systems each with their
advantages and disadvantages. With a fixed scale, one can use scale
degree numbers. Or one can notate a pitch explicitly in cents. But
it's usually more convenient to use note names with accidentals. In my
program there is support for several notation systems with a small
set of accidentals like # and b for semitone, / and \ for comma,
and ) and ( for diesis. There's no graphic input however, text files
or MIDI files are used for input.
Then you can give a pitch like "F#.1" where 1 stands for one octave
above middle C. The value it represents will depend on the notation
system chosen and the nearest pitch to this value in the input scale
will be used. This enables use of different tunings with the same
input file, and even use of different notation systems to a certain
extent.
