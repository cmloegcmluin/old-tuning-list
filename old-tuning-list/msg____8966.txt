Thanks for the quality scans, Manuel!  Do you know the keyboard layout of
the Harmoniehammerflugel?  Looks like Janko-Fokker.  And what kind of
instrument is it?  Looks like a piano!  In any case, is this instrument
playable?  Do you know if the force required to move the keys increases
towards the back rows?
