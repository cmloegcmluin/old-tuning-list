Subject: Why ET-x?

From: DFinnamore@aol.com

Excuse me if this question sounds a bit ignorant.  I expected to find
discussions mostly of just tuning issues on this list, but there seems to be
as much discussion of various ET scales.  This puzzles me.  We've been stuck
with a handful of pitch "islands," to use Brian Eno's term, for a few hundred
years now.  Finally, technology is giving us keyboards with virtually
continuous pitch possibilities, allowing us to produce music that is more
consistent with natural principles (acoustics, psycho-acoustics, etc.).  Why
continue exploring various equal temperaments?  What is the value in it?
 Please understand, I'm not registering a complaint or leveling a criticism;
I just don't know what the heck's the dang big deal with ETs.  Myself, I'm
glad to be rid of the dern varmints.  But I'd be fascinated to see a good
apology (justification) in favor of them.
