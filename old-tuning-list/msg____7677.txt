That's fair--you could, say, choose tunings where the roundoff error was
at most half the distance to the other alternative, which would result
in a cutoff consistency level of--uh--3/2, I think.  Still, by and large
I think consistency levels make much more sense as integers, since they
correspond to secondary, tertiary, etc. intervals being represented
consistently.  Why I care that they are, well, see below.

Okay, so the question is, why would I care, for example if I was working
in 5-limit harmony, about how 9/8s or 10/9s are approximated, but not
any intervals involving 7?

Short answer: voice-leading.

Medium-length answer: I wish to approximate just intervals not merely in
isolated chords, but in the progression of one chord to another.
Representing the movement of one consonant identity to another without
producing (what are to me) bizarre perceptual artifacts requires level-2
consistency.

Long answer, with example: let's take this forum's favorite whipping
boy, 12TET.  It's consistent to the 9-limit, so it ought to be okay for
some septimal harmony, yes?  Let's take a 4:5:6:7 tetrad and move to
another 4:5:6:7 tetrad so that the 6 of the first tetrad becomes the 7
of the second.  If we voice everything so that all voices move as little
as possible, the 7 of the first moves down by a 64/63, the 6 holds, the
5 moves up by a 36/35, and the 4 moves up by a 15/14.  (Okay, so the
second tetrad is really in "first inversion" becoming 5:6:7:8.)

How is this represented in 12TET?  A 4:5:6:7 tetrad has 4, 3, 3, and 2
steps between the members.  If the first tetrad is rooted on 0 and the
second keeps the common tone, we have 0 4 7 10 moving to 1 4 7 9.  IOW,
the 64/63 is represented by 1 step, the 36/35 by 0 steps, and the 15/14
by 1 step.  To me, this doesn't make sense--since there's a common tone,
we should be able to hear the 8/7, 6/5, and two 7/6s relative to it
fairly accurately.  Why should the 36/35 vanish when the much smaller
64/63 doesn't?  But while I'm worrying about these rather large odd
numbers, ratios involving (say) 11 never entered into it.

I realize full well that these sorts of oddities are rich ground to
explore; indeed, a major part of Easley Blackwood's _12 Microtonal
Etudes_ springs from exploiting them.  However, personally, my goals are
different.
