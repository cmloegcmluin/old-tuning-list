Subject: To Gary, Paul E, Re: non-octave scales

From: "Enrique Moreno" <eig@ccrma.stanford.edu>

I don't know how to put this in sufficiently modest terms, but you guys
MUST obtain a copy of my doctoral dissertation, which deals with the
expanded chroma phenomenon and the three-dimensionality of pitch cognition.
A series of experiments indicate that, under certain strict conditions (in
which the partial structure of the tones is more or less irrelevant),
powers of 3 (and possibly of 5) do replicate the smilarity condition
eliceted by powers of 2 in tonal or modal polyphony. 
	During the past months I have seen many postings touching on this topic
(particularly by Gary and Paul E.) but (I hate to put it in this terms) the
statements therein are mostly gropping in the dark. Unfortunately, I don't
have much time to participate in the list's discussions. So, do forgive any
unintended patronizing tone, call Stanford's CCRMA (415) 723 497, extension
300, ask for my diss. to be mailed to you, and get some interesting facts.
	For now, all that I can point out is that the main problem in discussing
octave equivalence and expanded chroma in any meaningful way is the
awareness of distinguishing between the psychophysical and cognitive
domains. Therein lies the confusion.
