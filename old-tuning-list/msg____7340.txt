Of course, the musicians did not think about tritones at all when tuning.   
 What they had to decide was whether the key in question would sound a C#   
or a Db.  If they had tuned it to C# and needed a Db, well, then it was   
time to retune.  No one wrote a C# and Db in the same piece (except for   
that unique John Bull fantasia discussed earlier), and collections of   
pieces were arranged by key precisely to facilitate their performance on   
the usual keyboard.  Those who got tired of retuning for the more common   
alternatives of D#/Eb and G#/Ab obtained an instrument with a 14-note   
keyboard, which was fairly common.  Handel just went farther than most -   
his organ was not an exception _in principle_.
