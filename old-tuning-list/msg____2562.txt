Subject: Re: "Mood and mode"

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

The big difference between Greek modes and Well Temperaments is that the 
Greek modes were in just intonation.  Plato, if he is on the track that 
lead to Ptolemy, conceptualized the modes in whole number ratios.  One 
would doubt that it was the other way around.

Since the Greek modes are named for different peoples before they are 
developed into double octave, fully modulating, theoretical models...I 
suspect that a short ascending or descending set of musical tones with 
imprint a sensibility that is recognizeable by a listener after some 
repitition and attention.  Perhaps a particular musical interval created 
an impression for a particular mode that share a semantic field with the 
intonation of the dialect of Greek language spoken, or with some other 
natural phenomenon.

Regarding the different moods of Well-temperament: even in 12-tone equal 
temperament, contemporary pianists and other musicians sense moods.  This 
could be because of the programs of early music played, an over emphasis 
of playing white keys over black keys on the instrument (changing the 
timbre of the over played white keys in comparison), psychological 
pigenonholing tendencies, having perfect pitch and basing a determination 
on mood upon the pitch level in begins from, synesthesia, or merely 
accepting an old argument for new materials.

Actual Well-temperament since Werckmeister III does have recognizeable 
differences in keys when compared analytically.  The further one goes in 
the cycle of fiths, the more striking the differnences.  Bach's student 
JP Kirnberger wrote of areas, or "quadrants" that are sacrosanct to 
modulation.  Paraphasing, Kirnberger wrote in 1776 that to modulate from 
one quadrant to another was to change such a dimension in the music as to 
transform it.  

Other Well-temperaments are less diverse in their 
composition, lessening recognizeability by scale.  Besides there was no 
absolute pitch concerns about where to start regarding Herz. In certain 
well-tempered keys one can well find 12-tone equal temeperament.  In 
others one can find more just and more tempered.  All well-tempered 
scales share a different distortion relationship between 5-limit just 
intonation and a cycle of 12 perfect fifths.

Ivor Darreg's declaration about indivisible factors of the octave having 
a "specific mood" goes beyond well-temperament, beyond scale.

Since the human biological ear cannot logarithmically bisect an octave 
unaided (e.g. try it with a 7/4), we cannot "hear" even 5-tone equal 
temperament, let alone 17-tone equal temperament - at first!  As a 
bassoonist, I am now quite comfortable in 5-ET, 7-ET, 19-ET, 31-ET, and 
have played professionally in 34-ET, and others.

First I tell listeners who are analyzing: don't judge the tuning by the 
style of the composer's composition.  A different person will redirect 
the materials in a completely fresh way, independendent of the materials 
themselves.  Secondly, a scale is a scaffold of tones extracted from the 
music and they must be able to hear all or most of the tonal material to 
get a "gist" of a tuning, and repeadedly or in isolation.  Thirdly, since 
we learn largely by rote (though intelectually marking them by numbers 
helps), our human logic _does_ recognize the self-same similarity of like 
intervals formed from the equally dividing an octave for reasons of music 
making.  There is a phsyical recognition of 13-tone equal temperament 
that I gained from a Theme and Variations for Homemade Instruments by 
Skip La Plante.  Easly Blackwood's 15-TET would not only be transfigured 
by a change in tuning pedigree, but Ivor Darreg's music was built to morph.
