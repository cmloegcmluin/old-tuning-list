Put it this way: although analysis of a signal into frequency components
with constant amplitude has a unique solution, analysis of a signal into
frequency components with varying amplitude doesn't. In the typical case
the variations in amplitude will be slow enough so that any inharmonic
frequencies that might come up in the latter, non-unique mode of
analysis would be too close together to be resolved by the ear. What I'm
suggesting is that the ear in fact does the latter and hears a harmonic
series with changing amplitudes, rather than inharmonicity.

Again, with the amplitude fluctuations, you can't pin the frequencies
down in a well-defined way. However, I'm saying that for wind, brass,
and bowed string instruments, it would be consistent to assume that you
have exact integer overtones with a particular amplitude spectrum for
each one (plus noise). Such an assumption would not differ from the
ear's own interpretation in any meaningful way.

The driving force has to be in phase with the reflected wave for a
resonant standing pattern to develop. In noise, there is no phase
regularity whatsoever.

Hills, yes.

No, not like a flute. A flute tone is not just selectively amplified
noise. The turbulent airflow that is responsible for the driving force
of a flute is not fully understood, but is definitely more regular than
just noise.

In the ideal of an infinitely long sampling time, the original peaks are
Dirac delta functions, while the hills of noise remain hills, so the
former are not shifted at all.

Yes!

Well, we both mentioned noise as an extraneous factor at various points
in the discussion. So the definition was implicit.

>The inharmonicity in the resonances is caused by the holes being there

As well as end effects even when all the holes are closed.
