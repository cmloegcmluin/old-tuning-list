   <Applause>  Thank you, Neil!

   I've seen this in a lot of xenharmonic music as well.  I have also seen,
in my own writing as well as some others, the opposite when it comes to
simplicity:  A composition that's made complex by carefully preplanned
structuring or formal ideas that seem clever on paper, but don't prove to
be even audible (or just simply "don't work") when performed into real
music.

   I think that the most important task to start with in xenharmonic
composition is to figure out what general sorts of music a given tuning is
most appropriate for, and then write to that idiom.  If you don't do that,
then your audience will face two questions:
1.  Why doesn't this music sound right?
2.  What was the point in using an unusual tuning here?
If you match the tuning to the style, both of those problems are
automatically solved.
