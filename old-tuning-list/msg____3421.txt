This is how I would structure a 15-week course on tunings, meeting twice a 
week, with musical examples along the way. The course would be "hands on" 
with monochords and scalatrons for all.

1. Introduce the octave as an acoustical phenomenon
2. Introduce the 3-limit consonances and Pythagorean tunings
3. Pythagorean tunings as applied to pentatonic scales: Chinese Music
4. 7-ET representations of pentatonic scales allowing modulational freedom: 
Thai music
5. Pythagorean tunings as applied to the heptatonic scale: Organum
6. Discuss the pythagorean comma; introduce 12-ET representations of the 
heptatonic scale
7. Non-just non-equal-tempered scales: African and much other music
8. Introduce the 5-limit consonances
9. Schismatic tuning of late middle ages and medieval Arabic tuning as 
Pythagorean approximations to the 5-limit
10. Just intonation: Indian music (I've heard some santoor music where the 
intonation is very clearly just 5-limit).
11. Discuss the syntonic comma; introduce meantone temperament: Renaissance 
music
12. Equal-tempered versions of meantone -- 31, 19, is 12 good enough?
13. Circulating temperaments/well temperament: Bach and "key colors"
14. 12-TET becomes standard :( , Arabic music measured and played in 
"quarter-tones"
15. Equal tempered versions of just intonation: 53, 34, maybe compare 
22-equal with 22 sruti of Indian music to show how JI structures are 
preserved
16. Atonality, set theory, Balzano and 20-TET and other numerological 
constructs.
17. Introduce the 7-limit consonances
18. Augmented sixth chords as meantone approximations to the 7-limit
19. Introduce the 9- and 11-limit consonances in JI: Partch, Johnston, etc.
20. Equal-tempered representations of higher consonances: Huygens, Fokker, 
and 31; Herf, Sims and 72, proposals of 41-tone and 171-tone equal 
temperaments
21. Inharmonic timbres, tunings to go with them: Gamelan music, modern 
explorations
22. Non-octave scales in history and modern non-octave tunings such as 
Pierce's 13 per 3:1
23-30. Creative ensemble projects
