Subject: Kuhnle tapes?

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Does anyone have a source for copies of the tapes made in the 1950's by
Wesley Kuhnle with the title _A History of Tuning_?

I heard this at some point in the 70's. Despite some technical and musica=
l
problems and some now-questionable conjectures, it remains a landmark in
historical performance practice and I would be very curious to hear it
again.  =
