Subject: Harmony and Rhythm

G'day all

One day I was thinking about low notes and made the connection between
rhythm and frequency.  If we are in C and suppose C=256 Hz to make it
easy on the calculations, then we have more Cs at 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 etc
except that this is too low for hearing.  However 8, 4, 2, 1 Hz are
equivalent to tempos of 480, 240, 120 and 60 bpm.  So if a piece is
played in C at a tempo of 120 bpm then we can say that the tempo/rhythm
is IN TUNE with the key.

Because I have this idea that after every few octaves a fifth should be
thrown in, I consider that the frequency of the key note should be
either 2^n or 3*2^n times the tempo (when converted from bpm to Hz).
In either of these cases I would say that the composer got it right.

I had a look at a number of classical composers to see whether they did
this or not and found that the good composers generally did.  Some of
the not so good ones didn't.  Of course sometimes we are stuck with a
tempo in words and don't know the exact rate.

I had a look at a few modern composers.  I like Billy Joel and he writes
definite things like 124 bpm and leaves you with no doubt.  Well I
checked his pieces and they are in tune but there is a 2% to 2.5%
difference which would be removed if A=440 was changed to A=450.
So does anyone know whether he tunes his instruments to 450?  That would
explain things.  If not then I think that he is picking up the natural
earth frequencies and that A=450 is the natural rate.

If it can be accepted that having the tempo and key matching is a sign
of good music then it is also true that transpositions are not a good
practice.  If you transpose a piece up by a third then to keep the
balance you would need to play it 25% faster and it would sound like the
chipmunks!  Any chance of conveying (the right) emotions would be gone.

OK, so all shoot me down in flames again!

There is an article on WWW (link on my pages) about a similar idea.
That is, that chords slowed down become rhythm and that certain common
chords make common drum beats etc.  For example, a fifth becomes:

Low note   x     x     x     x     x
High note  *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Result     #   * x *   #   * x *   #

More complicated chords become more interesting beats.
