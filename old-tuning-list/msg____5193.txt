Are you the Clough who co-wrote with Rowell the article on early Indian 
scales and recent diatonic theory in _Music Theory Spectrum_? The article 
showed that "second-order-maximal-evenness," along with one other property, 
was sufficient to define the four rotationally distinct gramas of early 
Indian theory. Well, I accidentally discovered that a slightly different 
(but no more complex) definition of second-order-maximal-evenness is 
sufficient to give you the gramas without invoking any additional 
properties. If you are interested, I will discuss this definition.

Incidentally, I believe the gramas resulted from tuning pure thirds and 
fifths, which were then reckoned in terms of 22 degrees, which can be 
explained in many ways. I don't find plausible the argument that the 22 
degrees were a "universe" from which the scales were chosen. Nonetheless, if 
one goes down that path, there is an easier derivation of the gramas than 
that in your paper.
