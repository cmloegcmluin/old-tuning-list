Subject: marion tuning resolution

From: ice777@cdsnet.net (Michael Vannice)

When I posted that the tuning resolution of Marion Systems MSR-2 and
ProSynth was 1/512 of a semitone, I was taking the word of my owner's manual
and also of Jim Aikin's review of the MSR-2 in Keyboard, February, 1995,
pp.124-125, in which he writes: 
   "We can recommend the MSR highly to musicians who want to make use of
alternate tunings. Each ASM module stores four complete 128-note tuning
tables. Each patch is stored with one of the tables already selected (or
with equal temperament). The tuning resolution is an astonishing 512
increments per half-step, or about .2 cent.
   "Just as astonishing: In tests with a stripped-down test tone patch, we
could hear that that fine resolution really existed, and was stable from one
hardware voice to another. When we played a two-note interval and adjusted
the intonation of one of the notes, we could hear the rate of beating
between overtones increasing very gradually." 
   I haven't done any testing of my own. But regardless of the actual
resolution, I do enjoy having four user-tuning tables in an analog sound module.
