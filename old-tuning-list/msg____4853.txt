Melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre, and location
--the basic parameters of music--have varying relative 
priority in various musics. There are also musics
(like some Stochausen [sp?]) which attempt to blur 
these categories.

That's a big "if" there. Even assuming the most innocuous
and supposedly intuitive-for-Westerners diatonic JI scale: 
1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1, as a basis for the various
et and other approximations, you see different-sized whole 
steps. 

We are the final arbitors of our own music, you and I.
My music uses as many intervals and pitch classes as I 
want, melodically and harmonically. Yours uses what you
want. If you want to get into discussing what others
do in practice, I'm sure I can produce examples of "comma 
shifts" in melody, accompanied and unaccompanied: Bartok's 
field notations; lead singers in pop music who 
(consistently, not accidentally) use for certain passages 
pitches not available from the fixed-pitch accompanying 
instruments; blues singers and blues players, jazz players 
like Miles Davis, who purposely use different fingerings
to produce pitches near the "normal" ones; string quartets; 
barborshop quartets; etc. 

The only times you'll probably hear equal-sized whole
steps and no comma shifts in melody will be on fixed-
pitch instruments or from performers rigorously trained
to match such instruments. (I read, I think in Helmoholtz, 
about the comparative difficulty of solfege students to 
stay in tune as a group when accompanied by the (et) 
church organ and ease when unaccompanied and allowed
to sign in JI.)

Comma shift is probably a misnomer too (like "wandering tonic"). 
I'd rather think of it not as a "shift" to a different version 
of the same pitch class, but a movement to a new pitch class.

Maybe there's a psychological transistion or grey area
between when "shifts" become "new classes". In other 
words, maybe historically (following scale-expansion 
theories like Yasser's) new pitches were added as 
"shifts", but over time became distinct "classes". For 
example, if you were composing in a diatonic C Major 
scale and were inspired to use a V7 of the relative minor 
(E7), the G# might initially be thought of as a "shift" 
of the psychological grouping "fifth of scale" rather
than a new class. In fact, our notation system still 
shows the fossil remains of such thought in the very name 
"G#" (one of 7 letter names plus a "shift" command, rather 
than having 12 letter names with no shift commands).

Interesting. Do you have a formula?

Technically, "we" includes me, so we are talking about
both issues.

Is your dissonance function not applicable to comparing
perfect representations of different intervals? (I guess
it would give equal dissonance, 0, for both?)
