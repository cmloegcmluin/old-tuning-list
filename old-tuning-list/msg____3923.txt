Subject: Kameoka & Kuriyagawa

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

K&K are Kameoka and Kuriyagawa. Their work differs from Plomp's
and Levelts's in that they consider all possible pairs of partials and
refer to a more complex model of perception based on Stevens's concept 
of a prothetic continuum. Their algorithm entails a great deal more
computation than P&L's and requires taking powers and roots with
fractional exponents. However, the results are similar to those of
the P&L algorithm -- pairs of partials within a critical bandwidth
interact and are dissonant, SPL matters, and pitches more than
an octave apart barely contribute to the overall "dissonance power."

Whether it is more accurate than P&L's isn't known, but the latter 
seems to work just fine in practice.

Their principal paper is the one below; Part 1 dealt with sine waves 
and the theoretical basis for their work. It immediately preceded this
one in the same volume of JASA. They also published a couple of abstracts
and some short summaries in Japanese. I have no idea what they are
doing now or whether they continued this research, which was done at
a company.
