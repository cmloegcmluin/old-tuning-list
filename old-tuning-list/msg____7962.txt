Subject: The tuning formerly know as...

From: <DFinnamore@aol.com>

Hi, tuning friends!

I've been just lurking awhile, but still doing lots of tuning explorations.
There's a set of tunings that I recently began to explore, and like a lot,
that I can't come up with a good name for.  Maybe somebody out there could
help me out.  I doubt that I'm the first person to try this method of tuning
generation; some sort of nomenclature has probably been given by someone.  If
not, could one of you math gurus tell me the accepted terminology for the
mathematical method I'm using?  The tunings, which are simply non-repeating,
theoretically infinite sets of harmonically related tones, are generated
thusly:

1) Begin with any integer.
2) Add 1 to it
3) Add 2 to the result
4) Add 3 to the result of that
and so on until you have enough tones to satisfy you, fill up your
instrument's tuning table, or exceed the limits of human hearing <g>

An example would be

27, 28, 30, 33, 37, 42, 48, 55, 63, 72, 82, 93, ...

Of course, you could also subtract instead of adding but I haven't tried that
yet.  These tunings really stretch the ear without ever clashing in the way
that ET intervals can.  I find that I have to be careful not to use too many
tones at once; working gradually up and down the set sounding 3 to 6 adjacent
tones at a time seems to work best.  The results tend to sound remarkably
modern while being neither grindingly dissonant nor neoclassical sounding.
Remarkably, the organization of the tones seems clear to the ear.

Well, enough promotion of my latest fascination, whatever it's called.

Thanks!
