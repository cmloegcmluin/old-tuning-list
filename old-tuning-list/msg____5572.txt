The problem is that we count passing time in two ways. One way is for
birthdays - we count years completed as discreet units (except as children
when we enthusiastically noted the half year completed as well). The other
way of counting applies to calendars. Days, months, and years are
identified in terms of periods of time, and any moment within each of these
periods recieves that identification. By your birthday-style counting,
today would be 31 May 1996 (as I write it is 1 June 1997) because these are
the last full day, month, and year completed. Would you even go further and
call this the first millenium - because we have not yet completed the
second? Your interval-counting example is a good one. The common pitch class
notation with numbers does use 0, however, as the value for unisons, so
that intervals in the system can be added without subtracting 1. 0 in this
case is exactly like that moment when years 1 BC and AD met - it has no
magnitude. The value 0 is not always meaningful for musical purposes, however.
Consider a harmonic series over the fundamental n. The series goes: (1n,
2n, 3n ...). In terms of frequency, 0n (Zero n) is undefined.
Unfortunately, one notation frequently used by practicing musicians
considers 2n to be the ''first flageolet'' - in effect, your birthday
notation - which leads to real confusion in reading scores where the actual
pitch is not notated.  Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
