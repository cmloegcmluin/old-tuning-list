I've got my guitar refretted now, with the pattern I said I was
going to use.  That is 19.5 frets per octave, with a fifth of
696.5 cents, so near enough 1/4 comma meantone.  I used mandolin
wire for the whole neck and it does just about work.  Maybe a few
filed down guitar frets near the nut would have been better.

It's a lot easier to play for not having a full 31 note scale.
I'm glad I ignored that suggestion.  I can play A major with the
normal fingering.  It works!  There are also a few 7:9:11 chords
which sound good with distortion.

One problem with the fretting pattern is that I can't play the
septimal version of the "Hendrix chord" in Purple Haze.  I have
tried tuning the strings down to give both versions proposed. The
sound is more like a normal chord, but less like the CD. It does
need distortion to sound right, BTW.  Also, Foxy Lady doesn't
include a chord like this according to my book.  All the notes are
used within a measure, but not at the same time.  This my be a
guitar player's chord, but an interpretation from the harmonic
series is irrelevant.
