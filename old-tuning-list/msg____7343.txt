Another Quick Break from Interval-Hearing:
- Nomenclatural quiz to identify the pitches that form off-octave
  intervals.  (First identifying these intervals upward then
  downward.)
- Similarly for off-double-octaves (upward only).

Back to Interval-Hearing:
- A brief practice listening then singing major sixths, brief since
  they're pretty close to traditional major sixths.
- A brief practice at 7:4 subminor sevenths, brief since we worked
  with them earlier.
- A brief practice with major ninths, brief since they're pretty close
  to traditional.
- Neutral sevenths (11:6) listening then singing.
- Neutral ninths (15:7) listening then singing.

Quoting Harmonic-Series-Fragment Chords:
- "Repeat after me the sequence of intervals in a harmonic-series-
  fragment chord".
- Interval-sequence quiz.
- Quiz to quote them by pitch names.
- Harmonic chord sing-along (if possible - difficult because of wide
  range).

Quiz:  Distinguishing Harmonic- and Subharmonic-Series Block Chords.

Melodic Exercise - The Biggie:  Note-Stream Identification:
  Play a long series of notes, and I am to identify each note in the
  sequence, one-by-one, knowing the pitch of the previous note, and
  hearing the pitch-difference of the next note from the previous.

Third-Stack Chords:
- Listen to stacks of three, four, five, and six neutral thirds.
- Listen to stacks of three, four, and five supramajor thirds.

Chord-Type Distinction:
  "Listen to the following block chords, and tell me if they are
  harmonic-series-fragment, subharmonic-series-fragment, neutral-third-
  stack, or supramajor-third stack chords.
