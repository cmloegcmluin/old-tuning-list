   I'll address Steve's other thoughts shortly, but I just wanted to
address this terminological question quickly.  

   Although this tuning ... "discrepancy" I suppose it could be called ...
arrives from the same sort of mechanism as a (syntonic) comma error in JI,
Ivor Darreg, and probably others, referred to this it as a "pseudocomma"
for two reasons:  
1.  The size of the discrepancy is much larger, especially in the case of 
    22TET (somewhat less so in the case of same effect in 34TET), than a
21.5c
    real syntonic comma.  In 53TET, however, this is not the case at all.  
2.  A real comma scenario can give rise to an (theoretically) indefinitely
    large sequence of pitch changes.  That is easiest to see in the
wandering
    tonic case:  If in the JI scenario you let the tonic drop by a syntonic
    comma and repeat that progression over and over each time dropping by 
    81:80, you'll never quite creep down to precisely any pitch within the 
    original "source scale" (as Steve aptly called it).  In the case of
22TET
    or 34TET on the other hand, you'll never create any pitches that are
not
    already in within your original set of 22 or 34 pitch classes.  
I personally agree that these important-enough reasons to merit using the
term "pseudocomma" instead of comma.  Others may disagree or maybe not.
