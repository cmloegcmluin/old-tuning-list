Great. The play of deviation from gestalts is present in music as in other
arts. Musical tension or at least aural interest is produced by slight 
deviation from the gestalt just intervals. People like a little phasing 
sometimes. Your idea of changing the temperament throughout a piece to 
increase and decrease this tension adds a level of expression. Nice.

Your response resonates with the point I was trying to make, which is that
one should choose pitches because they are the exact pitches required to 
produce the desired musical effect, and not because they are the closest 
available pitches drawn from an arbitrary set, such as from 41-et when 
what you really wanted was 9-limit (Partch sense) JI. For your adjustable
meantone, the pitches are neither JI nor et, but are the exact pitches 
needed for the musical effect.

This raises another interesting subtopic. I never understood why people consider
commas a problem in pure JI. I think rather the idea of a "scale" as a limiter 
of pitch choices is the problem. Each just triad has its ideal pitches. Commas 
are not a problem in just triadic music if you allow yourself to use the pitches 
required by the triads, and not try to fake them with pitches from a small 
predetermined (say diatonic or chromatic) set. I personally like the sound of a 
slight pitch adjustment in an inner voice corresponding with a change in harmonic 
context. I find it almost a spiritual affirmation as the subtle correction is 
made; it sounds so right.
