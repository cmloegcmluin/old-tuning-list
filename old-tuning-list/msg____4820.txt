   Can you show us any specific evidence that this maps to partials of any
pitch from any instrument instrument more accurately than integer
multiples?  Or is the closeness of the mapping not your main point?

   Are you sure that "consonant" is the best choice of words here?  Would
you for example view a major second (two fifths apart) as more consonant
than a major sixth (three fifths apart)?  

   "Consonant" is probably a good term in one sense but not another:  Since
consonance REALLY means closeness to resolution to the tonic in a tonal
system (despite its common but technically incorrect usage as more or less
the opposite of "discordant"), closeness on the circle of fifths (spiral or
whatever) is a pretty good measure of closeness to the tonic in a tonal
system.  But it's probably not a very good measure of consonance in thee
sense of discord (for the reason I suggested above).  Discord is another
way in which a harmony can sound farther from resolution.
