Thank you for your thoughts. From a practical standpoint, whatever I
should
produce as proof, in terms of instruments, experiments, data etc.
I have too strong a vested interest in "proving" that Harrison was
correct.
Hence whatever further experiments, I should set up, few would
believe me.
 
I published details of his equations, and how they can be applied to
musical instruments, about ten years ago, and since then, with
others,
have been making music and recordings using the technology.
 
We come down to the problem of all "scientific" hypothesis logic,
that a
"Law" is only valid, until someone comes up with a better "Law".
In this case the prevailing "Law" is a mapping of harmonics based on
exact integer frequency ratios, and the proposed hypothesis is a
mapping 
based on pi, as very clearly described by Harrison and at our
websites.
 
As I have yet to afford a full equipped acoustic lab, (neither in UK
or
here in Hawaii), the comparisons are difficult to make except on an
experiential level.
 
I missed the posting in alt.sci.physics.acoustics that you reposted.
Thank you, I access newsnet via tymnet, then bix-to-cix via telnet 
and sometimes things get lost on the way, from my impatience with 
the delays and slow echos.
 
 
Re: The question about Yamaha DX/TX microtunable gear.
I have a list of YAM figures for many of the tunings and a table of
the values for LucyTuning.
