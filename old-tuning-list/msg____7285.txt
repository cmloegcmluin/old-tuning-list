Subject: Meantone and Well-Temperaments

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

A couple of comments re Meantone and "Well-Temperament":

Because the chromatic and diatonic semitones are of different 
sizes, different meantone keys should sound subtlely different 
even if their principal triads are tuned the same when one plays 
all 12 tones. This should be true to a greater or lesser extent 
for all varieties of meantone short of 12-tet itself. Perhaps
these melodic differences were part of the alleged "affections."

The late Peter Yates, building on the work of Wesley Kuhnle,
described well-temperaments as irregular systems. According
to his rather vague descriptions, one started with 1/4-comma
meantone and adjusted the fifths until one could play in all
keys. Thus one would obtain a type of circulating temperament
with a variety of 5th and thirds.

J.M. Barbour took this idea to its rational conclusion with his
"Tuning by Regularly Varied Fifths," where one started by tuning
the fifth D-A to about 697 cents and increased the size as one
went around the circle in both directions with the widest fifth, 
Ab-Eb having 703 cents. The thirds ranged from 392 cents to 408.
Barbour posited a linear increment of 0.16666.. cents, but one
could experiment with other increments, wider ranges, non-linear
steps, etc.

My recollection is that when this topic came up on the list a couple
of years ago, the consensus of people who had tried it was that
it is too subtle an effect to be worth the trouble of tuning it
accurately and that meantone or one of the less extreme historical
temperaments is adequate for performing Baroque music.

I might add that Augusto Novaro claimed the several of his mildly 
stretched and shrunk 12-tone tempered octave tunings were were 
perceptibly different and worth trying.
