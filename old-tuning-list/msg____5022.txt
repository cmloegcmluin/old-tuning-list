This is true.  The exact theoretical Schumann frequency is 7.49 Hz but
it certainly is not a steady hum.

Use 300 Hz, that fits in with both and the earth resonance :-)

My information comes from the book "An Introduction to the Study of
Indian Music" by E Clements 1912.  Note that there are 7 different
frequencies used for ni depending on the harmonic meaning.  Clements
uses a very nice notation (I don't know if this is standard) with flats
that have a little 7 in them for the 7/4 ratio ones (Hi Robert  :-)
See the diagram at http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/in_music.gif
which shows all the notes and the harmonic relationships including
ratios of 2, 3, 5 and 7.  The ni I refer to is the ni natural.
This may explain the points made by Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>.

It may be that this is just a typical scheme and that others also exist.
I don't know about that, but the detail and consistency of Clements
scheme is very sound to me.  Note that the diagram is not his structure
just the note names and frequencies.

However in my bid for A=450 I have yet to play my master card...  Billy
Joel!  I will write a post about Harmony and Rhythm which will explain
this.
