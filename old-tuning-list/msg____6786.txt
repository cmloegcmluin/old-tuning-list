_My_ candid opinion, speaking as one who has been on the tuning list
since 1994 and has been using various electronic discussion fora for
about a decade before that, is that the above paragraph describes Mr.
Gibson far better than Mr. Erlich.  There is no surer method to
establish oneself as a clueless newbie than to burst onto an existing
list or newsgroup, flood it with one's "superior knowledge", be
surprised and offended when it is not instantly and gratefully received,
and put down respected members of far longer standing who have problems
with it.
