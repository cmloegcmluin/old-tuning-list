That's indeed an interesting question, perhaps someone better acquainted 
with HP could answer the other details.  As far as tuning is concerned, 
Johnston recounted that he composed alone, and not in his head--he would 
sit at the instruments and plunk around until an idea came that was not 
only musically adequate, but idiomatic for the instrument.  I understand 
that Glenn Hackbarth wrote a dissertation on Daphne of the Dunes, which 
concludes that instrumental performance ease outweighed JI theory, one 
which I think is well justified i most works; perhpas Oedipus, The 
Letter, and some of the Intrusions are the exceptions in which just 
intonation is the dominant force in composition.  Also notable is that 
the kitharas and HCs, as time progressed, were tuned less for ease of 
producing just-intervals and more for expressionistic reasons.
