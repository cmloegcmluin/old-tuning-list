Subject: Greetings to all

From: Marc Holbert <holberm1@alpha.lasalle.edu>

Greetings to all on this list.

This is--rather obviously--my first post to this list, to which I've been 
subscribed off and on for a few months now.  I try as best I can to 
follow the discussions on here, but I'm sad to state that it's all 
entirely over my head.  I have been playing piano and guitar for quite a 
few years now, and am interested in broadening my playing scope, which is 
why I subscribed to this list originally.  Unfortunately, the discussions 
are aimed more towards the advanced, seasoned composer, and leave very 
little room for beginners who want to learn about this seemingly 
interesting side of music composition (note this is not a criticism, 
rather my perception of the goings-on). 

I'm wondering if any of the list members would be able to give me a 
slight introduction to the discussions of just intonation, microtonality, 
etc., or perhaps a pointer to a web site or other resource where I could 
learn more about this.  It would probably be best to e-mail me privately, 
so as not to disturb the discussions on the list.  

I'm very excited to hear from someone who can basically get my feet wet 
in this field.  I'm not asking for a semester-long course on the subject, 
which I'm sure no one has the time for, rather some sort of introduction 
that would help me understand these concepts.  Perhaps by showing 
comparisons to more basic musical theory that I would be familiar with 
could be a start.  

Anyway, if there's anyone on this list that would be gracious enough to 
give me a little hand in the matter, please send me an e-mail.  I know 
it's probably a long way off for me, but I'd love to contribute to the 
discussions on here, as I am and always have been an extraordinary lover 
of music.

Thank you for your time.
-Marc
