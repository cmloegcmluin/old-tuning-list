CALL FOR PROPOSALS AND MUSIC
JIM'98, Journ=E9es d'Informatique Musicale

The JIM aims to gather researchers in computer music and musicians who use
computers as a means of expression or as a tool for composition, in order to
present the most advanced researches and their development prospects.

They are organised by CNRS-LMA (Daniel Arfib) and the Atelier d'Exploration
Harmonique (AEH) with the help of ADERIM. JIM'98 will happen this year in a
residence at the Agelonde Center in la Londe-les-Maures in the south of
France along the mediterranean sea. This site is situated nearby the
railways station of Toulon and Hy=E8res and also nearby the airport of
Hy=E8res. This will allow a good conviviality in superb suroundings. The
price will be in accordance with all budgets.

Call for music works

The theme for the evening concert this year is: "the use of microtonality in
new music". JIM'98 call for music works that use microtonality (just
intonation, alternative tunings). Authors have to send a cassette, a DAT or
a CD acoompgnied with a written document specifying the title, its length
and the tuning system used. A committee will select the best propositions in
this domain
