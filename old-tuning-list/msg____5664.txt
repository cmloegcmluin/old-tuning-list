Thank you, Ed Foote, for your description of your tuning class.  It   
expands on my point that Western classical music is not based on 12TET.   
 So many posts on the list assume that getting away from 12TET requires   
getting away from that music.

When are you releasing your Beethoven in the Temperaments CD?

In early-music concerts, it is customary to identify in the program notes   
the keyboard instruments that are used (who built them, where, and when).   
 Perhaps it would help the "temperament crusade" to identify the   
temperaments as well (and not just for the keyboards, come to think of   
it).  It would encourage the audience to think about them and listen for   
the differences.

I certainly agree that the thing to do is to take music that people   
already know and enjoy and present it in other tunings - especially when   
the pieces sound so much better that way!


A couple of specific comments:

Anyone who hears it played with such wide vibrato that they can't tell   
how wide the 3rds are.  Is it just coincidence that the more prevalent   
12TET has become the more string players and singers have used vibrato?

Also, the same people will accept such thirds as will accept chamber   
music with piano and strings, using an equally-tempered piano.  In this   
case, either 1) the strings match the piano and the audience finds those   
14 cent wide 3rds just fine, or 2) the strings continue to play with more   
pure intervals (compared to each other) and the audience doesn't notice   
that they're not in tune with the piano.

In concerts that have pieces both for strings alone and for strings with   
piano, I have never heard the audience talking about the temperament(s)   
used.  I don't think most of them listen closely enough (or know what to   
listen for) to tell the difference.  Change the phrasing, though, and the   
audience will notice.

But you do seem to agree that even the performers don't realize they're   
not playing in 12TET.

I agree that it is not difficult to determine a musically appropriate   
temperament, but "works best" and "intended" are quite different things.   
 Just to mention a couple examples, what temperament did Bach intend for   
the WTC,  and what did John Bull intend for his Hexachord Fantasia?
