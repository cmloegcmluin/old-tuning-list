All-
	Yes, I suspect the best way to get a forum cd is to order from 
the microdude you know best. I have excerpts from the CD on my web page at

http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/listenforumcd.html

from all but three participants, with instructions for ordering from me 
if you like. Warren Burt, Carter Scholz and John Loffink have not yet 
given permission to post their cuts.
