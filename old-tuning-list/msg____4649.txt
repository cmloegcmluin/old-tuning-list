Hi Gary,

In Tuning Digest 961, topic 1, you wrote:

I was looking for an application to convert .WAV files to .AU myself.  It
seems like .AU works better with web browsers, but I don't know how to
create .AU files from my Windows-based system.

The "Sound Recorder" accessory supplied with Windows (SOUNDREC.EXE) provides
no way to specify properties such as sample rate, nor does it let you view
what the properties are for a given file.  ".WAV" files DO contain info such
as sample rate, though.

I just ran some tests to verify this, using an accessory supplied with my
sound card (Audio Recorder by ESS Technology).  It allowed me to specify
sampling rates from 5.5 kHz to 44 kHz.  Windows' accessory appears to record
everything as 16 bit samples at 22 kHz Mono, but is capable of playing the
other formats.
