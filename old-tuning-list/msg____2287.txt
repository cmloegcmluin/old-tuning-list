It's not a technical reason; we have a limited number of suitable pianos, 
and they are all used 24-7.  Univ. of Miami couldn't spare a piano for a 
couple of days.

Could it not be that the ambiguity caused by confounding enharmonic tones 
is the basis for traditional goal-directed motion?  His idea (as I 
understand it) is that a JI V7-I progression simpy moves from one 
consonance to another, and that the resolution is "undeserved".

By this definition, must JI music be static, or can it be founded in 
tension/resolution relationships?  La Monte Young thinks 
so, but his meditative  style of music does not inspire the adrenaline 
release that I seek in music.  I am trying  to reconcile this dichotomy.  
Certainly, one should not simply "just"-ify (pardon the pun) 
common-practice music, but seek a way to create this inspiration within 
the spirit of JI in a manner that could not be done by other means.

Whose music truly has tonal motion?
	Harry Partch's -no
	La Monte Young's -no
	James Tenney's -no
All of the other JI composers that I can think of "off the cuff" are 
imitators of either these styles or of traditional styles.  I have heard 
the JI Network compilations, and probably at least a sample of most 
harmonically progrssive music that is available on the market.  I know 
that it's a poor sampling, so feel free to laugh.  If you can recommend 
music that fills my tall order, I beg you to recommend it and tell me 
where to find it.

Perhaps a good avenue to pursue is *what does create harmonic tension in 
JI?*.  Do all of the Baroque definitions apply?  Neighbor tones may, 
only if they are not part of the same harmonic series.  Suspensions work 
well under the same conditions.
