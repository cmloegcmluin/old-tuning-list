That's probably very hard to prove.
It's known that e and pi are transcendental, but not if e + pi is.
I think it's known neither if for instance sin 1 is.

My favourite equality of Ramanujan is so elegant I'll try to write it here:


                                        2
   a   2     ____                     -a
  (  -x     V pi `                   e
  | e   dx = ----  -  --------------------------------------------
  )           2       2a + 1 / 
 0                            a + 2 /
                                     2a + 3 /
                                             a + 4 /
                                                    2a + 5 / .....

Even if they are irrational as you write:

This is Hilbert's Seventh problem which was proven to be true 
partly in 1929 and 1930 and completely by Gelfond and Schneider 
in 1934 independently.
 b
a  is transcendental if a and b are algebraic, a /= 0,1 and
b is irrational.

Transcendental numbers are always irrational as shown by
Franz Kriftner.

That's not exactly true. But this is more the domain of
computational complexity.

There is, but you need an infinite amount of time.
The set of all algebraic numbers is namely enumerable.
All rational numbers are enumerable, so you can enumerate
the coefficients of the algebraic equations whose solutions
are the algebraic numbers, and therefore enumerate the algebraic 
equations themselves if you do it cleverly.

I believe the first million digits of pi pass the chi-square
test for randomness. I'm not sure what this means for the 
colour of the spectrum of the digit values; it may be white or not.

I'm not sure exactly which theorem Brian means. But entropy in 
information theory and entropy in physics are different concepts which
-regrettably perhaps- share the same name. I remember my information
theory professor saying he regretted it in any case since it's often
a cause of confusion.
