Subject: JUST SAYING HI!

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <CXL03253@niftyserve.or.jp>

Hi! I subscribed to this list recently so will do a simple self-intro.
  I was really excited when I found this list because, you know, it is a very 
hard job to find people that have interest in retunings. I personally just hav
e a electric fletless bass and a fletless classic guitar (tuned c,d,g,e,a,g>>>
closed harmony) and can just control a cheap FM sound module with an ollllllll
d MSX computer(to play retuned sounds). My friend HITOMI SHIMIZU is running a 
rock band named SYZYGYS and is using organ (it's a curio) retuned under HARRY'
s 43-tone method. It sound really friendly 
and that's the reason why I began to get rid of FLETS of my string instruments
. The other influence had been given to me by a post-minimalist(?) GLEN BRANCA
 when I made an interview for a MAG called KEYBOARD SPECIAL. He pointed out th
at the asian people used to play music based on upper harmonics. In JAPAN we h
ave a traditional intrument called SHO which is something like a compact bambo
o organ. It makes a very very closed harmony but becomes an AIR for me. Well I
 think this has something to do with what G
LEN said.
  Hmm...want to write more but I think I taking too much space for a private m
essage. Looking forward to learn a lot from this list.
  SEE-YOU!
