   Oh yes!  Up to a point anyway.  That's an essential element of, or
approach to perhaps, a nonoctave tuning, which I have long found
interesting.  I however have been working mostly with two nonoctave equal
temperaments.

   But either way, you're absolutely right that the complexity of the
harmony increases more rapidly when you omit two (or more).  And so also
does the variety.
