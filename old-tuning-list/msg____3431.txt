Subject: Re: Szanto Redux: Partch thoughts...

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Hi, all.  Just back from Camp Rising Sun and thought it's time to get 
back to internet communication.  Saw yet another response by Harry 
Partch witness Jon Szanto and felt there is still too much 
misunderstanding to drop the potato...just yet.

While Jon agrees with my point, he obfuscates it.  Though in Navaholand 
during the non-corporeal Lincoln Center Revelation, I heard the earlier 
*premiere* in Philadelphia: there the Partch instruments were practically 
hidden from view behind the acting, were each amplified to distortion 
(mentioned as a problem by the largely positive John Rockwell NYTimes 
review), and followed-up by a NY premiere with stick figure singers.  
Perhaps there were no other such *non-corporeal* performance of Partch 
because Danlee Mitchell stopped directing Partch productions soon after.

That's exactly how I feel by your posts, "Damned if I do and damned if I 
don't."  To my knowledge there is no performance of Partch in the U.S. 
other than Newband, solo guitarist Jon Schneider, former Partch ensembler 
Francis Thumm, and the AFMM.  The effort and financial support to present 
Partch in concert is formidable.  Audiences and critics have responded 
enthusiastically.  So why is the impression being made repeatedly that 
these concerts - still unheard by Mr. Szanto - are counterfiets?  

The point about the Indie is that idealism is all fine and good, but 
Partch realized practicality simultaneously.  That is exactly what I do: 
Partch works that require the least amount of specialized percussion, 
that have rarely if ever been performed, that have never been recorded or 
recorded poorly.  And yes, Gate 5 was successful, if not measured solely 
by money, IMHO.

The only instrument that the AFMM replaces is chromolodeon with a 
Proteous synthesizer attached to an 88-key manual.  Henry Lowengard is 
devoted to capturing its sound and regularly updates the patch(es).  To 
stop performances because of this, already agreed to by Mr. Mitchell as 
logical, is self-serving.

Are you saying that we are Garfield Cadets?  E-mail is easily 
misconstrued.  Re: voice, Danlee wrote me of the Li Po we had both 
intoned in performance in NYC that neither of us had Harry Partch's voice 
(while admiring my expression and sentiment). :)

Jon seems to take perverse delight in defending rubber bands, clearly 
keeping his ego in check.

You may want to keep touching on this, because it is more than merely 
hipocritical.  Remember also that even paranoids have enemies.  To me the 
transcription is no blight: it is beautifully played by Stefani Starin 
and Dean Drummond for flute and zoomoozophone.  It is only the behind 
the scenes double standards that I find objectionable.

Whether or not Jon looks at music as competition, or politics, or 
philosophy, or entertainmnet, etc. matters little in the big picture.  I 
create new music all the time and never take auditions.  (Actually went 
to John Dewey High School, an experimental non-competitive school in 
Brooklyn.)  The use of competition does bother me.

Am I to be ambushed at the path?  Please, Jon, tell us what you have been 
grappling with?

Hmmm.
