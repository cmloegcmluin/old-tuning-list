   Thanks again for the info.

   Best I can tell from your website, and from what I've heard, the K2x00
does not make possible my 88CET keyboard mapping, wherein the gap between
adjacent keys is 88 cents except for that between G#/Ab and A, wherein its
zero.  Since it's not completely equally tempered (because of the skipped
G#/Ab key), and since it doesn't repeat in octaves, it sounds like it
doesn't fit either provision.)

   Is that correct?
