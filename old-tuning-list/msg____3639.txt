Paul H., surely the average error is less than 1/4 step, since that is the 
maximum error. The mean error is actually zero, since errors can be positive 
or negative, but the standard deviation (square root of mean of squared 
errors) is a better measure of the overall size of the errors. Graphing the 
standard deviation with respect to all the JI intervals up to a given limit 
for all ETs starting with 1-tET gives a bumpy graph (with dips at famous 
ETs) which for the most part closely follows an overall curve. This curve is 
given by 1/sqrt(12) times the step size of the ET. In other words, without 
assuming any consistency at all, the standard error of random intervals is 
.2887 step. Of course, the mean absolute error of random intervals, without 
assuming any consistency at all, is .25 step, since all values from 0 to .5 
step are taken on with equal probability.

I have not yet figured out how to calculate the expected errors given 
consistency, but a good measure of how "special" an ET is is given by 
assuming "in-tune-ness" is given by a normal curve centered around the just 
interval with some appropriately psychoacoustically researched standard 
deviation (in this context, standard deviation refers to the "width" of the 
curve). Then the difference between the "in-tune-ness" of the standard 
deviation of the ET and the "in-tune-ness" of the nominal value of 
1/sqrt(12) times the step size gives you the "specialness" of the ET. My 
first post to this digest was a table of the most "special" tunings, for 
various harmonic limits and various reasonable values of the standard 
deviation, and I later reposted it with all the inconsistent tunings 
deleted. Needless to say, most everyone's favorite ET was to be found 
somewhere on the table -- they're all the most special!
