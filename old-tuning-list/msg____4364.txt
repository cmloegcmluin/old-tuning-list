When I was working on this and other related pieces,
I was using the Samson box here at CCRMA connected to
a relatively low-fidelity quad speaker setup in a
room next to the old Lab's machine room (this was
the (end of the) era of enormous air-conditioned machines).
The thing sounded great in that environment.  Then
we played it in a concert in very reverberant room
in S.F. and it sounded like mush.  Then later it
got put on CD, and I listened at home in my kitchen,
and decided it needed to be compressed, so the
latest version has a much smaller dynamic range,
less reverb, less noise, but maybe lost some of the 

exuberance.  Rats.
