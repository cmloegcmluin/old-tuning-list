Subject: tuners in Los Angeles area

From: Greg Schiemer <gregs@mail.usyd.edu.au>

G'day,

Just a message to say I'll be presenting a paper at the IEEE LANMAN98
workshop in Banff 17th-20th May and I've been offered a flight returning

to Sydney via Los Angeles. I thought it would be worth trying to connect

with some of the folks on the tuning group on the way through LA. Maybe
I could present about four or five recent (and very interesting)
electro-
acoustic pieces in Just Intonation by Sydney-based composers who study
with me at the Conservatorium. I'd also be happy to repeat my IEEE
presentation. My paper is entitled “A MIDI protocol via IEEE
1394-1995”. For those who don’t know IEEE 1394-1995 is the
high-speed LAN standard more commonly known as firewire.
Or just a social visit where I could learn more about what's
happening there. And there's plenty to learn as I've never been
on the eastern side of the Pacific (it must be fun driving on the
wrong side of the road!) Anyone interested contact me ASAP.
