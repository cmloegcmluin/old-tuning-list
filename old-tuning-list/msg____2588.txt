I once read in an acoustics book that even ordinary people can
perceive frequencies up to 200,000 cycles in the sense that they
can tell that sounds are different, even if they only differ by
harmonics in that very high frequency range.  Unfortunately, that
was about 35 years ago, and I can no longer remember the name of
the book or it's author, for certain.  I thought the author was
an englishman named white, but people on another music forum were
very skeptical, and couldn't locate such a book.  Does anyone
here know the real answer?
