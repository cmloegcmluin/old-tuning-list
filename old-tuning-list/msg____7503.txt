But crossfading between 2 layers will halve the already limited polyphony
of the Ensoniq samplers, because even if the layer is silent it will still
rob one note of polyphony.  So it is theoretically possible, but not very
practical.  Velocity switching would not have this problem, but control is
an issue.  There just is not an easy solution.  Believe me, I spent years
trying to workaround the limitations of the Ensoniq sampler architecture
before I finally moved on.

Achieving nTET and nCET scales of any degree on K2000/K2500s is explained
in detail at my web site:
http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/
All that's required is to edit 3-6 parameters per program layer. Editing at
the sample roots or keymap level is not necessary.

No filters at all, just FM.  Yamaha did not implement resonant filters with
FM until the SY77 and SY99, which are limited to 2 keyboard scales.
