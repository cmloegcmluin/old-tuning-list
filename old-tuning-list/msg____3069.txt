It's pretty incredible to think of a CDR recorder costing what they do today;
I remember ... probably only about five years ago ... when Digidesign was
marketing a Yamaha studio unit (to say the least) for $40,000.  

   I think it's worth warning folks though that rumor in the Studio community
has it that WORM CD technology (like CDRs) has a limited lifetime before errors
start cropping up.  They're based on photosensitive dies rather than pits
literally pressed into a plate of foil.  And when you're bombarding them with a
laser to read them, as well as possibly exposing them to continuous room- or
sun-light, it's not impossible that such dies could fade.  

   But I don't claim to know much about CDRs;  I'm just repeating what I've
heard in the rumor mill.
