   The guitar fits in the category I described here as
"much-more-definite-pitched".  The piano is a definite-pitched instrument.


   I have played classical guitar as well as bassoon, saxophone, and viola
in the past, so I certainly do understand what you're saying.  Classical
guitarists especially are easily annoyed by the general public's
misconception that guitarists can't vary the pitch, especially downward.

   Still, on a guitar the struggle is much more to make the pitch DEVIATE
from the ideal to which it's tuned, whereas on a woodwind, brass, or
orchestral string instrument, the struggle is to make the pitch MATCH the
ideal.  (Yes, I do realize that I'm oversimplifying there, but only
slightly.)
