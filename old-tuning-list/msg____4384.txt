Those aren't mutually exclusive. I'd like to be able to compose with a tool which allowed access to any pitch 
I needed without having to predetermine the set. That doesn't mean my pitch choices must be random or 
lacking analyzable structure.

All analogies break down, and it probably doesn't help much to pick at them, but it's kind of fun, so: To me, 
you have it backwards. A "coherent system of pitches" sounds like the "too complicated" six quarks etc., and 
the idea of picking any pitch you need from a single parameter of frequency sounds like the unifying, 
simplifying analog to a physical theory which would explain all 6 quarks. 

I'd like to think of it more as systemized tunings being individual specimens of the infinity of pitch 
combinations, all based on the single umbrella parameter of frequency, just as the infinity of molecular 
configurations may someday be explainable by a single physical theory.

I prefer to think of pitch systems as temporary compositional devices which may be used over a whole piece or 
just in passing. A composition approaching the complexity of natural beauty might end up using thousands 
of pitches in hundreds of analyzable "molecular" subsets.
