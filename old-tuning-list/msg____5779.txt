Subject: Historical temperaments

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

If we restrict ourselves to Mozart, he probably used a lot of meantone
during his career - the church organs in Salzburg were apparently in still
meantone (whether 1/5 or 1/4 comma, I cannot be sure), and he did not
compose for fretted instruments - the only instruments of the era most
definitely in equal temperament (whereas Haydn left behin a huge repertoire
of music for Baryton). In all probability, composers of the era were
confronted with wildly varied tunings, and restriction to the ''good''
meantone keys was a safe decision.

Instruments of fixed pitch continued to be made in meantone well into thenineteenth century. English harmoniums were usually in meantone, the
concertina described in Berlioz's _Instrumentation_ (1844) is in meantone.
Ellis indicates a gradual introduction of 12tet over the nineteenth
century, replacing a meantone, where the g# was adjusted somewhat. Ellis
also makes it clear that the piano was in 12tet first (Ellis disputes
Broadwood'c claim for 1811 and argues for a date around 1844), followed by
the organ (first in 1854, but in large numbers not until the 1880s), and
then the harmonium.  Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
