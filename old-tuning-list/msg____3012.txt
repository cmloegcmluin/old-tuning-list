   I like that one, because I've always been of the persuasion that theories are
very well worth exploring in that they can provide new playgrounds for musicians
to play in.  But ultimately, when it comes to making music in that playground,
you just gotta feel it.  


   I can also relate to Doren's point about Partch taking time to get familiar
with.  At first it sounded strange, but now it really doesn't sound all that
strange at all.  In fact much of it is downright palatable.  When I first heard
Partch, by the way, I was already familiar with other unusual tunings.  The
strangest thing about it for me was what at first sounded like extreme overuse
of percussion timbres.  But like I say, it doesn't sound extreme anymore.
