   NAME:
          Penpal greetings

  This is not a virus, but a widespread hoax, warning about a dangerous e-mail

  This hoax is very similar to Good Times. See the description of Good Times for
  more information.

There's an excellent essay on Internet hoaxes at

<http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/voyager/edge/97/01/26/index.html>

I would recommend everyone read it before passing on any message that
includes the phrase, "please forward this to everyone you know . . . "
