San Diego, huh? I must be the only person on the East Coast! There is a
Boston Microtonal Society; Patrick Ozzard-Low visited a few weeks ago
and we went to a meeting. Present were Ezra Sims, Joe Maneri, Steven
Lantner, Julie Werntz, and a few others. All are active in making
72-tone music in the area. Oh well.
