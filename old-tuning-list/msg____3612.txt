Subject: PBS documentary

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Did anyone see the great PBS documentary about Harrison, Riley and Partch 
last night?  I was surprised to find it just flipping around,and such a 
well-done piece of television!  It included interviews, performances and 
recollections at the beautiful houses of Lou and Terry, plus new footage 
of Partch performances (Intrusions and US Highball) from recent Newband 
concerts.  I also got to see what Danlee Mitchell looks like without 
lambchop sideburns:)  Incase you missed it, don't worry--I'm sure that it 
will be played over and over when the pledge drives start <joke>, and it 
will make an excellent and inspiring tool for your intro to new music 
courses.

A side thought is that I wish that more people on this list would 
announce such programs before they air, as well as all relevant concerts 
and lectures. It would be a shame to miss something good.

This has been your television correspondant, Adam Silverman.

Goodnight.
