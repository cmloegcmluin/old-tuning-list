Subject: "Tuning, Timbre, Sprectrum, Scale"

From: "Benjamin Tubb" <brtubb@cybertron.com>

I've just finished reading and listening to the CD included with the book
"Tuning, Timbre, Sprectrum, Scale" by William A. Sethares (1998), Springer,
ISBN 3-540-76173-X, which for $69.95 was not a trivial expense but as it turned
out, a very worthwhile investment in a thoroughly readable and thought out
discussion of music theory tuning consonance and dissonance issues with 33 CD
tracks of examples!

I'm posting this email to commend and highly recommend this book/CD combination
in further "enlightenning" anyone on such subjects.

In regards to MIDI controller supports for full 128 MIDI Note Tuning Spec.
accessability, can anyone recommend specific MIDI devices (whether keyboard or
not) that support such features whether in a sampler or synth workstation?
