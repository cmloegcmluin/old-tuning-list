   I'm not completely certain what in particular you mean by "acoustically"
in this particular case, but I suppose it's worth pointing out that, to our
logarithmic tuning perception, a geometric mean sounds like an arithmetic
mean.

   So, if by "acoustically" you mean "by ear", you can tune that
intermediate pitch so that the melodic interval size from the 1:1 to the
pitch in question sounds the same as the interval from the pitch in
question to the 5:4.
