Subject: Denver loves 19

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick aboard...today I got wonderful news...I won a $1000.00
award from a local arts organization for my 19 tone piece "Jimmy and
Joe"...this says several things to me; first, I totally feel that I'm
on the right track with alternate tunings; 2nd, that people are pretty
openminded here in Denver towards new music; and 3rd, persistance pays
off. This is the 3rd year I entered this contest; of course, the piece
I sent is a fast country breakdown, and rather accessible, even though
it's in another tuning. Then again, who knows what judges think any-
way? I am very grateful I won, and this gives me more optimism for
the future.

On another note, let me say I am astonished by the discussion concerning
whether or not Partch's music should only be performed on his own instru-
ments...what a total non-issue. Who cares about such details? The music
is the issue, not the vehicle...in fact, I think it is very interesting
to hear music for one instrument performed on another...perhaps a new
reading of a piece can bring out things in the music that were not there
before, or lend a totally new perspective to the end result. In fact,
JS Bach did not specify an instrument for his Art of Fugue; so, what
instrument should it be played on? Also, I say the more the merrier...
once a piece is created, and is in the physical world, I feel it is
fair game for any and all interpretations. I myself often have several
versions of my pieces, and it's a hoot to see how they change from one
situation to another. One of my guitar studies wound up as a clarinet
solo, and I dug it...again, who cares?

Also, was I correct in reading a recent post which said only members
of Newband could play Partch's instruments? If this is true, what a
total crock of shit. Can someone explain to me what's going on here,
if indeed this is true? Arrgh...Hstick
