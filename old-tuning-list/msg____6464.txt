Subject: Re: Woodwind etc

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

therefore new instruments aren't necessary...

Actually, I'm in favor of all manner of new inventions.  Please, feel
encouraged.  It is only in the details that I respond.

When Patrick stated that "woodwind performers instinctively adjust pitch
as a matter of course, in all music," I must interject.  Bassoonists are
taught to memorize a distinct physical shape for each and every note that
both centers the tone of the instrument while closely match the norm 12ET
that is represents.

Each and every microtone produced on bassoon requires the same attention,
often taking a bit of time to control (e.g. 6 months to a year).  I don't
believe it is instinct, so much as physical memory which allows for
playing in tune.

Frankly, playing microtonally on bassoon is eminently manageable.  I
believe this is so for all instruments, other than fixed pitch instruments
(which can easily be redisigned accordingly, and have).  I think of it as
a monochord.
