Or, if you don't like that example, how 'bout a JI-ist who wanted to
tune up Ellis' duodene, which is a 5-limit scale with a diameter of 5.
If, as Daniel Wolf mentioned a while back, someone made a synth whose
internal ET was 612, it would require no nanotempering for this purpose,
because 612TET is level 21 consistent at the 5-limit.  665 would also
work (level 6), but 624 (level 3) would not.
