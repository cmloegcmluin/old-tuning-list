Subject: sorry...NDD 36 again ..

From: Andrzej Gawel <gawel@sejm.gov.pl>

Dear Friends,
Thank You for Your answers. J don't know what was happened with my
previous mail. Our supervisor 
works days and nights to make us suprise. May be, he changes
something in attachments today.
Ok. J send to You text from Tom (Tomasz Liese) in pure ASCII.
You can send Your comments to my e-mail.
Regards,
Andrew. (gawel@sejm.gov.pl)

The NPD 36 system, wich I presented at the Warsaw Academy of Music and
Polish Radio Program 3 in Warsaw, is continuation of the diatonic
major-minor 
system and extension of the principles of functional harmony. The system
is 
based on the rules of physic and does not depend on common octave
division.
It can be achieved by the application of approximations
wich result from dividing an octave into 29, 36,41,54,72 and more.For
notation, melodies and harmony the system includes the logarytmic octave
divisjon into 36 section and for the construction of music noises the
division into 1152 and 768.Many new terms are of similai nature to
traditional ones , which considerably facilitates the understanding of
the NPD 36 system.

1. Measures
octave        1200 cents         1152 stripes
band          3.125 cents        3 stripes
semiton       32 bands           96 stripes
microton      33.33 cents        32 stripes
sharp         + 1 microton
flat          - 1 microton

2 The Microdiatonic System
Number of sharps of major keys in order 0 to 17 :
C, T.Q, G, Z, N, D, U, K, A, R, O, E, V, L, B, S, Win.
Order of sharps :Fin, Win, Min, Cin, Tin, ... etc.
Number of  flat of major keys in order  1 to 18 :
M, W, F, P, Len, Ven, En, Oen, Ren, Aen, Ken, Uen, Den, Nen, Zen, Gen,
Qen, Ten.
Order of  flat : Ben, Len, Ven, En, ... etc.
For exemple : For Qmajor-0 key are sharps : Fin, Win. For F major-0 key
are flat : Ben, len, Ven.
Replacement mark : Y , Xn , P¾n , Sn , Jn.

3.Modes
Number of  flat :
0  -  A minor-0 key   or  C major-0
1  -  M major-0 key   or  C major-1
2  -  W major-0 key   or  C major-2
3  -  F major-0  key    or  C major-3
4  -  P major-0 key     or  C major-4
5  - Len major-0 key  or  C minor-4
6  - X major-0  key    or  C minor-3
7  - Y major-0  key    or  C minor-2
8  - Oen major key  or  C minor-1
9  - Ren major Key  or  C minor-0

4. The C major-0 key :
C, Q, Z, D, K, R, E, L, F, M, T, G, N, U, A, O, V, B, W, c.
The tierce round :C, E, G, B, D, M, A, Q, E, N, B, K, M, O, Q, L, N, W,
K, T, O, Z, L, U, W,
R, T, V, Z, F, U, C, R, G, V, D, F, A, C.

5. The Spectral Harmony
For spectral harmony and for the construction of  music noises the
system includes 26 natural intervals the
mark : h1 to h26.
Size of interval expresed proportion frequency - H(n) B/A
Size of interval expresed of stripes : h(n) 1162 log ( B/A )
when  A  n( n+2 ) , B A+1
For exemple : H3 x H4 x ... x H8 6/5  or  h3 + h4 + ... + h8 303  [
stripes ].

6. Subsystems
The systems contains an open list of  sub-systems concerning methods of
using it.
