I disagree strongly with these statements. First, I don't believe that "the
bulk of the greatest music ever composed" lies within the last 300 years or
so of Western European culture. When the world's music is viewed as a
whole, certainly ideas such as tonal harmony, 12TET, and counterpoint are
the "exotic" concepts. Even within this tradition, harmony is only one
aspect of theory, and yet it absolutely dominates our curricula. (Certainly
one reason for this dominance is that it has nice, objective rules that can
be taught in a textbook and graded.)

I try to teach my students that THERE IS NO "corpus of real masterpieces."
I teach certain pieces because I happen to like them and because they
provide good illustrations of the concepts I need to get across. I
encourage all students to make their own decisions about the "masterpieces"
that they like. My job is to get the students to understand pieces, and
perhaps come away turned onto a piece or type of music that they were
previously unaware of, or to see an old favorite in a new light.

Finally, I don't teach tuning systems so that students will understand
Harry Partch, for example, or other composers who use "exotic" intonation
systems. I teach them because they are a fundamental part of all
pitch-based music. I much prefer to teach the "whys" that lie behind even
common-practice theory (as far as is known) than to have students memorize
chord spellings and rules.

For example: Why is singing in parallel octaves not considered polyphony?
Why is an augmented chord dissonant, if all its component intervals are
consonant? What is the meaning of the title The Well-Tempered Clavier? Why
does a string quartet suddenly have to adjust in a common-tone modulation
to some foreign keys? Each of these questions, perhaps trivial in
themselves and easily ignored by a theory instructor, betrays a lack of
understanding of the harmonic series and tuning systems.
