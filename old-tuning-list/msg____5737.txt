I have to agree with your disagreement.  :)

I have not seen anyone else voice this opinion, but I believe that the
development of sonata form in the classic period was directly related to
the inequality (but acceptability) of the different keys.  Perhaps the
greatest difference between the classic period sonata form and its baroque
binary form predecessors was the use of a development section.  Although
many beginning students think of the development as developing themes,
this, in fact, does not occur (in the sense of altering, expanding,
treating fugally, etc.) much in the classic period.  Instead, many
different keys are visited.  

I believe that the purpose of visiting the many different keys was partly
to 'feel out' the relative tension of the different keys.  To put it
simplistically, just as beginning musicians will play "Mary Had A Little
Lamb" in minor 'just to see how it sounds,' I believe that the development
section visited many different keys to see how they sounded, since they
did NOT sound the same.

Of course, this effect is totally lost on an equally tempered instrument.
