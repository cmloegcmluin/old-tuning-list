Subject: teaching tunings

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...Paul E's layout of his proposed tuning course was
monstrous...hard to beat that one. Of course, I teach a lot, and my
way of dealing with teaching tunings is pretty modest...since many
of my students study blues, alternate tunings is not even our main
focus...I have to introduce the subject on the side, sort of...and
I must say the response is very positive. At my stage of the tuning
game, I think of myself as sort of an advanced beginner anyway, and
I am fortunate to get to hang with the heavy dudes in the tuning arena;
my studies continue always.

So, I am happy just to introduce people to the basic ideas of the whole
shebang, and if something develops from there, we'll deal with it. One
of the interesting things about my school gig is the wide range of folks
I teach, from 12 year old rock enthusiasts, to 49 year old blue collar
guys that want to learn some Albert King licks...by letting "ordinary"
folks know about this wonderous world of sounds and tunings, it becomes
a more natural thing, and if it feels natural, it's easier to accept.

By playing blues and other traditional styles in other tunings, on gigs
we do around town, brings things right down to street level, and puts it
where it belongs, of course. If a kid of 12 (or 7, as my daughter is)
can dig it, the sky's the limit. And I'm sure, as my comfort level rises
with tunings, my methods may change as well. An idea like Paul's is not 
too far fetched...we just need enough people to come to the class. By
showing folks the utter reality that 12/eq is only one of MANY tuning,
we get them to thinking in a new way about music...then, someday soon
there will be music in the air in other than the dreaded 12/oct. Hstick
