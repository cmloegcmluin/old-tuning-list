 Where is the 12 ?

 I prefer to use the word "Dodecatonic" instead of "Dodecaphonic" to speak
about a 12 scale.
 We have a monotonic scale, a pentatonic scale, a diatonic scale. Why a
dodecaphonic one ? Shoemberg is Shoemberg, dodecaphonism is dodecaphonism
and dodecatonic is dodecatonic.

 The 12 in "root 12 of 2" means "Number of Intervals".
12 intervals subsequents and equals that are closed in between 13
"intervals to the tonic".
 Number 2 is also an interval.

  On other side people frequently confuse the expression 12Tet with
dodecatonism. I'll make reference to this subject when in the future I speak
on Piano's Tuning.
