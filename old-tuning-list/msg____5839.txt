Subject: Perishing Logic

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Fret positions on surviving early instruments are weak evidence of tuningpractice for several reasons. First of all, the frets were tied on so that
their position is likely to have shifted. Second, the frets were made of
natural materials (especially gut) so that they tend to decay over time.
Third, as all players of fretted instruments know, the position of the fret
is only one factor in the pitch produced. Most players can adjust the pitch
considerably with their fretting fingers.

Lindley's book on Lutes, Viols, and Temperaments (has someone got the
reference handy?) gives some ideas about how a set of frets can be subtlyset so as not to yield the same ratio on each string. Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
