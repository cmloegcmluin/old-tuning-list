Speaking only for ccrma, this is because no one here
has used CSound to any great extent -- before 1990
we used the Samson box or Mus10; since then, the
MusicKit, Cmix, or CLM.  I translated all the reverberators
I could find and made them part of the CLM distribution
files.  Also included is a working example of the
FOF algorithm, arbitrary-order filters, floating point
output, and so on.

I believe Paul Lansky's LPC code is available in
Cmix.  The best spectral analysis/resynthesis package
that I know of is Xavier Serra's SMS.

On the general problem of academic code that doesn't work --
we don't have the resources of either time or 

money to port software to every machine, so we make it 

work on what is available to us. At least the stuff is
free, and in the public domain -- Brian would really gnash his
teeth if he ever tried to get his hands on some trade
secret (which in the computer music industry means
table lookup, or something equally disappointing).

I'd invite Brian to take a look at CLM, but it doesn't
yet run on the PC (except under NeXTStep or Linux), and
is too slow to be usable on the Mac (these are on my
ever-growing list of things to do).
