Thanks for reposting this reference. I'm sorry not to have taken notice of
it the first time around.

Fink, in his paper on the flute, takes note of some of complicating factors
that Gary and Dan have brought up, but essentially says that, since they
would be random, their effect on pitch would be cancelled out. This is
assuming that the Neanderthals, unlike later instrument builders, took no
notice of their hole diameter, bore, and so on, and that Fink's guess for
the overall length of the flute is close. Both are pretty tenuous
assumptions, I think.

I've played renaissance gemshorns which are also flutes made out of bones
(horns) and the diameters of the holes vary considerably from instrument to
instrument. I had assumed that the instrument maker gradually widened them
as a way to fine tune them, but I don't know. (One hole on the bass
gemshorn was too big for most people's fingers, I recall.)

The hole diameters on the Balinese suling I mentioned do not really vary as
far as I can measure. The bore seems cylindrical. However, if the pitch is
a function of the overall length of the closed tube, why, if is there such
a long distance between the last hole and the end of the tube? That is,
when all my fingers are down, I assume the air column is the length of the
whole tube, about 43.7 cm as I measure it. When I lift my finger off the
lowest hole, the vibrating length decreases to about 34 cm (measured to the
middle of the hole), but the pitch only goes up about a whole tone. When I
lift up my next finger, the length drops only to 30.8 cm, but the pitch
rises another whole tone.

I finally saw the Discovery article yesterday, and I must say that it looks
like a much more profound discovery than the one in Slovenia. As Clif
mentioned, there is a tusk "tuba" with sixteen holes (apparently equally
spaced, as Fink may be disappointed to learn), something that could have
been a bagpipe, graduated bones that could have been parts of a xylophone,
and a small bone triangle.

What was more astonishing to me is that they found a 50,000-year-old cave
painting of musicians in a procession playing these instruments! In the
photograph reproduced, the tuba is clearly played by blowing, though it's
impossible to tell if it was a flute or buzzed-lip instrument. The triangle
can clearly be seen played by another musician. Another figure is more
amorphous, but one can easily imagine it to be a bagpipe. This is the first
cave painting ever found associated with the Neanderthals, by the way.

It would be great to find out more about this discovery.
