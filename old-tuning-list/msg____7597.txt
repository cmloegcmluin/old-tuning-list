STRAYLIGHT  Ambient, Avant Synthesis.  This electro acoustic
improvisational trio features JASON FINKELMAN on percussion, GEOFF GERSH on
electric guitar and CHARLES COHEN on analog Buchla Easel.   An unknown
adventure awaits as Straylight embarks on a musical journey - sounds evoke
images of rain forests, lands in urban jungles and Moroccan caravans
crossing Tottori sands.

Special guest DAVID GAMPER is a Sound Shifter - his electronic wizardry
transforms sound in remarkable ways.  He is a member of The Deep Listening
Band which has toured the world experimenting with sound - from  Tokyo
Panasonic National Hall with over 700 loudspeakers - to a two million
gallon cistern near Seattle.


There are also two installations:  The Wish Machine by Chrysanne Stathacos &
Reconstructions: The Video Image Outside of Time by Van McElwee.


VANGUARD VISIONS is a not for profit corporation created to provide wider
