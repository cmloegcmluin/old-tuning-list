Subject: VIRUS

From: Gary Morrison <MorriSonics@compuserve.com>

Consider that, for a virus to infect a system or at least for it to "do
something to a system", your computer has to execute it as a program. 
Programs, in that general sense of the word, are the only way a computer
can do anything including damage.  

   Although this is getting a LITTLE blurrier over time, there is currently
no way that merely reading a message can cause the content of the message
to be executed as a program.  Messages are strictly data.  

   Java and helper apps in Web Surfing make that distinction a little less
clear than it has been in the past, but still, as yet, messages sent over
the net don't run as programs.
