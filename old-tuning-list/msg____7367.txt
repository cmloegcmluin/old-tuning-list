From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Hendrix tuned his axe a half step low to usual; his low E string was 
an Eb instead of E, so the strings would indeed be looser...Hstick PS if 
you really want to analyze one of his tunes for micronotes, look at 
"Machine Gun" from the Band of Gypsies album...
