This is a quick response to John's comments about emotional response to
music.  Interestingly, I too was moved by a CD recording a friend loaned
me several weeks ago entitled Bulgarian Folk Ensembles and Songs--plain
case, no cover notes, the only thing on the disc is Balkanton (the
producer, I presume) and names of the ensembles, "Pirin" Ensemble,
Blagoevgrad (1-6), "Philip Koutev" Ensemble, Sofia (7-10), Northern
Ensemble, Pleven (11,12), "Trakia" Ensemble, Plovdiv (13-16 ), Bulgarian
Television and Radio Folk Song Ensemble (17-20)--No names of individual
tracks and no other info at all.  This disc contains simply the most
exquisite female a capella (sp?) music of a quality and energy I have ever
heard.  I believe this music demonstrates the potential transcendence of
musical form and communicates something way beyond words.  It appears that
these women communicate directly to our physiology, experiences which they
express, share, and embed within the tuning of their music , within the
frequency of the sound itself.  If anyone has any further info on the
availability of this CD or others by this apparently rich tradition,
please post to the list or to me privately.  Thank you.
