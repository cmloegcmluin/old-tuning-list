I deleted my VT100 emulator a few days ago, so I can't even get
text based web access at the minute.  It's fairly easy to write a
web page, so everybody should detail their own obsessions.
Eventually, we'll have a comprehensive reference source.

Is there anything on the web covering the basics of tuning?  I'm
trying to do this myself.  I just scrapped an explanation of
overtones because there was too much physics in it.
