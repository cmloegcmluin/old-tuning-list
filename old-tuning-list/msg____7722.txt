Subject: Vai again

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Just checked the Vai interview in Guitar World...his guitars are 
indeed equal tempered, 16 tone and 24 tone. He's evidently had them since 
about 1985. Looking forward to the day when he records a CD with them, 
because he really is a monster player...Hstick
