While E! lets you set frequencies with a precision of 4096 steps/oct, in
fact there are only 1024 realizable steps.  The values you enter are rounded
off.  You can verify this by setting two keys to the same frequency and
listening to the beats as you adjust the setting of one of them.  One would
want to take this quantization into account when trying to find the best
parameter value to approximate a particular interval.  In other words,
calculating based on 4096 steps and then letting E! round off will not
always give the best 1024-step equivalent.
