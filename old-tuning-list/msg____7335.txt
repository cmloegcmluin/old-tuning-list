Subject: 88CET Ear Training CDs, Part 9

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

What's on my 88CET CDs?
-----------------------

   They have 66 groups of exercises.  Here they are categorized by general
topic matter:

Transposition, Pseudokeys and Pseudokey Signatures:
- "Repeat after me the upward circle of fifths"
- "I'll list a note, and you tell me the notes one and two fifths
  above it."
- "Repeat after me the pseudokey signatures of the various sharp-
  based pseudokeys"
- "I'll list a pseudokey and you tell me the pseudokey signature."
- The analogous above four exercises for the downward circle of
  fifths and flat-based pseudokey signatures.
- "Tell me the pseudokey signatures and then, one-by-one, the notes
  of the ascending pseudodiatonic scales."
- Preview of singing 7:4 ratios (because 88CET pseudodiatonic scales
  repeat in 7:4s).  Listening exercise, then singing (with correct
  note name).
- "Sing along with the following pseudodiatonic scales."

Interval-Hearing:
- "Minor wholetones."  Listening, then singing.
- Subminor thirds:  Pairs of naturals that are a subminor third
  apart (once you memorize the naturals, it's easy to extrapolate
  the sharps and flats).
- Subminor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then
  descending, with correct note name.
- Supramajor thirds:  Usage in pseudodiatonic scale.  Key indepen-
  dent (by scale-step number), then by naturals.  First repeating
  them as stated on tape, then quizzing.
- Supramajor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then
  descending, with correct note name.
- Neutral thirds:  Same as done with supramajor thirds.
- Operating within a pseudokey framework:  "[an A sounds] This is
  scale step 1. [tone changes to C]  This interval is [pause for
  answer] subminor, so this is step [pause for answer] 3."  This
  is repeated for other thirds within pseudokey framework,
  occasionally injecting a note that does not fit within the
  pseudokey.
- A brief stint with perfect fifths - a sing-along.

A Quick Break from Interval-Hearing:
- 7 general rules stated for memorization, and then a quiz about them.

Interval-Hearing Continued:
- Tritones:  Same exercises as done above with supramajor thirds.
- Three exercises in distinguishing supramajor thirds, tritones and
  minor sixths.  (This is one of my weird, nonsensical hang-ups:
  somehow I sometimes get these three intervals confused.)
  - Listen to supramajor thirds.
  - Listen to some minor sixths.
  - Play various supramajor thirds, tritones, and minor sixths, and
    I am to identify them.  Occasionally inject a major sixth or
    off-fourth interval.
