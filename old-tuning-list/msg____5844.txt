Subject: Tuning of meantone guitars.

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

Gary asked how I tune my negative meantone guitars.
I use A4D0, as my reference pitch and tune all other notes relative to 
this.

If using standard guitar tunings I tune the open strings to EADGBE
from the IV or III frets starting from A20Hz on the fifth string.
This gives me an approximation.
I then go through a whole ritual to make sure that everything is
"harmonious".
This ritual usually includes.
(The sequence and time devoted to each step is determined by the
results of each test and adjustment, until I am satisfied that all
sounds "in tune".
  
a) Checking all the A's on each string by fretting playing and comparing.
b) Playing various triads and tetra chords in various keys.
c) Comparing the "Ghost-tones" at the VIII, V, IV II, III and XI 
to open and fretted notes, and listening for the beating 
(if present) or zero for octaves.
d) Checking against A's from electronic tuner, tuning fork, sampler,
   synth, recording, or other instruments.

I use 19, 25, and 31 frets per octave, and also 60 odd alternative
open tunings (This is Hawaii!)

All the details (including fretting specs and alternative tunings)
can be found at (and downloaded from):
