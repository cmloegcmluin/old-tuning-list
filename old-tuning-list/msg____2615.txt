The Proteus does have a "user" tuning which may (or may not) be fine 
enough for your purposes (which eliminates the use of the pbend 
altogether).

You would probably want to use a patch editor (I use Galaxy) rather than 
the front panel display (if it's even available there -- I'm not sure) 
which would be unbelievably tedious.

Basically, you can tune each interval individually, by simply typing in 
the value in cents. If you're working with 1200-cent octaves with 12 
division, you can do one octave and the Proteus will duplicate it; 
otherwise, you're stuck with doing all of them. Of course, in Vision 
it's up to you to keep track of what, say, "D#3" _really_ is (I use MAX, 
so they're all just numbers to me).

The disadvantage is that (for what I assume are floating-point limits or 
some such -- any ideas out there?) once you type in, say, 98, it 
recalculates to, maybe, 97.8682. (as I said, it may not be critical 
enough for your purposes.) The recalculation seems to stay within LND, 
though, and my poor shell-shocked ears think my stuff sounds ok (tho' 
there's a reason I'm doing this stuff with computers instead of string 
instruments).

I have a question about the Proteus itself (and the use of samples of 
conventional instruments in general) in tunings other than those they 
were designed for; aren't the resonating parts of the instruments 
designed to "sweeten" partials (by, for example, shaving miniscule 
amounts of wood from the inside of the body) which may not be present if 
the fundamental has been retuned (or more to the point here, are we 
hearing partials we wouldn't be if we were playing a _real_ instrument 
in that tuning)? (Sorry if the question seems naive (or incomprehensibly 
phrased) -- I just have to wonder how accurate my experience of these 
tunings is...)
