I found Bill Alves' comments on innovation in University Music education a
welcome dose of realism.  It's good to hear an insider's take on where some of
the difficulties lie.  Even though my formal Music education (beyond untold
hours of private lessons and reading on more advanced topics) stops at the
traditional Freshman and Sophomore Theory and Ear-Training classes, I've seen a
lot of what Bill's mentioned from a student's perspective.  Many of us have I'm
sure.  

   One factor in all of this that I find encouraging, perhaps surprisingly or
even ironically, is community colleges.  They have some advantages over
full-blown Universities with regard to innovative curricula:  
1.  In most US states anyway, they are paid by enrollment, so they are always
    scrounging for ways to keep students' interest rather than to weed them 
    out.
2.  They have somewhat less pressure to provide specific knowledge to feed into
    Junior- and Senior-level courses.  
3.  A fair percentage of their student body consists somewhat older adults who
    are taking music (or whatever) courses simply because they want to, rather 
    than to begrudgingly fill some required slot in the curriculum.  
4.  Most community colleges have fewer distractions (football for one, but 
    let's not get into that!).  
5.  Since they lack the tenure system, they're a little more open to hiring 
    innovative instructors.  

   Of course, they have disadvantages as well, especially the overall quality of
student (and instructor to a fair degree) they attract.  Some are quite good
though, my bassoon teacher back in high school was one.  

   Well, it's something to bear in mind anyway.
