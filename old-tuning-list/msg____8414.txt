Subject: C21 Orch Instrs - Contents

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

Further to my message yesterday about the instruments paper - I 
thought it might be useful just to list some of the contents 
headings and Appendices (to give a general idea.....)

On the subject of Appendices - I should have mentioned that I'm 
especially grateful to Paul Hahn for 'co-authoring' Appendix IV, 
which is an exposition of the idea of consistency in Equal 
Temperaments;  to Paul Erlich whose idea it originally is; and to  
to John (Chalmers) and Manuel (Op de Coul) who helped out during my 
hour of need!  Thanks to all! 

Am trying to make it available ASAP.

1.  Overview

- Why 21st Century Orchestral Instruments?
- Intonational Characteristics of Pitched Acoustic Instruments
- Twelve Division Equal-Temperament - in Theory and Practice
- Practicalities of Intonation on New Acoustic Instruments
- The Keyboard and the Success of Twelve Division Equal-Temperament 
- Towards a Provisional Alternative Tuning System Standard (or 
Standards)
- A Centre for 21st Century Acoustic Instruments 

2.  Towards the 'Acoustic Orchestra of the 21st Century'

- Continuity and Disturbance
- New Instruments in the Orchestra?
- Acoustic Instruments & Electronics, Funding and Market Forces

3.  Virtuosity and Otherness 

- Extended Techniques
- Orchestral Electroacoustics

4. Which ATS would be most effective for the 'Acoustic Orchestra of
the 21st Century'?

- Criteria
- Commitment, Availability, Cost
- Feasibility : Instruments and Performance
- Some Basic Terms  -  Just Intonation and Temperament
- Beyond the Traditional Criteria for Evaluating Alternative Tuning
Systems 
- Consonance and Dissonance
- Relating Tuning and Timbre  - from Helmholtz to Sethares (1)  
- Relating Tuning and Timbre  -  from Helmholtz to Sethares (2)=B7 
- Terhardt's 'Two-Component' Theory of Consonance 
- Intonational Tolerance and 'Zonality' 
- Large n-Division Temperaments 
- Further Mathematical and Analytic Approaches
- Provisional Conclusions

 5.  Preliminary thoughts regarding New Instruments

1
- The Voice, Guitar, Organ, & Tuned Percussion (This is unfortunately 
omitted )
