All:
	I'm sure someone has mentioned this on the forum, but I don't 
always pay attention when the talk turns to synths, so please forgive me 
if I repeat common knowledge. I just downloaded the Yamaha S-YXG50 
software synthesizer (30 day free trial) which sells for about $30.00, 
and I am really impressed. Although it is not appropriate for live 
performance due to a 500 ms delay between MIDI input and sound output, it 
has some very impressive sounds, and seems to deal really well with pitch 
bend microtonal MIDI.
