to unsubscribe from the tuning list send a message containing ONLY:

unsubscribe tuning

(No Subject: first line blank - no other content)

to

listproc@mills.edu

If you have trouble it MAY be because you are not trying to unsubscribe from
the same path you subscribed from - if so then send me mail related to
unsubscribing from tuning (I get a LOT of mail - up to 100 pieces a day -
often including messages to other lists that I am on from people having
trouble unsubscribing to them).

Most people have trouble unsubscribing either for the reason above or
because they are sending the unsubscribe message with something
relevant to the list processor in the Subject:, e.g., "unsubscribe
me".  The list processor (almost all of them) automatically rejects
such messages to avoid mail loops, especially with peer list
processors.  To disable "suspicious subjects" is paramount foolishness,
and most people can figure out the message.  If your mailer automatically
inserts subjects, then complain to your mail administrator.  Do not
just use "r" to respond to the rejection message because then you are
in one of those mail loops (qed).
