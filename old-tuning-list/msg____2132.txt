This algorithm was known by the Babylonians.  I remember this from a Math
History Course I took several years ago.  I'm not quite sure but I think 
that dates it to 1000 B.C.


Is this adaptable to the 12th root of two?  My immediate hunch is no.  It is
probably only good for roots that can be expressed as powers of 2.  I'll
have to think about it.  Maybe Mr. Canright would have something to say about
this.
