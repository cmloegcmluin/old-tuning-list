No, I only said "about halfway" and only in the case of 9:8 and 10:9.
Anyway, the difference between the two means is 0.6 cents, which is too
little to quibble over.

Well, a VERY slightly mistuned interval will be more consonant that the
freshman sum of the just interval with an equally simple one.

You've talked specifically about one kind of consonance and one kind of
dissonance. What are the two kinds of dissonance you are thinking of? (I
think I may be able to offer some answers once I'm sure what you mean).
