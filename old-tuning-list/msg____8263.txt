It seems to me it is, although it is usually more common to center it on
"C", rather than on "D", as most people find the fingerings easier this way.

I agree- if I understand what you mean by "triadic diatonic", and if we are
limited to 12 tones.  I will add that this tuning is good, even with only
12 tones, for types of music other than "triadic diatonic".  Terry Riley
has done some nice minimalist-type stuff with it on his album "The Harp of
New Albion".
