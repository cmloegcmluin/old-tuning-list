Subject: More on Xenharmonic Composition

From: Gary <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Some of you might find amusing, as did I, a reaction that an old friend of
mine had to my 88CET demo.  He's a quite well-versed amateur musician, who has
done a LITTLE bit of microtonal stuff under my guidance, and enjoyed it.  I
thought his reaction was funny in a way, cliche in another, and astute in
another.  He said (chuckling) "my main reaction to microtonal stuff is that,
'it's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it' and I'm glad you're doing it".  

   He pointed out that it all still sounds weirdly nonharmonious to him.  I told
him, in the same joking spirit, that that's what some of us live for, to find
something weirder than ever before.
