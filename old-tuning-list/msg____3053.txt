From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

How about summation tones?  Together summation and difference tones are 
combination tones.  When in synch regarding wave form, at high amplitude 
and with substantial duration, combination tones take on the effective 
status of full musical tones and generate further combinations.  This 
chain reaction is responsible for the "harmonic clouds" of La Monte 
Young's The Well-Tuned Piano.
