Subject: 10 tone sounds

From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu>

A few days ago, Brian McLaren gave us a 
list of things he thought were important.
One of those was to make a complete set of orchestral
sounds/samples spectrally mapped into all the equal
temperaments between 5 and 53.

[Mapping a sound "into" one of the temperaments
means that you move the partials so as to
maximize sensory consonance at scale steps
of the temperament. "Spectral mapping" is a signal
processing technique that does the moving of the partials.]

Good news for those of you with an ASR/EPS
sampler. Garth of "Rubber Chicken Software" 
(a third party sound developer) now has 
a 10 disk set of sounds available that are spectrally
mapped into10-tone equal temperament. 

Contact Garth at: chickenEPS@willmar.com

It's only one tuning, and its not a "complete" 
set of sounds, and many of them aren't orchestral.
But hey, its a start.
