Subject: British composers

From: Franck Jedrzejewski <franck@arthaud.saclay.cea.fr>

Gregory (in #763) quotes british composers (Brian Ferneyhough, Michael 
Finnissy, James Dillon and Chris Dench). This composers work with 
microtones.
I would like to add to the list Nigel Osborne, born in 1948.
But the "father" of all, is certainly John Foulds (1880-1939). 
He had writed a String Quartet with quarter tones in 1896 (today, lost), and
had been interrested in indian Music (see Lyra Celtica, opus 50, Concerto
for wordless medium voice and orchestra). In 1930, he was in London, writing his
book Music Today. In 1935 he established in India where he died in 1939.
