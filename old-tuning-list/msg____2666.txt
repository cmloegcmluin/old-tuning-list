Yet another possible solution might be a product called SoftWindows 
(SoftWindows 2.0 for PowerMac), which seems to be an emulator for
DOS/Windows programs. That would make Scala run a lot slower of course,
but for the majority of the commands that is not a problem.
It might be needed to play with the memory settings since not all
of the available memory is made available to DOS by SoftWindows.
