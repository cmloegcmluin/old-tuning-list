very important, and should be pursued.''

A response:

In the end, what drives a passion for music is not a set of numbers or a
piece of technology (no matter how ''elegant'' in construction), but some
very deep psychological response to the sound of a music, the way it is
articulated in time, and the way in which it resonates with an individual's
memory and imagination.. What is attractive about tuning theory is that it
is a way of getting fairly concrete handles on extremely subjective
matters. A description of a tuning system may appear to be a cold and
indirect approach to musics we respond to emotionally, but it is perhaps
the only approach that may be tested objectively and communicated
universally. If we wish to speak or write directly of emotional responses
we are forced into an adjectival deadend and communication is virtually
impossible. If however, we are driven to communicate our emotional response
to Music directly, why do we need to resort to words at all? Isn't the most
appropriate response to a piece of music a new piece of music? (This last
was something I learned from Charles Seeger).
