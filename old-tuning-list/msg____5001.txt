The first real proof of Pi's irrationality was not until the 18th  
century - I think you'll find it was either by Euler or Lambert. The  
proof pi is transcendental didn't appear till even later. But the way  
the Greeks attacked the problem of finding the ratio between a  
circle's diameter and area suggests they at least had doubts about  
pi's rationality. This is perhaps best exemplified in the way  
Archimedes, among others, made ever-finer polygonal approximations  
(of known area) to a circle, from both inside and outside, converging  
towards the "true" ratio which could never be completely attained. I  
believe he even says something to the effect that while it is false  
to believe that in this way you can "exhaust" the whole area of the  
circle, you can in fact come arbitrarily close. 


Persistent failure to properly "square the circle" -- definitely one  
of antiquity's most popular problems -- could also have sown seeds of  
doubt among the Greeks as to pi's rationality. One would imagine that  
this would have created some consternation for early Pythagoreans,  
who had rather hoped that the cosmos and everything in it worked  
according to numbers -- in fact in some sense that everything *was*  
number. But if the ratio of a circle's radius to its circumference  
was irrational, then the lengths of the celestial bodies' circular  
paths around the "Central Fire" would be incommensurable with their  
distances from it, i.e. have no common number. (This particular  
cosmological model, in favour with early Pythagoreans, had a Central  
Fire around which were placed the earth, moon, and Sun; the five  
planets known to the ancients; a fixed sphere of stars and a  
"counter-earth", perpetually invisible to us since it remained  
diametrically opposed to ours on its orbit around the central fire,  
and apparently incorporated to fudge the number of "things" out there  
to add up to ten, the so-called perfect number...)
