Subject: Mr. McLaren, Mr. Partch and Me

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

To all of you on the tuning list:

In digest 778, Mr. Brian McLaren wrote:

And that was just the beginning.

I was a member of the Harry Partch Ensemble from 1971 to 1987, and worked with
Harry for the last few years of his life.  I have played and performed on nearly
all of the Partch instrument, and have performed the majority of the Partch
repertoire.  It was, and remains, a distinct privilege and joy; it is also a
responsiblity I feel towards Harry.  You could say, as Mr. McLaren did, that I am
directly affected.

I will be posting to this mailing list some responses and opinions regarding the
present and future possibilities for the exposure and performance of the music and
works of Harry Partch.  I state here at the outset: my expertise is in his
instruments, his works and his temperament - I am *not* an expert in the rather
daunting field of intonations (all of them, in all the flavors I have seen
represented here).  I wanted that out up front.  I do, however, have considerable
interest in the discussions of the other issues, and I believe I have the
'background' to offer another (hopefully) informed view of the proceedings.  I will 
strive, as I have seen a number of others do (quite admirably) to maintain a high 
degree of civility and clearly state opinions as such, and not confuse them with 
facts.  I won't mince words.  I won't make personal attacks.  I will strive for a 
clear signal at all times.

I have been encouraged by a couple of the members privately that my thoughts would
be welcome in this forum, and it is in this light that I look forward to adding to
the corpus of knowledge herein contained.  I don't know how quick my first post
will be, but there *are* some issues that need to be addressed in a rather timely
fashion; I will endeavor to get it together pronto.  In advance of that, and at any
time, I welcome correspondence from any of you, if I may be of help.

And just so that I have it straight, this is all about music, isn't it?

Yours in harmony,
Jon
