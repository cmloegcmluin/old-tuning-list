Second post.  I think the first one fell off the edge of the world.

Someone wrote that Paul E Says:

It is true that JI has no puns, but a similar sort of joke could be done
a slightly different way.  Take Bach's Prelude (No.1 from well-tempered
Clavichord) which must be one of the punniest pieces around.

Each arpeggio is played twice, and the first time its meaning matches
the tuning of the previous arpeggio and the second time it matches the
following arpeggio.  So in JI the frequencies should reflect this and
change slightly between the first and second playing.  In most cases
some notes would stay the same and some change by small amounts such as
81/80, 64/63 and such.  It would be interesting to hear it done this
way.

OK, for the purests, that was not the intended joke.
