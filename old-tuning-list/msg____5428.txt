Subject: RE: Music healing

From: Atlas Eclipticalis <ribarbe@garlic.com>

I call attention to recent articles in the paper about a new medical
technique to affect clogged arteries near the brain in stroke victims with
focused ultra-sound and MRI scanning combined.  This is an example of sound
being used to heal.  Perhaps scientists' online net jibberish may be coming
to light.
