Subject: The Sanctity of The List

From: "Robin Perry" <jinto83@hotmail.com>

To all:

If I have implied in some way that I think a co-op among like minded
individuals should take the place of this forum, I do wish to clear the
air.  I find the digest very valuable, thought provoking, even humorous 
at times...I echo:  Long Live the List!

I would also like to voice my support for Lydia's concept of a 
Microtonal Festival on the west coast.  San Diego would be my
first choice, but L.A. or San Francisco might work just as well.

Robin
