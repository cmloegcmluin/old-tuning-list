Subject: microtonal cello & an installation at Mela Foundation NYC

From: DMB5561719@aol.com

Sorry about the shot notice....

Two very special presentations in the Chruch Street Dream House.

On Sunday June 22, at 8pm, virtuoso cellist Charles Curtis
will perform his new work, Ultra White Violet Light, for solo
cello improvised in a justly intoned melismatic style set 
against an enviroment of continuous sine tones and taped prose 
recitation. Curtis will open the concert with a set of rarely heard 
single line ballades and virelais by the 14th century master
Guillaume de Machaut.

On Sunday June 29, from 2pm to mid-night, the Dream House 
will be transformed by the frequencies of Mobile, Chord 8, a 
continuous sound installation by Michael J. Schumacher. 
Come and go through out the afternoon and evening, or 
stay the entire ten hours to hear a chord consisting of 
six intervals in just intonation unfolding in algorithmically
shifting variations, gradually illuminating the many harmonic 
combinations.

Of course Dream House: Seven Years of Sound and Light 
1993-2000 remains open Thursdays & Saturdays 2pm to midnight.
Note: closed July & August - reopens in Sept.
