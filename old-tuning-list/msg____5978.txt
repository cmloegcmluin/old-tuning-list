Subject: Re: Info sought on recordings

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

About JC's request on the Microtonal Blues Band, here's info I posted once
before. There were two LP's (both still sitting in my closet) that are long
out of print, and doubt have been transferred to CD (though 8-tracks may
still be around):

- "Journey To Bliss - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band"
(Impulse Stereo A-9166)

- "Spirit of 1976 - Emil Richards and the Microtonal Blues Band / Live at
Donte's"
(Impulse Stereo A-9182)

To be upfront about it, these are not excursions into microtonal
composition per se;  Emil and company used microtonal instruments,
virtually all of these percussion (and mostly made by Emil, I think) to add
colors to the music.  They had been influenced by Hari Har Rao, who had
recently begun teaching Indian music in the LA area at the time.  Most of
the expansion of the jazz idiom came in the form of odd meters.  They were
also being influenced by the Maharishi himself (with LP #1 having a
particularly striking oil painting of him on the back), and more than a
certainty being influenced by burning vegetation of an illegal nature
(except for medicinal purposes, of course).

It's up to the individual whether to check them out as microtonal
resources, but if you want a retro insight into the late 60's (when I
believe these were recorded) they can't be beat.  Side Two of LP #1 is
entitled "Journey To Bliss: A Meditation Suite in Six Movements".
Priceless stuff, I assure you.

Emil was turned on (hmmm...) to the Indian thing by Don Ellis, and for a
while they had a group called the Hindustani Jazz Sextet.  About that
group, I know nothing. Oh, hell, about a lot of things I know nothing.

>I imagine others on this list would like the information as well.

Well, John, we'll 'just' see about that!

Cheers all,
Jon
