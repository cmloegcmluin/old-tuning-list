Subject: Consonance coefficient

From: Antonio <anfri@mbox.vol.it>

The motive for which I have needed a list of the intervals was tied up
to the type of software that I am preparing. He, once you give the notes
of a chord, produces all his possible inversions on guitar keyboard. The
number of inversions is so high that it requires a filter that allows to
rearrange it with various criterions.
These are essentially of two types:
a) technical difficulty (fingering)
b) level of consonance

Naturally the point b is a problem so vast and open from seem me often a
pure utopia. My objective would be that of establish a "consonance
coefficient" that gathers in a number the problematic that the concept
of "consonance" implies (beating, harmonics series and many other things
that I don't know but that surely anybody of you knows well...)
Naively I've thought that this number could be synthesized in a value to
give to the various intervals that each inversion requires. For
instance:

octave=3D 12
P5=3D 11
P4=3D 10
M6=3D 9
M3=3D 8
m3=3D 7
m6=3D 6
m7=3D 5
4+=3D 4
M2=3D 3
M7=3D 2
m2=3D 1

This is only an example based upon my instinctive list of the intervals.

A triad of C would get the followings "scores":

Root position: M3, m3, P5=3D 8+ 7+ 11=3D 26
First inversion: m3, P4, m6=3D 7+ 10+ 6=3D 23
Second inversion: P4, M3, M6=3D 10+ 8+ 9=3D 27

The fact that the second inversion is, in according to this strange
"score", more consonant than root position is strange but, in effects,
in the harmonics series it appears before.

In short the principal problem is that of establish the values in the
intervals list correctly. I don't know if my method is too na=EFve, let m=
e
know. Ciao.
