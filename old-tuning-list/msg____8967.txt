Forgive my ignorance, but what is "Xeno-Gothic"?  Do you mean new music
that uses the 9/7 and 12/7 intentionally, or do you mean new music that
uses it intuitively?  I'm think you mean old music that uses it
intuitively.  In any case, can you give a time frame, location, composers'
names, and/or recommended recordings?
