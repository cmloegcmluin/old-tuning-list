<Is there such a concept as
<"relative primality"? =


Two numbers sharing no prime factors other than 1 are relatively prime.

<I'm not sure where that example is leading.  There is no V of V there of=

the
<type that I'm familiar with, which is a II chord acting as a dominant to=
 a
<following V chord.

The V chord is in a V of V relationship to the IV chord.

<If 3 and 9 had a common sound source and were in phase with each other, =
no
<place in the installation would cause 3 to phase-cancel without also
<cancelling the 9, or constructively interfere with the 3 without also
<boosting the 9.  That could not be true of any two different primes. =

Seems
<to me this one helps my argument.

You will encounter wave fronts for 9 alone in thirds of the distance
between fronts shared by 3 and 9.

<I missed the relation between your fifth example and your point.

I merely wanted to show a real example where the particular tuning is at =
a
relatively low level in the identity of a piece of music and that certain=

relationships - which may be paralleled by mathematical ideals - are not
necessarily projected materially, but are understood by listeners to be
present through cultural or compositional means.  =
