Subject: Re:Native Indian Music/Rod Poole

From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

The only extenive collections of Native American music was done by
Francis Densmore. These collections were done from the turn of the
century to the 40's. Although she makes no attempt to decyper the
tunings, she recorded these songs on Edison Disks which many are housed
at the Southwest Museum here in L.A. That none of us has investigated
this collection is a shame and all you out there could ridicule me for
not taking up the task. May my friends out there harp me to go over
there, I will. She states that they raise their fourths and lower their
sevenths(could they be attempting to reach a gibson
dischord!).Personally I have heard stories that before this time of
Densmore's collections (of individual not group renditions) that with
certain tribes the women would keep a high drone from which the song
would start or move to within the first few notes. I have tried playing
quite a few songs with an upper drone finding the effect very
convincing!! Even more so when I've used scale derived from  a
subharmonic series.
	Rod Poole who first used my 12-tone tuning Centaur found in the last
Xen., now has expanded this into a 17-limit affair (22 frets to the
octive with various open tunings). He has also done some compositions as
"The Voice of the Bowed Guitar" with 3 just open tuned guitars that are
bowed. I will update you when the recording is available.
