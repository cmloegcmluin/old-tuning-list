Wow -- guess I've been away from the List longer
than I thought.

My book is called "JustMusic: A New Harmony --
Representing Pitch as Prime Series".  It's been
about 14 years in the works.

It gives first a mathematical explanation of how ratios
can be factored into the series of prime numbers, each
prime raised to a different exponent (where any prime
to the 0th power = 1), and then these products are
multiplied together to give the ratio.

The rest of the book shows how my lattice diagrams
are designed by making use of this prime factorization,
with the diagrams becoming more and more complex
as I give an overview thru both increasing prime
limits and historical chronology.

The historical aspect gives all of the different
just-intonation tuning systems I have found in doing
my research, presented from one viewpoint, which
I have found makes it easier to understand how
different tuning theories have evolved and interacted
with each other.  

It goes back to ancient Greek and Indian systems,
and progresses all the way up to present-day
composers such as La Monte Young, Ben Johnston,
Ezra Sims, and others, with special emphasis given
to Harry Partch and Arnold Schoenberg.

As you would think by my inclusion of Schoenberg,
I have also given some reference to some of the
more popular equal-temperaments, especially
12-equal, and how some theorists have "justified"
or explained the use of these temperaments by
emphasis on their good or bad representation
of particular ratios.  Notably absent from the book
(as it stands now) is coverage of meantone and
well temperaments.

Part of the reason behind my cross-country trip
was to meet with west-coast microtonalists and
put info about their work into the later chapters.
Any of you using a particular or unique tuning
system are welcome to submit a representative
score with an explanation of the tuning.

My living situation in San Diego has not yet been
stabilized, so email me for a mailing address at:
