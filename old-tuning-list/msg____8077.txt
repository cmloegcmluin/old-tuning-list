For flexibly-pitched instruments, that's fairly on the money.

The latter meaning strikes me as more useful, and the former is just a
special case of the latter.

Barbershop harmony seems to be able to take the septimal comma, which
would be 27 cents in just intonation, and by adjusting the (harmonic
and/or melodic) intervals in the comma's context, and/or shrinking the
comma itself, make it an effective "performance comma".

I don't see it.

>(ii) list the intervals which belong to the primary m-limit; 
>(iii) find the primary m-limit interval which is least well

This certainly doesn't work for level 1 consistency. Is this the thing
that happens to work for higher levels? If so, how are you defining
"primary" and "number of additions"?

It strikes me that you're drawing a false connection between commas and
consistency, and therefore trying to kill one bird with two stones. If
the comma vanishes consistently, then all commatic situations will be
completely well-behaved by traditional criteria. If the comma doesn't
vanish, consistency (of any kind) or no, the rules that govern the
general performance situation apply. The consistency of a tuning,
relative to half a step or any other measure, is neither sufficient nor
necessary to guarantee that the commatic situations can be handled.

For the syntonic comma, calculate the difference between four 3/2s up
and a 5/4 down. If the tuning is 5-limit consistent, then this will be
the same as the (absolute) difference between three 3/2s up and a 5/3
down. In 19-tone equal temperament, four 3/2s up is 6 steps (neglecting
octaves), and that is the 5/4, so the comma is 0 steps. In 22-tone equal
temperament, four 3/2s up is 8 steps, but the 5/4 is 7 steps, hence the
comma is 1 step.
