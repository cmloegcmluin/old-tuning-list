That's right!
Mr. Kubota prepared his system in a microtuning way to make it suitable to the
 monthly Jam that I'm holding...named "SaRiGaMa's Oil Vending Orchestra".
I'm not sure how he is translating the 3D-Mandel thing into MIDI file but the
 files at the URL you poited out are based on the PD-file-sharing project named
 "Hz on Hz":

The idea is to have the root moving and the co-overtone 233.609Hz hidden as 
a invisible gravity....
Click the gif thing and you'll get into the Hz linkage project which is also
 waiting for YOUR contribution.
Thanx!
