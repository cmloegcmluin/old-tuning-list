Subject: Microtonality in San Diego

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

RE Tuning Digest 1187: For some reason, I've missed #1186, but the
discussion in #1187 looks interesting.

BTW: Ivor Darreg's newsletter was called the Xenharmonic Bulletin
(subtitled in Greek letters, Xenharmonia, followed by the Greek
numeral) but Ivor was living in the LA area when he began its
publication.Ivor also (self)published a number of other articles
and reports  on musical topics from his various addresses in the
LA and SD areas.

My journal is called Xenharmonikon (with a K) and I started
publishing it when I was living in New Jersey and working for
Merck. It has travelled with me from NJ to Texas, Berkeley, etc.
and Daniel Wolf edited and published issues 9-13. Some issues of
Darreg's Xenharmonic Bulletin were included in the early
issues of XH as were some other articles by him as well.

Interval was published by Jonathan Glasier in San Diego and
Ivor was on the board. Glasier now runs the Sonic Arts Gallery
with his wife Elizabeth, though reportedly, the space is now partly
devoted to antiques and objects other than musical instruments.

The Sonic Arts Gallery has also been a venue for microtonal performances,
though not recently due to the absence of Brian McLaren. While
microtones sometimes may be heard at the Center for World Music, UCSD,
the Spruce Street Forum, etc., the SG has been the only space dedicated
to contemporary microtonality in San Diego. Alas, it's not been very
active recently and the Partch Instruments have been moved from San
Diego State University (SDSU) to Purchase, NY.

As Jon mentioned, microtonal activities are at a pretty low ebb in
SD.
