Subject: Harmonics, Partials, Overtones

   I've always taken partials to mean:
* "Partials" to mean frequency components of a sound whether or not they
are 
  harmonically related.
* "Overtones" to mean essentially the same as partials, but implying 
  frequency components above the perceived pitch of the tone as a whole.
* "Harmonics" to mean partials that are in fact harmonically related.

   Unfortunately, I don't think there's any realistic way out of "harmonic"
having two meanings, those of musical harmony and of integer-frequency
relationships.  I say that because "harmonic" is already a mathematical
term to that effect, and I don't think that anybody would be interested in
purging the music world of words whose root is "harmony".
