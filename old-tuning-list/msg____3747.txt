Subject: RE: guide to non-tempered synthesizers

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

One variety of Ensoniq's VFX that Brian did not mention is the VFX-SD, which 
I own. It only has one programmable _system_ tuning, but each patch can 
include a pitch-table, so you can have a different tuning for each 
instrument, if you like. Gary's point about the split points is well-taken, 
especially if you have some low notes mapped to high keys or vice versa.

Steve Curtin of Ensoniq has informed me that the pitch resolution of the VFX 
line is not 768 steps per octave, as he originally stated, but is in fact 
512 steps per octave. This seems correct given my expereince that the 
nominal size of an interval needs to be incremented by usually 2, sometimes 
3, cents before the rate of beating changes.

In light of Brian's more recent post of the state of microprocessor 
technology in the world of synthesizers, Michael Vannice's claim that Marion 
Systems' synths give 512 steps per semitone (revised from 512 steps per 
cent!) or 6144 steps per octave seems unlikely. Then again, Brian's reports 
on technology are not always accurate (CD-R, for instance), but the tuning 
resolution of sysnths seems to be one thing that he would know something 
about.
