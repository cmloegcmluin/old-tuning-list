The Well Tuned Piano by La Monte Young
is long out of print, I will be hosting a
listening session at:

     The Dream House 
     on April 26th at 3:00 p.m.
     275 Church Street, 3rd floor
     N.Y., N.Y.

     between White & Franklin, 
     3 1/2 blocks south of Canal St.

Come prepared to spend 5 hours listening to 
this important work and landmark recording.
