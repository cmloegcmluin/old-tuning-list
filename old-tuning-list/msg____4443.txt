Subject: Re: pure or just

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

The early nod to the English use of just harmonies, implying at the very
least a decidedly smaller third than the ditone on the continent, is here
quoted from the Strunk collection of first hand accounts on music of the
Middle Ages.

The English Origin of Polyphonic Music, attributed to Giraldus Cambrensis:
"Descriptio Cambriae" (12th Century)

"The Britons do not sing in unison, like the inhabitants of other
countries, but in many different parts.  So that when a company of singers
among the common people meets to sing as is usual in this country, as many
different parts are heard as there are performers, who all at length unite
in consonance, with organic sweetness."


What do you think, sound just to y'all?
