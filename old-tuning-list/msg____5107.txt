Well, first of all, thanks for such an interesting and penetrating
question.

Yes it is true that the augmented sixth as expressed in meantone (and
even in 5-limit Just Intonation) is very close to the 4-5-6-7 chord. In
1/4 comma meantone the aug6 is only 3 cents flat of its 7-limit version
(in J.I. it is just 7.7 cents sharp).

The former certainly gives a very good (and the latter a pretty
reasonable) aural analogue of 4-5-6-7, and as a 7-limit major tetrad it
sounds very well tuned.

So it does appear that there is a danger that an augmented sixth chord
could lose its restlessness (i.e its function), but it must not be
forgotten that the aug6th is a "highly chromatic" chord (as Paul Erlich
correctly comments).

In classical music of the meantone period, the augmented sixth is
usually found built on the flat 2 or flat 6 of the scale.

The spelling of bVIaug6 in C major would be Ab-C-D-F# or Ab-C-Eb-F#. The
notes Ab, F# and Eb will seek to resolve by moving a minor second
(diatonic semitone) in the direction of their alteration (this being the
usual resolution of a chromatic note). Furthermore in the first version
of the augmented sixth, the augmented fourth between Ab and D is highly
dissonant (the meantone aug4, which is very close to 7/5, only seems to
be consonant when it is part of a 4-5-6-7, 5-6-7, or 4-5-7 chord).

The spelling of bIIaug6 in C major would be Db-F-G-B or Db-F-Ab-B. Once
again a highly chromatic chord in C major - the first has an augmented
fourth with the bass, the second has two chromatic notes.

For these reasons it is unlikely that an augmented sixth can function as
a tonic, despite its consonance.

So, if a consonant (virtually 4-5-6-7) chord can be used as an aug6th
chord why not use a 4-5-6-7 chord as a dominant (or indeed secondary
dominant)?

The augmented sixth chord sounds like a 4-5-6-7 chord by *chance*, there
is no design here. The origin of this chord was not the result of a
quest to maximise the consonance of a dominant seventh type chord, but
to serve as a chromatic substitution for (alteration of) the second
inversion of the dominant 7th whose *bass* note is a chromatic semitone
above the aug6th's root (that, at least, is the conventional explanation
for its origins).

To actively choose 4-5-6-7 for a (secondary) dominant 7th, is to quite
consciously introduce another note foreign to the major scale. In C
major the 7/4 of the dominant chord is a note more than 27 cents below
F, and as we have seen is well represented (in meantone) by the
augmented 6th E#. If composers really wanted to minimise the dissonance
of the dominant seventh, it would not have been beyond the notational
possibilities of the time to spell G7 as G-B-D-E#. But no composer does
this (unless of course the chord resolves *as an aug6th* (i.e. to F#
major).

To use this aug6th with the dominant chord consistently, one would have
to reconstruct the C major scale as an 8 note scale - C, D, E, E#, F, G,
A, B. But this E# only functions as a useful consonance in the G7 chord
- it is a note which can only serve in one chord position (7/4 type
seventh) in one chord (the 4-5-6-7 chord whose root is G).  All the
other notes can serve as root, third or fifth (and seventh etc.) except
for F - which can't be a fifth, and B - which can't be a root.
Furthermore it is only related to the other scale notes as a 7-limit
ratio when the very foundation of the major (and minor scales) are the 3
and 5-limit ratios of the major and minor triads. It is therefore a
somewhat superfluous and *unintegrated* note with respect to the C major
scale.

To use this extra-scalic E# (#3) is, therefore, a conscious and explicit
device which is useful for only one purpose, and that purpose is to
minimise the natural dissonance of the dominant seventh chord.

BUT, it is important to remember that it should not be the purpose of a
tuning system to remove all dissonance. Dissonance is the driving energy
of music. In counterpoint the alternation of consonance and dissonance
is fundamental to good form, and indeed without dissonance, creativity
is, perhaps, impossible. In relation to a quite different discussion on
the MTO-List, Nicholas Meeus wrote on 6th March 97:

Alternative tunings enable us to create strange and wonderful
consonances not available to 5-limit tuning, but at the same time it is
quite wrong to use tuning to eradicate all dissonances where-ever we
find them. Dissonance must be embraced not discarded.

This is certainly an intriguing idea, and it makes one wonder if any
classical composers or theorists of the time were aware of, or
discussed, the unexpected consonance of the aug6th chord.
