Subject: CDR Recording Problems - Mac

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Please forgive the length of this post, but since Brian pointed out that
CDR-writing technology isn't quite there, I figured I'd ask a friend who's been
monitoring the situation, if the Mac situation might be a little different.
Since Macs have been in the "DAW" (Digital Audio Workstation) market for several
years longer than PCs, perhaps the situation might be better.

Well, given the temperment of some subscribers to daw-mac, if all CD-R burners 
yielded 60% error rates, there would be fires, pipe-bombs and assasinations of 
company execs!!!

The "image file" requirement seems to be dependent on both software and
hardware. 
Generally 4x writes require it, 2x don't. I think I read recently that Toast 
CD-Pro software may NOT require an image file (but I'm not sure if that's for 
4x writes.) 4x writes do seem to require a lot of user overhead, and are very 
dependent on fast hard drives, busses, uninterrupted CPU time, etc.

Multiple session writes seem to be hardware dependent, so machines support it, 
some don't. Again, your software has to support it also. It apparently is NOT 
highly recommended because certain track info is only written to disk when 
you are done, so your file integrity is in jepardy until then. Handling the disk

between sessions could render it unusable.

>From what I can tell from daw-mac, seems like most people are happy with their 
Yamaha CD-R, both CDE-100 and CDE-102 gets good marks. Digidesign MasterList CD 
and Astarte Toast (various versions) also seem popular. 

I have no idea about half-life. I've never heard any complaints, but who knows? 
They ARE delicate, so storage and handling are important (who touches their 
audio CDs anyway?) 

Either Electronic Musicain or Keyboard (maybe both) recently ran an article 
comparing various CD-R options.

Below are a few daw-mac related mesaages.

According to my latest price list, Masterlist CD has dropped in price to
$495 US. The only problem with the CD DA software is that it requires
Digi's sound drivers in order to play back through your Digi setup,
which in my case wouldn't work. I have used Toast for non audio stuff in
the past and it works well.

The Yamaha is a great drive... very reliable and well made.

CD-ROM Pro is good but it is better for things like backups than it is 
for audio discs.  CD-DA is their audio disk software and is very nice.  
With CD ROM Pro you have no control over PQ coding and such so you're 
stuck with 2 second gaps and, I believe, track-at-once mode.

For anyone planning on purchasing a new CD burner or thinking of 
getting some new CD-R software, there is a must-see article titled:
"CD Recordable Software, A Macintosh Compendium" published in
the June, 1996 issue of a magazine called CD-ROM Professional.
ISSN- 1049 - 0833,   Online, Inc.,   462 Danbury Road, Wilton CT
phone 203-761-1466
 
The (7) page article includes an excellent overview of all of the differences
between the various multimedia and audio formats.  The best part of this
article, however, has to be the (2) full pages of Feature Comparison Charts 
which show exactly which features in each of (8) CD-R programs will 
work on each of (7) single disc CD-R burners and (6) jukeboxes.
 
Although some of the articles in this magazine are available on the net at:
         http://www.onlineinc.com/cdrompro/index.html   
this article is not included.
 
The classified ads in this mag are also worth taking a look at.  There is an 
outfit which will supply blank CDRs which have custom screen printing 
already applied, and there are lots of sources of blank discs, with some at 
prices as low as US $ 5.95 ea.
 
Hope this helps somebody.

Yes, we have one and use it all the time, both for CDROM back up and
Masterlist CD audio mastering.
