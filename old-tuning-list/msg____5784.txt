Some ET's cannot be generated by their best fifth, e.g. 24 and 34. I
like to see meantone systems as 2-D even if octave equivalence is
assumed, since meantone systems are meant to approximate 5-limit JI.
Topologically, meantone tunings wrap the 5-limit plane onto an infinite
cylinder. I like to see ETs as having as many dimensions as odd factors
with which they are consistent. ETs consistent with the 5-limit wrap
said plane onto a torus. 22tET can be considered 5-dimensional because
it consistently represents all ratios of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. If we allow
skipping of 13, we can add 15 and 17 and treat 22tET as a 7-dimensional
tuning! Of course, one doesn't need a very large portion of the lattice
to cover all 22 notes . . .
