Subject: Re: NeXT.Just.tar.Z

From: Bill Parod <parod@baris.acns.nwu.edu>

Kami,

Here is the unformatted overview from the on-line help for Just.
There are a couple of versions 'out there'. The latest version  
supports midi in, so you can play tunings from a midi keyboard. If  
your version doesn't do that and you wish to, let me know. Also the  
newer version is FAT so it will run on Intel-NeXTStep as well as NeXT  
hardware. 


If you need more help, let me know.

Overview

This application provides a means of exploring  arbitrary tuning  
systems using standard representations (pitch, musical interval,  
cents, frequency, and ratio), as well as exploiting theoretical  
systems such as Just Intonation and N-tone equal temperament.  The  
application organizes these features into two main window styles and  
a few auxiliary panels. The two window styles:  Keyboard and Matrix,  
contain Keys that may be tuned and played with the mouse or MIDI  
keyboard.  A Tuning Panel provides controls that are used to tune,  
play, compare, or change the representation of selected keys.

The user may also play standard NeXT and MIDI score files.  These  
scores may be retuned from tuning information in Keyboard or Matrix  
Windows.

Keyboard Windows

Keyboard windows contain an arbitrary number of marimba style keys.   
Keys are sounded by clicking with the mouse.  Multiple keys may be  
selected at one time.  This is useful for listening to chords, or  
examining relationships within a subset of a tuning. 


Keys are moved within or between Keyboards with the standard cut,  
copy, and paste mechanisms. Each Key may be tuned and presented in a  
variety of representation styles: 


	Pitch
	Cents Relative to a Reference Key
	Cents Relative to the Previous Key
	Hertz
	Ratio Relative to a Reference Key
	Ratio Relative to the Previous Key
	Interval from Reference Key
	Interval from Previous Key
	MIDI Key Number
	User Label (arbitrary names, i.e Do, Re, Mi)

Matrix Windows 


There are two types of Matrices available: Transpositional and  
Extended Just. Each presents a palette of ratios to be used in the  
formation of new Keyboards, although representation is not restricted  
to ratios. Any of the above tuning representations may be used. 


A Transposition matrix is formed by selecting two keyboards as axes,  
and creating a matrix consisting of each keyboard transposed by each  
step of the other.

An Extended Just Matrix also provides a system of ratios. Each axis  
represents powers of a specified ratio, reduced and brought to within  
an octave of the origin (1/1),  which is centered in the matrix.  

	
Tuning a Keyboard or Matrix

The Tuning Panel is the mechanism used to tune a key or change its  
representation.  Controls in the Tuning Panel are applied to the last  
key played. The desired representation or tuning style for individual  
Keys or an entire Keyboard/Matrix are chosen with the Tuning Panel.   


Tuning a Score

Once a tuning is described, it may be used to affect the performance  
of a score.  Re-tuning a score is accomplished by installing a  
Keyboard's tuning as the default tuning system for Musickit  
performance. A score may be heard with a variety of tunings by  
installing those from different Keyboards.
