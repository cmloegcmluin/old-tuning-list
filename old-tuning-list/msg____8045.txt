Aha!  I've updated the website this evening so, among other
things, there is a quick explanation of matrices for equal
temperaments.  It's at the bottom of the "Linear
Temperaments" page that has always been there.  URL for this
is http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/lintemp.htm .

I'll add an Equal Temperament page, including a discussion
of consistency and that matrix description of 88CET, maybe
at the weekend.
