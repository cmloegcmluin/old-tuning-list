Subject: Re: pop in microtones

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Perhaps microtones is -- and has already been -- part and parcel of pop.
Without getting too specific at first about what _pop_ is, comtemplate the
following if you will.

Blues, heavy metal, rap, and much of music for commercials (unusual
music needed for quick sell).

Beach Boys and Pink Floyd are regularly in just intonation.  Whitney
Houston and Albert King and Odetta and Louis Armstrong are regular
practitioners of microtones.

Globalization of world music brings in the microtonal musics of Bulgaria,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, et al.

The pedigree of Charles Ives for theory, intentioin, and compositions
leads to microtone useage by composers Aaron Copland, Bela Bartok, Pierre
Boulez, Gyorgy Liggeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, et al.

International pioneering by Partch, Wyschnegradsky, Haba, Fokker,
Carrillo, et al. lead to new generations of micros, that beget even more
recent generations.

Right now in New York, microtones are mainstream.  Within the last 10
years there has been a lead microtonalist at each newspaper and radio
station in the city.  Denver, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and other cities provide microtonal institutions.

And yes, there are numbers of rock bands around the country, if not the
world, many on this list.  Microtonal distinction is part of what
gives that special sound to a new musician or a musical group.  Time to
stopping looking into the books and smell the coffee.  Microtones are here
to stay. :)
