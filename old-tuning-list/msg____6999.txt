Sorry, IC = Integrated Circuit = analog or digital electronic device from
as simple as a logic gate to as complex as a Digital Signal Processor or
Pentium microprocessor.  All audio level processing in today's synthesizers
and samplers occurs in each manufacturer's custom ICs (a few use
off-the-shelf DSPs).

I guess I'm confused whether you want more "Partials" to accomplish
microtonal scales or better sampling.

I was talking about the Microzone, but I can see now the distinction.  The
Microzone has just black or white keys, all one size, and no "new" types of
control.  I'm sure the reason is purely economics.
