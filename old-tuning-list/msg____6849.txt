   That in turn touches upon the question of whether it's really wise to
substitute the word "dissonant" for "discordant", as so many of us do.
Dissonance is a measure of the need to resolve, which is context-sensitive.
Discordance on the other hand, is a measure of harmonic tension of a chord
in isolation, which is inherently context-INsensitive.

   So a G major chord and a C major chord are equally discordant (that
being rather NONdiscordant), but in the key of C major, a G chord is much
more dissonant than a C chord.

   (And just why the heck is there no antonym for "discordant"?!  @#$%!)

   In short then, the case for the idea that horizontal and vertical
aspects of music can't be taken in isolation, is based upon the premise
that dissonance is every bit as much a function of its place in the
counterpoint as it is upon its discordance.  That premise is, at least
historically speaking, totally undeniable.  But perhaps it is debatable
with respect to this particular discussion, or with respect to its
relevance to, say, atonal music.
