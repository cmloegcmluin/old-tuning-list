   Thanks Bill, for posting this.  The web page is also very interesting.

   I haven't read the entire article yet, but at first blush, there is one
thing about this however that strikes me as iffy:  This apparent flute's
embouchure hole (the hole you blow across) has been destroyed, so it's very
difficult to be sure of its length.  That not being known, it would be
impossible to tell what tuning it plays.

   One other nitpicky thing:  Calling it between 43,000 and 82,000 years
old is a kind of weird way to treat numerical precision.  If you're not
sure how many TENS of thousands of years old the thing is, then how many
individual thousands on top of that is irrelevant.  But that's a minor
question.
