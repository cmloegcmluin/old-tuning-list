The term "Gleichschwebenden Temperatur" for equal temperament was 
certainly in use in Bach's time, and I think you are right...Bach would 
have had *The Equal Tempered Clavier* if that was his explicit aim.

There was no absolute pitch concept in the Baroque period so an A could 
be almost anywhere in the range of an octave, usually dependent on the 
church organ nearby.  Since some of the keys in well temperaments mirror 
equal temperament, of course writing for lute in this fashion would be no 
problem.  Keep in mind that Bach favored the freless cello for continuo 
over the freted gamba, implying that it was need for its pitch 
flexibility.

It would have been easier to reach for a perfectly just chord on a 
fretless instrument than to to try reaching for an equally-tempered 
chord.  If not for serious ear-training in equal temperament, one could 
never navigate logarithmic equal distances of _any_ interval.  At least 
the just harmonies are contained inherently in the harmonics of the 
strings themselves.

Remember that that Baroque violin had a bow that could easily play 4-note 
chords, forcing modern violinists to arpeggiate and increasing the 
difficulty of getting the piece across.  He was certainly practical 
enough not to trust any great writing to the bassoons, which during his 
time and vicinity, were poorly played and unreliable instruments. It was 
indeed a practical concern that one wrote music that could be played in 
different places by different performers...and possibly in slightly 
different tunings.

Neil, I haven't seen anything on the list about MICROSTOCK.  Care to 
elaborate? (smile)
