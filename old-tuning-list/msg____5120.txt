For me also, everything is related.  But science is not an explanation
it is a model.  Any model is most likely not exactly correct but that
does mean that there are some things with which it cannot ever deal.

I would like to word this differently.  I would say the limits of
"science as it is practiced".  In principle, science can be applied to
anything.  That it is not is only a human shortcoming.

In recent years I have come to understand through my scientific research
that many matters that are normally considered mystical or religious can
be understood scientifically also if only we have prepared the ground
beforehand.  That many scientists and others reject such matters is a
statement about their shortcomings rather than the limits of science.
