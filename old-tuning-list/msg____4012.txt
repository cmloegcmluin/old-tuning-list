   I've pondered that in a slightly different light.  I suppose to some degree
that depends on what you mean by "keyboard".  Are you refering to the raw,
internal keyboard mechanism (like those by FATAR or whoever) minus the internal
electronics and then building a custom electronic and case setup around both?
Or by "keyboard" do you mean a complete, off-the-shelf keyboard product, like
for example a couple of DX-7s (or whatever) stacked close atop one another?  

   If you mean the latter, then I see two problems to deal with:
1.  The top keyboard will still be quite a bit above the bottom one, to the 
    point where it's not terribly practical to finger both at the same time.
    To a fair degree this applies to the individual mechanisms as well in a 
    custom case.  The internal mechanisms aren't a whole lot narrower than
    finished products.  
2.  The top keyboard obscures the control buttons of the lower keyboard.
