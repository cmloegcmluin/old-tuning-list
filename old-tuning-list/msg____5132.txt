If you were to search for the "Music of The Spheres", any obvious
candidate would be derived from Pi.
 
It may well be that John "Longitude" Harrison (re?)-discovered
the tuning of the "Music Of the Spheres", and described it in the 
late 1700's.
 
I have yet to find anyone who would seriously argue against it 
being a very good (if not the optimal) negative meantone tuning.
Nevertheless we still lack "scientific proof" (or dis-proof), that 
it is the best way to model musical intervals and musical harmony.
 
To find out more, listen, discover, experiment, and have fun with it;
 
point your board to:

Anybody wanna buy a comet? (This is a time limited offer)
(Orders rec'd from the western hemisphere, before Sunday,
will also get a free total lunar eclipse). 
 
lucy (if it makes you feel any better: it's raining in Hawaii today,
the volcano has stopped flowing into the sea, and we have been having
lotsa earthquakes recently.)
 
Hence electro-magnetic emissions like this missive.
