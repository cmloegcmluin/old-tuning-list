Funny, I thought the keyboard sound was a very accurate emulation of an 
acoustic piano. Maybe James was sitting in an acoustically unfortunate 
location (I was in the rear alcove). The "Dorian" scale sounded to me like 
1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 5/3 7/4 2/1, with a flatted fifth of some sort thrown 
in. However, I could be wrong because there was a distinctly out-of-tune 
fifth in there somewhere (although maybe that was just the interval between 
the 7/4 and the 8/3). The frantic arpeggios seemed to be a means of 
projecting the pure, resonant coinciding overtones that resulted from the 
pure tuning. I suppose the faster the arpeggios are, the less variation is 
heard in the intensity of these overtones, as all the phase-cancellation and 
reinforcement would average out, but I was surprised at how the overtones 
did not seem to be subject to the attack or inevitable release (how many 
notes can the Korg sustain at once? infinity?) of the notes. Anyone know how 
LaMonte does it? I think I read that he claimed to have such a fine control 
of timing that he could make a certain overtone resonate by repeatedly 
striking a key ar keys just at the crest of its cycle. Is this really 
humanly possible?
