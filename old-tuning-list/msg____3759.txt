I think I agree very much with you here. We don't hear square waves in terms 
of their individual components, we just hear the fundamental of each 
(incomplete) harmonic series and associate a (hollow, buzzy) timbre with 
them. Now did you find that other relationships, such as powers of 2.718, 
could not evoke cognitive similarity?
