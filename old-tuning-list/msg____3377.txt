That's how it was when we had the Partch instruments in San Diego, too (must
be a Left Coast kind-of thing...).  Our only stipulation to the audience was
that they refrain from playing on the cloud-chamber bowls with platform
shoes (it was the 70's, ya know!)  For the record, as reported in the BHPS
newsletter (11/12/95) re: Newband at Lille Festival:

"After the applause finally died down, with the house lights up high, a
crowd of interested people, including me, stampeded towards the stage area,
as if at a pop concert.  Dean is a most approachable person, and despite the
demands of the performance, seemed quite happy to answer questions, allowed
us to crawl all over the instruments - except the cloud-chamber bowls, which
were very carefully packed away - so I too have touched a chromelodeon."
(Roger Merrick)

It was always great fun for us to hang out with the audience, answer any
questions, demonstrate the instruments up close.  Only drag was if we had a
load-out from the venue.  Many a late night...

Cheers,
Jon
