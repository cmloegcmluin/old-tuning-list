   Does my slow response tell you anything?

   No sorry, the reason why I haven't responded is that I'm about 130
messages behind when I went off to work day and night for a couple weeks on
a presentation for work.  But I'm back now.

   That sort of thing is part of the reason why you folks haven't heard
much from the Xenharmonic Alliance recently:  Finding the time - especially
to do all of the page-layout work on the directory - is difficult.

   Another part of they reason why I haven't worked on it much is the
tuning list.  The XH Alliance's purpose has been to foster communication
between xenharmonic musicians, as Ivor did with all of his letters.  But
not long after I joined the tuning list, it became apparent that the list
has easily done ten times as much as to foster communication between
xenharmonic musicans than I alone could accomplish with the XH Alliance.

   But only for certain xenharmonikers of course.  About half of the XH
Alliance members report having no Email.  Is it worth it for them?  Some of
them also don't like having information about them posted electronically.
It's kinda funny though how little resources it takes to be on the net
these days.  One of the XH Alliance members had an internet address, but no
home address.  Yes, he was homeless!  (Well, he had a mailing address, but
it wasn't his home.)  He had a friend at a local university who created a
Unix account for him, and he'd just periodically pop in and answer Email,
and then go back out onto the street for a while.

   As for your question though (is there one?), well, I'd like to think
that I'm still "doing" the XH Alliance, but in just a background mode.
Unfortunately, for all realistic purposes, the amount of background
processing time my CPU is spending on it makes it. practically speaking,
dormant.

   Any of you folks have any thoughts on all that?
