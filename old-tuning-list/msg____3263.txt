OK, I don't think there's anything wrong with this, although my particular 
work does propose a way to integrate the 7LIA, or more accurately the 
7-limit chord approximations, into a scale. However, I believe this approach 
has more validity that you may give it credit for. The "correlating 
melodic-harmonic consistency" is what makes polyphonic music as we know it 
possible.

In analyzing Bach, we use a heptatonic framework, i.e., the intervals are 
described not in terms of the tuning system but in terms of a scale, however 
ficticious this scale may be in practice. The reason is that the 
preponderance of heptatonic (diatonic) melodic patterns, out of which the 
harmony materializes, causes the listener to conceptualize harmonic as well 
as melodic relationships in those terms. Motivically, a major second can be 
re-interpreted as an augmented second, but never as a minor third, even 
though the latter two intervals may sound the same. The reason is the 
overarching heptatonic framework; moreover, whatever coloristic alterations 
may occur to the "canonical" scale formation will preserve or enhance the 
harmonic consonance-dissonance relationships embodied in the scale. When 
these relationships are not preserved, e.g., when a perfect fifth becomes a 
diminished fifth, we upset the prevailing heptatonic hierarchy. Thankfully, 
because of the special place of the diminished fifth within the "canonical" 
heptatonic scale, a new hierarchy, i.e., a new key center, is immediately 
established.

Of course, it wouldn't be if Bach's music didn't follow through with this 
logic. Wagner's music, although based on (almost) the same tuning system, 
may not observe this heptatonic logic, and so it is not always useful for 
analyzing his music. A framework such as Vogel's may then be more 
appropriate (he analyses some Wagner in terms of 7LCAs), and/or a framework 
which recognizes 12 distinct pitch-classes. If your music leans more towards 
microtonal Wagner than microtonal Bach, then I would agree that talk of 
scales may not be too relevant.
