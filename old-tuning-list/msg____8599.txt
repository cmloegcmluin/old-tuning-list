Subject: I need money - please buy my book

From: monz@juno.com

I would not be posting this message if
I were not truly desperate.

I moved to San Diego and started a business
which I thought would make me enough money
to solve my financial problems. 

So far, the things that are happening in microtonal
music for me and the others with whom I'm
associated, seem truly magical.

However, my business is not getting off the ground
AT ALL, and I need money badly.

I would like to offer my book to anyone who is
interested, at its current stage of completeness
(about 90 - 95% finished), for $43 US ($40 for
the book and $3 postage).  Anyone who buys
a copy now is entitled to a free copy of the completed
book when it is published.

If interested, email me, and send a check or money
order to:

Joe Monzo
2225 29th Street
San Diego, CA  92104-5424

Thanks in advance for all replies.

- Monzo
