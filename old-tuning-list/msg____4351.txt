   This missive is to respond to recent Harrison/Lucy comments

   1. Thanks Manuel. Yes Hawaii is Paradise after London.
   If I remember correctly, it was Jorgensen, who got the pi
   calcuations completely wrong, so beware and check his arithmetic.
   The article in Pitch was mine, about ten years ago.
   You'll also find a crit. from Doty in 1/1 a few years ago.

   As far as I remember, Doty got his arithmetic correct, yet
   insisted on comparing everything to integer frequency ratios,
   which of course entirely missed the significance of
   the beating.
  
  
  2. For information on "pop" (commercial use of LucyTuning) in the
  real economic music business see Arc Angel's website.

  3. Thoughts about patents and copyrights.
  Yes, I have patented, copyrighted and trademarked much of
  my work associated with LucyTuning. The reasons are
  strictly economic. To attract investment and commercial
  credibility, in the present economic system the game
  requires that intellectual property be protected.
  
  When I am paid royalties, awards, fees, profits etc.
  I use them for further work and my family's survival.
  We must all be aware of the moral shortcomings of
  the present distribution of wealth in present times, yet
  to build for the future we live in the present and
  in consequence I have to play by the economic rules
  of the present. Amiga made great computers in their day,
  yet now they are "dead", due to financial and economic
  conditions.
  I wish to avoid the same mistakes and develop a
  sound financial base for the encouragement of
  microtunings, of which there are many varieties.
  LucyTuning is to my mind the most practical, flexible,
  and logical development from 12tet as it can also
  be used to "re-interpret" existing compositions
  as well as providing a viable model for the future.
  I respect the work of others at the "edge", and
  value their ideas. My direction remains the same -
  to replace 12et with a "better" system.
  I therefore appeal to all interested in tuning to
  encourage instrument manufacturers to improve
  tuning resolution to benefit all of us.
  The MIDI tuning dump seems like a good first step in that
  direction.
