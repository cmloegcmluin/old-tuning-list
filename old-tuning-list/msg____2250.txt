Subject: Re: Question: Equal temperament in ancient China?

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Since the clavichord was introduced, this is no basis for equal 
temperament.  As many know, the clavichord is structurally designed so 
that the pitch rises when a key is pressed harder.  Essentially, pitch is 
substituted for dynamics when the player increases the pressure on the keys.

If the Chin - a Chinese Zither hanging on the wall of Chinese philosphers 
- with its ancient notation that often leaves the player playing even 
after the sound has ceased to become audible, was matched with the barely 
audible clavichord, it is probably on this esoteric level that the 
clavichord was introduced.
