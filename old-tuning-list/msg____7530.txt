From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

This came to me re: trautonium so I forward it for your collective
examination.  Additionally, Josip Slavensky of the former Yugoslavia
composed for microtonal trautonium and we presented this 2 movement work
in 1989 in an arrangement at the Yamaha Communication Center in NYC as
part of an AFMM concert.  Slavensky's piece is called "Music For
Natur-Tone System."

   The Deutsche Welle recently telecast a half-hour film about
Paul Hindemith's pupil Oskar Sala and his trailblazing Trautonium
- which he named in honor of an even earlier pioneer of electronic
music.

   The current telephone book contains this:

   Sala, Oskar - Leistikowstr. 5, [D-14050 Berlin] - (4930) 304-
4552.

   Good luck!
