I am not sure what to make of Haverstock's message about scary music.
We all receive audio input in different ways -- in the light of
experience and other things like genetics.  I do not know to whom
H. referred as creating scary music, but I do know that when I am
stressed out I want to listen to angular music, mainly Birtwistle as
it happens, as it takes the anger away.  Other people seem to get
angry at the same music and seem to think that it is a personal insult
to have discords.

So is the music "weird" or is it the listeners?  Who is normal?
Without naming pieces or composers I have no idea how much weight to
place upon this message.


I have discovered talking to composer-friends that what I see as
emotionally charged, and deeply sensual, they describe as cold and
mathematical (and I have no idea how something can be both cold and
mathematical!) 

So more details please.
