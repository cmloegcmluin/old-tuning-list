Subject: I V I  vi ii V I? An informal survey.

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

I have received a number of solutions (both on and off list) to the problem
of playing this simple progression

I  V  I   vi  ii  V  I

in Just Intonation. Of ten responses (a convenient number for statistics),
four fell into the comma slipping - or wandering tonic - category, three
wanted to introduce a 40/27 into the series of descending fifths in the
fundamentals (the exact position varying presumably with the phrasing or
rhythmic/metric context), two respondents were willing to play the ii chord
with a 40/27 fifth, and surprisingly only one suggested leaving the minor
chords pythagorean.
