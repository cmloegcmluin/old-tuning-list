Subject: Microtuning for the masses!

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

My MIDI Relay program, which runs in Windows and adds pitch bends in real
time, is now available from www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm for free.
Yes, no money, no address in North America and no fax machine required.

I've also put a few documents on that website, but nothing that should be
new to anyone who's been paying attention to this list for the past year.
Really, there should be some MIDI files to illustrate the scales, and
maybe in a few weeks there will be.
