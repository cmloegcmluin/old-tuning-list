   Interesting!  Therein lies the difference between a fellow with a piano
background (Brian), and, for lack of a better word, a solo-instrument
background (me).  In my life, I have played (mostly) viola, bassoon,
classical guitar, and now soprano saxophone, rather than piano, organ, or
harpsichord for example.  That being the case, the idea of having the
entire musical pitch range laying out in front of me simultaneously is
alien to me.  

   Limited range on an instrument is, on the face of it, a limitation, but
in another sense it's something of a liberator in that lack of range on a
single instrument never even would have occured to me as being problematic.
 I've just always assumed that if I'm writing something for the entire
musical pitch range, that I'll have to think in terms of a larger ensemble
than a single instrument.  Or driving it the other direction, devise the
ensemble that makes sense for a particular impression I'm trying to get
across, and let the range fall as it might for that particular ensemble.  

   But along the lines of piano overdubbing Brian mentioned, I suppose
there is one fairly natural way to approach that, which is the old "piano
four hands" approach.
