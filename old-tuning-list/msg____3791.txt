Hello Xenharmonisists,

I was sans provider for awhile and I missed you folks.

I am still looking for a 4 pole pickup for my Vox hollow body bass.

Can anyone recommend a simple downloadable program (nonMidi, Mac)? Just
something I could mess around with.

Does anyone know of any microtonal concerts in the near future in Los Angeles?

When will LaMonte Young be around to play for his alma mater?

Who are those shoes in the back seat of Calvin's car?
