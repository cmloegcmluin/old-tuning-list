Actually it was more of a historical perspective- here it is again.  My
apologies if it's a repeat for some people.  I studied composition and
computer music at Illinois from 1984-1986.

One composer who described his work as "experimental" and who may have been
one of the first to think of his music as such is Lejaren Hiller, author of
the "Illiac Suite" and later "HPSCHD", a collaboration with John Cage that
featured many different superimposed N tones per octave tunings.  To this
day the studios at the University of Illnois Champaign-Urbana are referred
to as the "Experimental Music Studios".  Hiller's background was in
Chemistry, and for a time he had a joint appointment there in Chemistry and
Music.  For Hiller his experiment was if he could compose a piece of music
using the computer.  Aesthetic issues about whether the music was
appreciated by the audience were sometimes considered to be outside the
bounds of the experiment.
