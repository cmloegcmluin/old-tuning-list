Subject: Re: scary micromusic

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

Neil's lament about music by a certain well-known microtonalist seem
pointlessly depressing or pointlessly strange struck a resonant chord with
me.  As with Neil, I recognize the delicate balance involved, and agree
that the way to avoid expressing depressing or weird ideas is certainly not
by having it express nothing (i.e., "noodling" as Neil calls it).

   That delicate balance comes with it another problem:  Everybody's
balance scales come prebiased one way or another.  Some people will find
depressing what others will find to be minimally challenging.

   In analogy to semirecent news stories, I found the Lorena Bobbit story
unnewsworthy.  For something to be newsworthy, it needs not only to have
happened and happened recently, but there must also be some sort of value
in others knowing about it.  I saw none of the latter.  There are others
though who live off that sort of thing.  Perhaps they view anything short
of that as looking too much like a scene from Sesame Street or Ozzy and
Harriet.  Perhaps they're the sort of people who have "Shit Happens" bumper
stickers on their cars, to which my response has always been "well alright,
but what's the point in reminding us?"

   So taking that back to the musical realm, I personally think that
there's value in - voluntarily of course - limiting what we express in our
music.  I believe that music ideally should express something, and that
something should be challenging and intriguing, or perhaps just mindless
and fun, but expressing defeatism or depression strikes me as pointless.
Day to day life is a challenge for most of us, so singing about problems
alone says little more than the obvious that "I'm a living organism" or
"the world still isn't ideal", and rarely does more than deepen our
outrage.

   I believe that sad or painful feelings can be valuable to express
though, if there's some point of intrigue or insight to them.  For example,
a sad melody presented in the context of an unusual or surprising
underlying harmonic progression, or using a curious "twist" on traditional
forms, evokes more than just unabated pain.  The opening of Brahms' Requiem
is such a thing.  Or similarly, lyrics about how sad you are to lose a
loved one, reminiscing about the things in her life you'll miss, has a lot
more value in it than singing about the details of the blood and gore of
her death.
