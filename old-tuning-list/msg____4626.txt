Subject: Arabic Tuning

From: gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk (Graham Breed)

In a list of scales, the exact provenance of which I forget, I
found the following:

Rast       Medieval arabic scale   t  2s r  t  2s r  t
Zenkouleh  Medieval arabic scale   t  2s r  2s t  t+r
Rahawi     Medieval arabic scale   2s t  r  2s r  t  t
Hhosaini   Medieval arabic scale   2s r  t  2s r  t  t
Hhidjazi   Medieval arabic scale   2s r  t  2s t  r

These are based on the intervals

t major tone    log(9/8)
s limma         log(256/243)
r apotome t-s log(2187/2048)

On the face of it, these are all good Pythagorean scales.
However, intervals of 2s look a bit suspicious.  In fact, if you
substitute each 2s for a minor tone and each r for a semitone,
you will see that these are really much more friendly looking
scales in disguise.  Rast, in fact, looks suspiciously like a
major, and Hhosaini like a minor.

This approximation rests on the Pythagorean and syntonic commas
being nominally equal, and is very good -- to within 2 cents.
Presumably I wasn't the first to notice this, although I have
heard from two separate sources that Arabic music is based on
Pythagorean tunings, rather than a Pythagorean notation for just
tunings.  The following questions therefore arise:

1. How typical are these scales of modern and medieval Arabic
  music?

2. Are the scale definitions, which I converted from the
  frequency ratios, from a reliable, contemporaneous source?

3. How closely do observed modern tunings conform to JI?

4. Have all Arabic musicians and scholars followed this dogmatic
  Pythagorean interpretation?

I would appreciate your answers to these questions.  And, while
I'm at it, what exactly does CPS mean?

                           Graham
