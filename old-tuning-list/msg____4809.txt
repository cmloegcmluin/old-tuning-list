Vibrating strings:
The overtones of plucked strings are in general not harmonically
related. For very long, thin strings they come close, but normally the
higher partials are slightly sharper than the harmonic ratios. This is
due (mainly) to the finite bending stiffness of the string at the ends.
This is particularly noticeable in small pianos. In such pianos the
'octaves' are usually tuned a little sharp so that the first overtone
of one string does not beat with the string that is (approximately) one
octave higher. People say that the effect is smaller on grand pianos,
because the strings are much longer, but I have never done any
experiments. On the few harpsichords I have looked at, the overtones
were very close to being harmonic.

Bowed strings are quite different. The stick-slip action of the bow is
usually (very close to) periodic, and as Fourier's theorem tells you,
the components of a periodic function are harmonic. One can take a very
inharmonic string (e.g. attach a small weight to it) and then bow it
carefully and produce a spectrum whose components are as harmonic as
you can measure.

In wind instruments, the reed, the player's lips or the air-jet take
the role of the bow and produce a periodic function. So in steady state
the components of these instruments are harmonic, even though the
resonances of the instrument may not be. Ask a beginning flute player
to play two notes an octave apart, and you'll be surprised at the
interval that results. But look at or listen to the components of the
lower note, and you'll find that they are as harmonic as you can
measure.

Note the point about steady state: only a periodic wave that is of
infinite duration has exactly periodic components. In practice, most
string and wind instruments only play notes for say 10s or so, so you
cannot measure the frequencies more accurately than 0-.1 Hz. And
usually the players will add some vibrato as well. So, as in every
other branch of science, you can never say that the results accord
exactly with the theory, because you can never make measurements with
infinite accuracy.

But, to the accuracy of your ears, or of a spectrum analyser running
over a few seconds, the components of a steadily bowed string or
steadily blown wind instrument are harmonic.

Plucked strings are not harmonic, and noticeably so in  many cases such
as pianos. Percussion instruments (you mention bells) have components
that depart even further from harmonic ratios.
