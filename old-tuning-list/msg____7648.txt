   I think that those who favor a prime-based limit scheme would agree with
that, but say that you're listening for the wrong thing.

   They would agree that any arbitrary power of 2 produces an effect of
equivalence, but that equivalence is not what arbitrary powers of 3
produce.  They'd say that three produces that feeling of steely coldness we
hear in 3:2 and 4:3 (for example), and you can stack up as many threes as
you'd like without changing that effect much.

   They'd then further say that any arbitrary power of 5 produces a
sensation of sweetness, any power of 7 produces that classic septimal zap,
and so forth.  But there would not be a feeling of octave-like equivalence
between, say, 3:2 and 9:8, because equivalence is a property of powers of
2.

   Again, I personally am a bit ambilvalent on the topic, but that's what I
suspect the counterargument would be.
