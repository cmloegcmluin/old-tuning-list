Subject: Triple-Just 12-Tone Tuning System

From: "Triple Just" <triplejust@hotmail.com>

Note: I'm completely new to alternative tunings and this mailing 
list, and just arrived at this one intuitively, so I'd appreciate any 
information regarding anybody who has already discovered and/or 
elaborated this one before. Below is a copy of the post that I posted 
earlier today to 8 usenet newsgroups.

  The first person to respond told me about your mailing list, so that's 
why I'm here. Thanks.

   This tuning system is based on the super-imposition of three just 
tuning scales, the second being super-imposed on the F of the first 
scale, and the third being super-imposed on the A of the first scale. 

   This results in twelve pitch classes and twenty-two distinct 
whole-number-ratio intervals.

   For those of you with synthesizers, sound cards and/or music software 
that allows user-definable alternate tuning systems, I've provided the 
frequency settings below for an octave approximately in the middle of 
the keyboard range, which also has the minimum whole-number values for 
the frequencies of the twelve pitches. To get the frequency values for 
the higher and lower octaves, double and halve the values respectively.

   I'm going to be hosting an e-mail mailing list regarding this tuning 
system, so if you'd like to subscribe, please let me know by private 
e-mail.

   If you have a question or comment that you'd like a response to, 
please also send that by private e-mail, since I may not have time to 
follow the thread in the newsgroup. Thanks.
