     Before inventing something that is already here, you may want to look at
the Sanderson Accu-tuner or the Reyburn Cyber Tuner.  These are tuning
specific machines, though the RCT uses a powerbook.  Unlimited temperament
access, over 200 can be carried in the machine itself.  Allows all manner of
partial selection, unlimited scaling curves, accuracy to .1 cent,
etc...........
     These machines are programable to the extent that they can copy an aural
tuning on a piano, and reproduce it far closer than a second "ear tuning"
would get it.  From then on, every use of that "tuning template" allows for
further refinement, until eventually, you have a tuning that you just can't
find any way to improve.  From this standpoint of cumulative improvement, the
machine beats the ears, hands down.
