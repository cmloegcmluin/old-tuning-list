Subject: New Partch recordings promised

From: blee@dircon.co.uk (Brian Lee)

Here's a tidbit I picked up on the newsgroup
rec.music.classical.contemporary 
on the usenet and I repost it here. Please note that the discussion on
Partch he refers to is on that newsgroup not related to what's going on here.
Toodle pip!

*****************

It's great to see all this discussion about Harry Patch!  CRI has kept his
music available for more than twenty years.  He's a back bone of our
catalogue not to mention the experimental tradition in American music.

When we reissued on CD The Bewitched, we made a flyer offering both our
Patch CDs plus three books by our about Partch and the video of The
Dreamer That Remains.  If you e-mail CRI, we can send you this flyer by
standard U.S. mail.  Of the three books offered (an annotated catalogue of
his works, Genesis of a Music, and Bitter Music), Genesis is out of print
when last we checked, but the other titles can be obtained still through
CRI.  

AND, we have plans to reissue the majority of Patch's remaining Gate 5
recordings on CD.  Gate 5 was Patch's own label wherein he recorded the
majority of his major works.  Our two CDs of recordings are drawn from
Gate 5 material.  Lots still remains -- many recordings not heard in
years.  I spent a weekend last spring with Danlee Mitchell, Patch's heir,
in San Diego reviewing the material.   That's all I'll say for now... It's
going to be a lot of work to get this done (two or three new CDs) with
proper notes and librettos, etc.  So, my guess is winter/spring of next
year will be the time to look for a major new Patch series on CRI.
