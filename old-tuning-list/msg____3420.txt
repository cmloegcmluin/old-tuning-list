Western music has always had a very good "tritave" (perfect tweltfth). Even 
with a complete harmonic spectrum, the tritave adds no new frequency 
information. Why was this never perceived as an equivalence before? The 
naive answer is that all our timbres with even partials suggest octaves as 
the most direct kind of equivalence. But the fact of the matter is that we 
don't hear partials; all we hear is virtual pitches and timbres. Inharmonic 
partials are easy to hear and can form the basis of equivalence judgments. 
But octave equivalence appears to be a diffent kind of phenomenon entirely.

I doubt it. It seems to be universal, and widespread in the animal kingdom. 
People sing, and even speak, in octaves everywhere. I'm going to keep 
playing with the P-B and triple P-B scales, but I've failed to make myself 
hear tritave equivalence, not for want of trying. I've heard 7-limit 
intervals and chords as consonant, though, which motivates most of my 
microtonal exploration.
