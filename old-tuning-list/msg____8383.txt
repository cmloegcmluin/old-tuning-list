Don't let yourself be thrown by those of us who sling around a lot of
lingo--I know I'm one of the worse ones for that; I even made up some of
the terms myself.  I'm sure there are lots of list members who question
how much those highfalutin' big words have to do with making good music
anyway.

OTOH, you might make a good test case--John Chalmers and I have been
kicking around the idea of some sort of "intro to the list" document
(I don't quite dare call it an FAQ; that may be a bit too ambitious for
the amount of time anyone has for it).  Specifically, what terms and
concepts do/did you feel you need filling in on?  Reply off-list if you
like, and I'll start trying to knock something together.
