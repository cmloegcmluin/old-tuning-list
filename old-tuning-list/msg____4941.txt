Take an electric guitar.  Strum a chord, and hold the guitar
next to the amp.  A positive feedback loop will be set up
between the pickups, strings and amp.  As electric guitars aren't
designed to have resonatins sound boards, it's a fair bet the
sound is traveling through the air and into the strings.  Of
course, you have to have the amp fairly loud, and hold the
guitar pretty close.  It also works with a bass guitar, which is
acoustically unviable.

Come on, you all already knew this, didn't you?

About inharmonic timbres: does anyone have data on the
inhamonicity of a human singing voice?  In as far as music is a
natural human behaviour, it's about singing and dancing.

Now, I've finished a MIDI file parser that does most of the things
that Brian McLaren asked for in TD906.  I have lost a few digests
since, so I can't be sure someone hasn't done it already, but
mine can handle pitch bends as well, so there!  I'll ftp it to
the site associated with this list once I've written some
documenation and tested it.
