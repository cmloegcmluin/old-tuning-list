   It's good to hear that others found it enlightening as well.

   As I understand it, three manufacturers have machines that support it,
one of whom is Ensoniq.  In particular, Ensoniq's MR-series machines do, as
does the ASR-X.  I don't know the other manufacturers' machines, but I
suspect that John Loffink's web page has that information on it.
