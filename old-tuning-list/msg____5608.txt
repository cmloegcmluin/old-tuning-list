Subject: Digest 1090, 1092: Partch and dissonance

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

It's instructive to look at _Dark Brother_ as a source for Partch's
treatment of dissonance. This piece and _Even Wild Horses_ are the most
diamond oriented of his scores. In fact the score copy of DB with which Iam familar includes an added notation of a harmonic analysis in terms of
the diamond (16/9O, 11/8U etc.). However, the score includes frequent
dissonances in the form of passing tones or suspensions, and the
introduction features microtonal passagework on the chromelodeon
deliberately designed to get particular rates of beating. Partch's
conception of dissonance was early on a broad one, and included everything
from clusters and beating to more traditional uses of non-harmonic pitches.
Interestingly, on the last point, Partch appeared to have a contextual
conception of what constituted ''non-harmonic'' or ''inharmonic''. For
example, the 15 identity might be used on a slide guitar uniformly but
Partch considered it ''inharmonic'' because it was not available throughout
his ensemble, and although most listeners would probably find it more
consonant than the 11 identity.  Received: from ns.ezh.nl [137.174.112.59] by vbv40.ezh.nl
