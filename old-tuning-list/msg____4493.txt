Much as in the trombone example, you are confusing the issue of harmonic 
tones and harmonic partials. The act of touching the string to make it 
produce a harmonic will increase its tension and therefore not result in the 
same pitch as an overtone of the open string. A steadily bowed string 
exhibits a periodic waveform; therefore, the partials are harmonic.

He did indeed also state that fact, much disbelieved in his time.
