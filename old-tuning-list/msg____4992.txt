Subject: Ancient Geeks and irrationals

From: Jonathan Wild <jon@sound.music.mcgill.ca>

This is a few days late, but there was some question of how much some  
Greeks *really* minded irrational quantities... 


"Repugnance" towards irrationals was strictly limited to disciplines  
regarded as subordinate to mathematics. Look at the Greek quadrivium  
to see how music fits in:

        MATHEMATICS                    GEOMETRY
          (number)                    (magnitude)

           MUSIC                       ASTRONOMY
    (number as embodied          (magnitude as embodied
         in sound)                 in celestial motion)

The schism between the sciences dealing with the discrete vs those  
dealing with the continuous (number vs magnitude) was a huge factor  
in the development of mathematical methods. It was precisely because  
Greek geometry *could* deal with the continuous and the irrational  
that it flourished, rather than Greek mathematics, which dealt only  
with the discrete and the rational. So, for example, a proof of what  
we think of today as a simple algebraic identity like 


   (a-b)^2 (a-b)(a+b)

had to be ingeniously couched in purely geometrical terms.  Eudoxus  
(a contemporary of Plato) put forward a brilliant theory of  
irrational proportions that could have incorporated them into Greek  
mathematics, but unfortunately no-one really took him up on it till  
the late 19th century. (By the way, Plato shouldn't be mentioned in  
connection with hiding the fact that there are irrational numbers --  
somewhere he says that any man unaware of their existence is no  
better than a swine...)

I guess if Pythagoreans could have construed music as *magnitude*  
embodied in sound (i.e. subordinate to geometry) rather than *number*  
embodied in sound, there would never have been a problem with  
irrational proportions in music.  Don't jump to any conclusions and  
think that Aristoxenus favoured such a switch in music's allegiance,  
however: as mentioned already in this thread he places music  
subordinate to nothing save perception, as exemplified in his  
do-it-yourself investigation (he never called it a "proof") of  
whether the fourth contains two and a half tones, which you can find  
at the end of book II of the Elements of Harmonics. 


Anyway, despite Greek geometry's perfectly adequate treatment of  
irrational proportions, repugnance towards them in areas where  
*number* was thought to matter was very real, and is evidenced in  
many writings dealing with "mathematical" disciplines. One fantastic  
example, mentioned by Aristides Quintilianus and also found in the  
Hippocratic *Endemics*, tells physicians that diseases whose symptoms  
appear in "concordant" ratios (like one day for every two they are  
absent) are not dangerous, while those whose symptoms appear in  
irrational or continuous proportions are "deadly, and to be feared".  
Heck, even Aristotle thought that pleasant colours resulted from  
elementary particles of black and white mixed in simple ratios,  
whereas irrational proportions gave rise to unpleasant colours (this  
is somewhere in *De Sensu*). And as far as musical thinking goes,  
here's Barker's translation of Adrastus:

      Under irrational relations noises are irrational
      and unmelodic, and should not strictly even be called
      notes, but only sounds; but under relations that place
      them in certain relations to one another, they are
      [...] strictly and properly notes.
