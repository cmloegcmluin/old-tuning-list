Subject: Iggy Pop and the One-Footed Bride

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Yesterday, I mentioned:

And Gary Morrison asked:

First off, if Gary could follow my train of thought, he's doing better than
me! What I meant was that any kind of 'sea change' that would lead to the
widespread adoption of non-12tet in a large pop idiom would have to occur
over a very long time, and could probably only occur with concurrent
changes in culture, etc.

The other point I wanted to make, but my train of thought left me at the
station, was that we must be careful to not carry too much of a Western or
Euro-centric view on all of this. While the bulk of the consumers may be in
the developed 'Western' world, I have heard pop bands in Madagascar that
have stretched things, mostly owing to offshoots of vocal music.
Additionally, aren't there quite a few popular artists in the arabic world
utilizing non-12tet instruments (along with obviously non12 vocals)? Not an
area of expertise for me, but I was under that impression.

Just seems to me we (those of us here) are in a pretty subtle niche. Now,
back to my Spring 1997 issue of 1/1, which just (no pun intended) arrived
today.

Or was it arrived just today...

Cheers,
Jon

BTW, I won't waste bandwidth here, but a dear musician friend sent me a
hilarious posting on "How To Sing The Blues" -- if you want an email of it,
let me know off-list.
