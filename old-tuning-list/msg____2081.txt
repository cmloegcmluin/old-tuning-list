Subject: Quantum Mechanical Psychoacoustics

From: MMCK@delphi.com

The following message verges on science fiction, but I just can't
help myself.

A few days ago, I read an article in the October, 1995 Scientific
American called "Quantum-Mechanical Computers" by Seth Lloyd. 
The author describes the construction of a quantum mechanical
computer which makes use of the Heisenburg uncertainty principle
to solve difficult problems in combinatorial mathematics--a super
fast factoring algorithm, for example.  The quantum computer
would use particle energy state/positions to encode information. 
I can't pretend to understand all the details yet, but if this
really works is could be the scientific breakthrough of the
century, IMHO.

A day or so later I read Brian's post on psychoacoustics, and was
struck by the idea that the brain might be a quantum mechanical
computer.  This would explain many anomalies about how such an
apparently slow system could consistently outperform silicon
which seemingly operates hundreds or thousands of times faster. 
It could also mean that far from a simple on/off coding for each
neuron, that each exchange of an ion between two neurons could
encode a multibit packet of information.

If you've read this far, remember that I tried to warn you.
