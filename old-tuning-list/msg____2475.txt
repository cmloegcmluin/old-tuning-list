The notation seemed to imply it. When
you give only a "number of steps in an
octave" and the number of steps between
consecutive notes in the scale [as
2 2 1 2 2 2 1 for a standard major
scale] you have something well-defined
only in ET.

All the scales that are based on ration-
al frequency ratios need such a chart
in addition to the list you provide in
order to be useful.

I suppose that what I'm looking for is
something that would enable me to re-
liably reproduce any scale that has a
name. Your chart, for equal-tempered
scales, does that (for the ones you
provide, but obviously any you've
missed can be added). But for non-equal
scales, it still misses the one thing
that makes it useful to my purpose, the
precise ratios that the 12, or 14, or
however many, steps are supposed to
mean.

I like your format, and I'd like a
table such as yours to serve as a base
for what I'm trying to do.
