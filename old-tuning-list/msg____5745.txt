This is a twofold misunderstanding. The tradition is muddy enough, but
evidently Pythagoras (or better: the Pythagoreans) was (were) not workingwith a conscious ''limit'' of three, but with the hypothesis that the
numbers 1 and 2 alone yielded musically insufficient materials, and that
the addition of some number of factors of 3 would yield the rational
resources to construct the known scales. This is subtly but vitally
different from the notion of _limit_.

Although an obvious enough concept, the term _limit_ appears to be Partch's
innovation in musical terminology. His late romantic harmonic view was
based upon a ''stacked thirds'' model, frequently found in American theory
texts of the time, and used by Partch in terms of odd, not prime chordal
components. (Interestingly, Partch's viewpoint leads - to my ears - to a
better explaination of the lowered ninth (as the 17th) than the
conventional treatment as an ''altered tone''.) In view of Partch's
priority and importance, I think it is due respect to use ''limit'' as
''odd limit'' and explicitly say ''prime limit'' when that is the case.

The leading alternative to the limit classification is that of Euler, which
lists the set of generative factors. This has the advantage in that factors
left out in a given system that would otherwise be implied by a limit
labeling are not falsely incorporated. (Example: Sometimes I use the
Eikosany with (1,3,7,9,11,15) as factors in preference to (1,3,5,7,9,11);a
limit notation would not make the distinction clear).

This discussed really repeats a discussion from last fall (and probably
from earlier than that!). Are the archives to the list available and
indexed in such a way that we can easily direct new members to earlier
