Subject: Re: A response to Mr. Johnny Reinhard

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Further, following Jon Szanto's responses, when one directs the American 
Festival of Microtonal Music, one is obligated to include music by Harry 
Partch.  To this end, the AFMM presented Danlee Mitchell intoning Li Po 
with Doug Laurent in 1984, as well as as the 2 Studies on Ancient Greek 
Scales by Dean Drummond and Stefani Starin.  (If I'm disappointed by the 
unfair playing field, it should be understandable to the fair minded.)

When I performed the 2 Studies for guitar and bassoon the New York Times 
said:  "His "Two Studies on Ancient Greek Scales," played here by Mr. 
Reinhard and Mr. Catler, occupied a beautifully colored, static, almost 
incantatory world."  When I sent the tape to Mr. Mitchell, he wrote that 
our performance was ghastly..."a mixture of elephants and giraffes at a 
watering hole."

The Partch music that the AFMM Ensemble performs is the material that 
either had never been played before, or not in NYC for decades.  This 
includes: "Ulysees Departs" in the original version with boobams, trumpet 
and double bass, Version 2 of US Highball and Barstow, December 1942, Li 
Po, Dark Brother, Yankee Doodle Fantasy.  Bach's 2 part works are 
masterworks, why not Partch?

Like any listener, I was reacting to my experiences.  I missed the 
non-corporeal performance in Lincoln Center of Revelation, but I saw the 
full production in Philadelphia.  The instruments were hidden behind the 
action, they didn't move, and they were poorly amplified.  Dean Drummmond 
has greatly improved the Partch experiences I have had since listening in 
the NYC area, and gradually so as might be expected.

Exactly, I invite you to see, feel and experience our AFMM Ensemble 
performances of Partch's music, perhaps when we tour through California 
during the MIcrotonalLENNIUM.

Jon and I are corresponding separately.  I have great respect for his 
playing skills having heard him in San Diego, though he didn't remember.  
Is Yo-Yo Ma a selfish SOB...I wouldn't know.  I hope there is no 
inference here about "troublesomeness."  I mentioned difficulty with the 
Ives Society because there is always difficulties, or almost always, with 
the inheritors of composers - often in the form of socities (e.g. Varese, 
Wyschnegradsky, Sandberg, Ives, etc.)  The difficutly I had with the Ives 
Society was that they did not believe that anyone on the outside could 
finish sections B and C of what turned out to be a 74 minute work.  
Thankfully, their resident musicolgoist found the score admirable and 
there were no other difficulties.  Please don't read into my comments any 
deeper than I've explained.

Jon Catler's 13-limit stratocaster is better than Parch could hope for.  
Please note that Partch discontinued useage of the guitar in his later 
music.  Listen to Jon play US Highball version 2 and you feel the train, 
as with Joshua Pierce performing on the synthesized chromolodeon.  
Partch's guitars were poor instruments.  No need to romanticize them.

>   "Drummond's hoarding of the instruments"

I asked to fix broken instruments, not to borrow a Stradivarious.  Dean 
told me by telephone "You couldn't afford to rent them."


>   "monopoly on his instruments"

I think this is increasingly clear.


>   "territoriality and protectionism"

These terms apply to many who feel they hold something of value and want 
to retain the power of its use.  It is a natural human tendency, if 
unfortunate.
   
I think it necessary to speak out on this issue because it is in the 
news, notably the British Harry Partch Newsletter.  Look to their review 
of our Swiss radio broadcast in a coming issue.  I look to the British to 
have a fair perspective.  Remember, in this country Charles Ives is still 
an "amateur" and Harry Partch, well you know.
