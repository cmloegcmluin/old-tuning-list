Interestingly, 11/8 is the _only_ ratio of 11 that Patrick Ozzard-Low
considers a primary consonant interval in his recent giant paper. But
the main reference on 11 is Partch, who considered all ratios of odd
numbers up to 11, plus octave inversions and extensions of these
intervals, consonant. Partch's music can be said to conform to the
11-limit under both definitions of the term "limit": the odd limit is 11
because all ratios involving odd numbers higher than 11 (including 15/8)
are considered dissonant by Partch, and the prime limit is 11 because
even the dissonant intervals are ratios of numbers with no prime factors
above 11.

Personally, I find 11-limit intervals hard to digest unless they are
combind into an otonal chord like 4:5:6:7:9:11. I can even sing the 11
over a 4:5:6 major triad. However, Utonal 11-limit harmony always sounds
dissonant to me, despite Partch and Johnston's theories.
