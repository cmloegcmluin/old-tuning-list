   I for one agree.  Limits can often be desirable.  Other phraseologies
I've used:  
* It's hard to produce a music that really stretchs the limits if you don't

  afford yourself any limits in the first place.
* Walls limit your movement, but they also give you a place to hang
pictures.
* Doing clever things with limited resources impresses people.  It's hard
to 
  pinpoint cleverness in an effort made on infinite resources.  
* It's certainly true that you need muscles to move, but even with the
  strongest muscles you won't get anywhere without a skeletal framework for
  those muscles to act upon.
