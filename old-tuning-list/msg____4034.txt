   (Why do you hesitate to contribute?)

   The fact that such a thing would, as you astutely pointed out, allow you to
change the key layout as easily as changing a computer-generated image.  Two
potential challenges come to mind though.

   First, computer screens are nearly square as opposed to the extremely long
and narrow, horizontal format of most any keyboard scheme.  Can we come up with
key layouts that make sense on a nearly-square format?

   I have thought of another type of controller than a keyboard (it would
probably be too difficult to describe in words) but it does have one problem in
common with this sort of thing:  It would be kinda tough to make velocity
sensitivity detectable.
