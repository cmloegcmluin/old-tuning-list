The minor pentatonic scale is MOS and strictly proper, but other
Japanese scales are among the most important examples of scales that are
not MOS, proper, or distributionally even (John Clough's term for a
scale with two step sizes and no more than two specific sizes for each
generic interval). Other important examples are the jazz (ascending)
melodic minor scale and the various scales containing augmented seconds.
