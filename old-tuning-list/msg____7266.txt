Subject: RE: EPS 16+ vs. ASR-X

From: "Loffink, John" <John.Loffink@COMPAQ.com>

I have extensive hands-on experience with the EPS and EPS 16-Plus but not
the ASR-X.  I will attempt to answer your questions based on the information
I've gathered for my "Microtonal Synthesis" web site.

You are correct that the ASR-X supports only one global tuning table at a
time.  It's architecture in this regard is based more on the MR-Rack, so I
doubt your pitch tables from the EPS 16-Plus are transferrable.  Pitch
resolution should be the same or better as the 16-Plus.

I don't know of any computer program (MIDI patch/program editor) that
supports the MIDI tuning standard other than Justonic's Pitch Pallette, and
it supports only 12 note per octave scales.  Anyone?

The ASR-X can load EPS/EPS 16-Plus/ASR-10 samples and programs as well as
AIFF and WAV files, Akai S1000 type sample files and others.
