That's one way of looking at it, of course, but not the way
I look at it.  Firstly, there's no real distinction between
horizontal and vertical.  Harmony is as much about putting
chords together as describing their properties in isolation.

I prefer to have a repeating chord sequence, and choose the
melodic notes to harmonise with that.  As the harmony is
chosen with lattice space in mind, that means a lot of the
same notes will work with each chord.  So, there's some kind
of modality.  This is very different from choosing a mode
first, and trying to get chord sequences from it, even if
the result is the same.  If you structure a melody around,
say, a pentatonic mode with a load of chromatic notes, it
should sound cohesive enough.

I sort of know what I'm talking about here, because I have
written music like this.  My previous post on avoiding
comma shifts is completely wrong in detail, though.  You
never need have a 1/5 from the tonic in a major key, it's
the fifths that cause trouble.  How tactful of you all not
to point that out!  To get 6 5-limit triads with distinct
roots from 7 notes, they have to be a cycle of fifths, and
therefore a diatonic key.  So, as all the fifths are in tune,
you need some kind of compromise for the thirds to be also.
If you ignore the supertonic chord (ii) in a major key,
there's no problem with JI.  If you do use the supertonic,
provided you go straight back to the chord you came from,
there's still no problem, but you need 8 notes.
