A MIDI note on message is 20 bits at 31250 Kbaud, so the best case timing
between each consecutive note on the same MIDI cable is 640 us.  Actual
results would be much worse due to processing time by your sequencer and
especially your MIDI synthesizer.  Keyboard's MIDI Timing Slop tests in the
July 1996 issue showed average timing irregularities of 0.29 to 1.95 ms for
a single MIDI note and 0.30 to 3.36 ms for 1 voice alternating with 12
voices, except the Roland XP-10 which showed 19.14 ms of timing variation. 
Instruments tested included some of the common microtonal ones:  Ensoniq
MR-Rack, Korg M1 and Trinity, Kurzweil K2500RS, Roland XP-50 and Yamaha
TX802.

I wouldn't recommend MIDI for anyone needing Rayna/Kyma/CSOUND type
resolution.
