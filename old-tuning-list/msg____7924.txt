Subject: root moving

From: BUYO-BUYO-IGOR <igor@db3.so-net.ne.jp>

thanx Mr. Nowitzky for your interest.

since i usually play bass....i didn't like the idea that the root staying at
 the same place..
what i'm trying to do is to give a freedom to root by handling 233.609hz as 
a common harmonics...
the music doesn't have to have 233.609 existing all the time and when improvising
 to the prepared dat thang .... players can even go away from this harmonic 
structure...
but we will say "this music has hidden 233.609 as its gravity"...too musch harmolodic
? 

so if using your tablet from..it would be like this...i think..

i checked the calculation ...and oh my buddha!!
241.145 was the 16/31 of 233.609...it had to be 249.183(8/15)...

        Freq    Name          Times "root"
        ------- ----    -------------------------
        233.609 root            1/1   233.609
        233.609 9th             9/8   207.652
        233.609 13th         13/8   287.519
        233.609 5th             3/2    155.739
        233.609 M7           15/8    249.183
        233.609 3rd             5/4    186.887
