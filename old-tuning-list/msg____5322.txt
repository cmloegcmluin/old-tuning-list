   That one of the hardest problems in IQ testing of signing apes, like the
lowland gorilla Ko-Ko, is that it's hard to explain to them that their task
is to answer the questions as quickly and accurately as possible, so that
they'll get as high as score as they're capable.  Most of the time, they
just take it as another fun little game, and use it as another opportunity
to joke and play with the psychologist.

   It's not totally impossible that part of the reason why Mozart's music
could have this effect, is that it puts subjects into a mood appropriate
for IQ testing - calm and inquisitive in part.  Stockhausen, or in a
different way, Ted Nugent, might have a different effect.
