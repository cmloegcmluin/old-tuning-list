     Oddly enough,  I have found that ET is the most perishable tuning on a
piano, and I don't know why. Perhaps it is that ET is already so "out of tune"
that changes are quite evident, whereas on a well temperament, all the keys
are different anyway,so the change in tuning is only a change in degree.  On
equal temperament, a shift in the tuning destroys the only unique thing that
ET has. 
    Perception aside,  well temperaments and meantone tunings on modern pianos
are more stable than ET, after the initial string alterations are relaxed.

    Yes, I have read Fletcher, but it doesn't explain why the inharmonicity of
a piano wire measures higher as the tension is increased.  Perhaps there is a
point of reversal, inre tension/inharmonicity.
