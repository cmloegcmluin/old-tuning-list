I would be very surprised to find any historic works that specified a
particular tuning--such exactitude is a very modern sensibility.  I
mean, when the original temperament wars were going on (the Baroque)
we're talking about a time when composers often didn't care if you used
a flute or a violin to play the top part in a sonata!  Plus, choosing an
appropriate tuning would have been (in most cases rightly) assumed to be
something the performer was easily capable of, and thus entirely
unnecessary for the composer.
