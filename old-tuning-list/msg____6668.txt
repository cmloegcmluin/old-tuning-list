The failure of 22-tone equal to provide both consonant thirds and fifths
has nothing to do with diatonicism; the presence of consonant melody and
harmony is no less vital for the use of chromatic modes than for the use
of diatonic ones; I assume you will agree if you consider the matter. If
anything, because chromatic modes have but four (at most), not six
degrees (as in the diatonic modes) on which consonant triads are
erigible, chromatic modes in 22-tone equal would be even more
disorganized than diatonic ones. For enharmonic modes the matter is less
clear-cut, I concede.
