Subject: Conflict

From: hyperpoodle@mail.sisna.com (Doren Garcia)

The ensuing conflict among our microtonal brothers is fair measure of the
extreme passions involved. I, for one, am somewhat amused by it, as I see
value of all the participants.

However, before we choose up sides we should contemplate the "product"
pumped out by Hollywood and a world filled with status quo stagnation.
