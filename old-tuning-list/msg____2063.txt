Subject: Re: Automated applications of Just Intonation

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

Here are some other possible automated or semiautomated just intonation
schemes Lars, or others on the list, might want to look into:  

   You might want to report on Wendy Carlos' method of retuning on the fly by
using a separate one-octave keyboard that plays nothing but tells what key-frame
in which to interpret the pitches of the keys on the main keyboard that does
play notes.  

   I don't know where such documentation exists (perhaps John Chalmers knows of
some), but you could perhaps also report on Ivor Darreg's justifying organ from
.. the mid sixties I think it was.
