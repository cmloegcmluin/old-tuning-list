Subject: Re: A useful new page

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I have just added a link to John Loffink's page. In his words, the 
content of:

The Microtonal Synthesis Home Page 

     A listing of all synthesizers, samplers, sound cards and software 
synthesizers capable of user programmable microtonal
     scales or tunings: just intonation, non-12 equal tempered, 
well-tempered scales, xenharmonics, etc. Information on types
     and number of scales is also given. Samples of microtonal music 
using modern electronic instruments can be found by
     checking out the artists in Recommended Listening 

It seems quite useful, and the recommended listening could become a 
valuable resource.

John Loffink's page is at
http://www.homefree.net/cgi-shl/dbml.exe?templateomefree/view.dbm&pageidy72


Later, gang.
