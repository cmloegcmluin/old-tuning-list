A good reference for ancient shruti and raga stuff is

Rowell, Lewis. 1992. Music and Musical Thought in Early India. University of 
Chicago Press.

The modes and alterations thereof described here lead to various scales with 
steps of 4, 3, and 2 shruti. The "just" interpretation of the shruti scale 
makes these intervals unequivocally 9/8, 10/9, and 16/15, respectively. The 
22 shruti have often been interpreted as 22-tet. Using 12-tet works better 
than 22-tet for these modes, though, since the difference between the 4- and 
3- shruti steps is large enough to disturb the melodic beauty of the scales 
in 22-tet (as Rowell points out). However, interpolating chromatic notes 
into these modes so that the three 4-shruti intervals become 2+2 in 22-tet 
leads to melodically satisfying 10-note scales that can form the basis for 
7-limit harmony and tonality. (See my upcoming paper in Xenharmonikon 17). 
Two of these three interpolations indeed correspond to the two recognized 
altered notes of ancient Indian music theory.
