Subject: hearing RF

From: "kris peck" <kpeck@wavetech.net>

I hesitate to contribute to these somewhat off-topic discussions, but I
thought people would be interested in something I found at work regarding
hearing electromagnetic signals.

"Another RF biological effect that has received attention is the so-called
microwave 'hearing' effect.  Under certain specific conditions of
frequency, signal modulation, and intensity, it has been shown that animals
and humans can perceive an RF signal as a buzzing or clicking sound. 
Although a number of theories have been advanced to explain this effect,
the most widely-accepted hypothesis is that the microwave signal produces
thermoelastic pressure within the head that is perceived as sound by the
auditory apparatus within the ear.  It is important to emphasize that the
conditions under which this effect occurs would not normally be encountered
by members of the general public."

--"Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of
Radiofrequency Radiation", OET Bulletin #56, January 1989, Federal
Communications Commission Office of Engineering and Technology


Personally, I don't think I want to spend too much time aiming microwave
signals into my head to investigate this phenonemon.
