Paul: I was referring to the Minkowski "Taxicab" "City Block," or 
"Manhattan" metric where the distance function is ds|dx| +|dy| +|dz|...
rather than the square root of the sum of the squares of the Euclidean
or relativistic metrics. Thus 6/5, 5/3, 16/15 and 15/8 would have
the same distance from 1/1 as you point out.  

As for "punning," one may map the relevant region of the tonal 
lattice onto (or do I mean into?) some ET by using Fokker's 
application of the cross and/or box products after choosing the 
intervals (kommata) one wishes to set to zero. I  think  his papers 
on "Periodicity Blocks" are in the Bibliography. 

Whether one should use a pseudo-Cartesian (right angle) lattice
or a polygonal/polyhedral one is for me mostly a matter of taste.
At Paul E's earlier suggestion, I started plotting 7 and higher
limit scales on oblique, polygonal lattices (the simpler ones are
easily interpretable as polyhedrons in 3 space). I must admit that 
I got  stunning graphics, though beyond about the 11-limit, I find 
the rectilinear mode easier to interpret.
 
However, I got fascinated by the patterns, so, I wrote a series of
Q&D Basic programs to plot scales (after factoring their ratios) on a 
series of polygonal lattices of the type Erv Wilson has used. I stopped 
at the centered-tridekagon and the 43-limit. I recommend this 
approach to those of you with faster computers, more memory, and higher 
resolution graphics than I have. 

I might mention the Carter Scholz's latest version of JiCalc plots
scales on a 31-limit lattice (pseudo-Cartesian). It's downloadable
from Mills. Also, it plays each lattice point when the note 
is clicked.
