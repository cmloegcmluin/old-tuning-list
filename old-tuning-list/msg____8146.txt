Subject: Scala/Jicalc

From: Greg Schiemer <gregs@mail.usyd.edu.au>

I've recently tried to run Scala on a Mac using Virtual PC -- without
success. Has anyone succeeded in doing this ? I've been allowed to run an
elective on alternate tunings but am limited by the fact that I only have
access to a Mac lab. I've seen Jicalc but Scala seems more suitable for
working with Csound and it has an amazing scales archive. Is there any way
of accessing the scales archive from Jicalc ?  Does JiCalc have script
files (equivalent of .CMD files in Scala) ?
