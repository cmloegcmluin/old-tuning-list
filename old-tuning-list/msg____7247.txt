Subject: Harry Partch Instrument crisis

From: rumsong@cadvision.com (Gordon Rumson)

Greetings,

This is an issue of considerable importance to the musical life of the
United States and further afield.  The musical instruments of Harry Partch
are being expelled from their current location.  Full details of the
problem, crisis indeed, is to be had at:

It is important that such an event NOT occur or that alternative
arrangements be found for housing these national treasures.

As a supporter of music of the new and little known I hope that others will
share my concern.  Should he not be widely respected and performed?

Please check out the site and send a letter to the 'powers that be' to
encourage them to alter their decision.

The Internet is not merely a forum for opinion, it is also a tool for
action.  Please do not be offended by this message and please do join in
preventing a major error of judgment.

All best wishes,

Gordon Rumson
