>You can't change patches in real-time on the samplers.

   If by that you mean that there will be a delay when you select a patch -
a delay to load it from disk - then yes, that's certainly true.  But the
ASR's designers didn't say something like "well, this is a sampler, so we
can't switch patches, therefore we won't even respond to patch-change
messages".
