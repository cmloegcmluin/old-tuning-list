I'm going off email for a few weeks in a few days (Jody and I are leaving
Melbourne on Friday, and spending a few weeks in Indonesia on the way home), so
in this list's tradition of posting things and not checking the response to them,
I thought I'd add two small thoughts (also in response to Johnny's request
for de-lurking, and I admit to being a chronic lurker)

First, after reading all the vitriolic postings and personal attacks on this
list, it occurred to me that I can't remember ever seeing a post by a woman.
I'm sure there have been (I don't read all the postings), but if so, 
they are very few, even fewer than in other male dominated musical genres (computer
music, etc.). Does this seem like a potential problem to anyone here?

Second, I do enjoy any opportunity for Eric Lyon to respond to things,
because he's always such a pleasure to read. I also don't think that a composer
and researcher like Eric needs defending, he's way above that. But... since
his name has been brought into the limelight, this is a good opportunity to say
that if people don't know his music and his software, it would be well
worth the effort. Eric is a composer of extraordinary interest, his music
is intelligent, very sophisticated, and o often very funny in a non-trivial way.
His new solo cd is beautiful (I've been listening to it a lot here in australia),
and his guitar piece "Greaseball" (beautiful recording on CRI), the two piano
piece "bonko bonzo" (on the Thump CD), "A Little Something Because You're
Special", and his computer pieces are all terriffic: insightful, unusual,
and sort of pure "eric"

Especially relevant to a lot of the DSP-oriented discussion on this list,
Eric is an important contributor to the body of widely used DSP music
software on the net. His phase vocoder and a lot of his music tools
for UNIX environments are really important. I like his work there not
only for the quality of what it does, but also because of his attitude
(which I share) about us slackademics being in a kind of priveliged position,
we can write software and give it away, and make that software both
forward looking and usable by others.

Anyway, it's always nice when personal attacks offer an opportunity to
plug someone's work who I respect as much as I do eric...

back on in january
