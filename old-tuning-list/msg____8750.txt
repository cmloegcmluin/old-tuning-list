I haven't seen these pages since I accidentally discovered this
new section of the North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island,
but consider this:

Consider using Microsoft Word 97 to create an Adobe PDF (Adobe Acrobat)
file. As a test, I took a 20k web page and it's three jpeg
files totaling a whopping 3.2 megs (scanned at 600 dpi!!!)
and created a PDF file = 88k.

Netscape treats the file likes a web page and the files
are read with the Adobe Acrobat plugin. Acrobat is
available on the net as a free download.

Stockhausen keeps his catalog and list of works on line
in this way. I've seen a couple of other web pages set up this way too.

A good solution? I think so.
