Subject: what's real?

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Haverstick here...a good discussion about the nature of the harmonic 
series, eh? Here's a quote from Danielou's book which is very interesting 
to me..."As noted by Raouf Yekta Bey, `Music, like the other mathematical 
seciences, is a science whose laws are fixed and invariable. Just as two 
and two make four in the East as well as in the West, the fundamental 
laws of music apply at all times and for all peoples.`"
    I know I'm out of my element just a bit in the math end of things, 
but the basic principles are the issue here. Forgive me if I didn't get 
it quite right, but I believe Starrett said that the Harmonic series was 
more of a mental construct than a physical reality, because nothing in 
Nature vibrates precisely at the frequencies of the Harmonic series. If 
this be the case, then what's all the fuss about "just intonation" in the 
first place? However, the above quote by Bey seems to be pointing to some 
profound issues about music, issues which I have been giving great 
thought to in the last few months. I have a feeling that there ARE exact 
mathematical correspondences in the very fabric of sound, correspondences 
of deep significance, relationships that, in the "old" days (and maybe 
even now), could be applied to healing and other forms of extra musical 
activities. It's been mentioned here before, but various texts mention 
rather "magical" occurences connected to certain musical sounds, as in 
the Book of the Hopi (by Frank Waters), when the Hopi spiritual leaders 
healed themselves of severe wounds by the beautiful sounds of their 
flutes. Danielou also mentions scales that were used for healing in the 
ancient Middle East, and don't forget the battle of Jericho, when blasts 
from trumpets made walls collapse.
    For me, this is a serious pursuit, and one which I know next to 
nothing about; but, I truly believe that there may be a lot more to music 
than we know at this time. I believe it is quite possible that we (mainly 
westerners and those influenced by our way of life) have lost a lot of 
important knowledge pertaining to the foundations of sound, and how sound 
can be used in more ways than just making music for our enjoyment or 
entertainment. I believe that the Harmonic series is real, but perhaps 
there's more to it than I know at this time. 
    If it IS true, as Bey says, that the laws of music are "fixed and 
invariable", than what are we really doing when we create temperaments 
that deviate from the purity of these laws? Do we know, or care? Do we 
even believe there is a Creator who created the Harmonic laws? Again, 
this is no joke to me, and this is a subject that I think is worthy of 
much thought and study, as it may have a direct relationship to our 
existance in this world. I also have noticed that, at least up to this 
time, this is probably the least talked about subject on this forum; or, 
anywhere else, for that matter. That is curious to me...Hstick
