Subject: 11 tET mudtone bass guitar man

From: hyperpoodle@mail.sisna.com (Doren Garcia)

Tuners,

For some reason I failed to receive issue 774. Would someone be kind enough
to send me a copy?

Is anyone entering and maintaining this list in a database?

>Beethoven and Haydn have played on this piano, which was tuned in 31 tET.
>>K"onnicke built it with instructions of the Domkapellmeister of Linz,
>Johann >Georg Roser who had ordered a similar instrument in Brussels ten
>years earlier >for Mozart. Roser had several meetings in Linz with Mozart,
>who allegedly >composed two little pieces for the instrument (according to
>the manuscript of >Roser's biography), and which were regrettably lost.

Mind-blowing! Thank you Manuel Op de Coul!
