Regarding the post about the Sala Five Improvisations- it actually is available
 on CD but very hard to find.  I saw it at Rasputin's in Berkeley but they woul
dn't sell it to me as it was not yet priced.  I asked them to price it and hold
 it for me and when I returned to get it they had sold it!!!!
