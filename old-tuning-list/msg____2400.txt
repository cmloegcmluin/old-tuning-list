CAUTION: plug follows.

My program SuperCollider which is a real time synthesis program for
PowerMacs using a Scheme-like programming language DOES support
real-time microtonality. Pitches can be specified in Hertz or
converted from floating point MIDI note numbers. i.e. 63.86 is a
5/4 above C 60. Several of the demo files use Just pitches. The demo
is available from:
