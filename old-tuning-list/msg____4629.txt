Paul, It appears my statement needs some clarification--I think that in
reality we are more in agreement than you may suspect.

My understanding of improvisation is based on the notion that starting
from some given form, a performer, on the fly, may vary tempo, melodic or
harmonic structure to create something new.  You seem to indicate here
that it is composition on the fly.  Is there something special about how
fast someone composes?  I have always felt that it is what one ends up
with that is important.

Members of a good symphony orchestra are constantly in communication with
the "music" they are performing.  Often this communion is profound and
deep, and to the extent this is accomplished, the music is unique, and
alive with subtle inflections of melodic and harmonic expression and the
audience is completely captivated and moved by the experience.  Creativity
is in the expression of a phrase or even a single note--there is no need
for more or different notes.

I'll let this pass.

May I suggest that your experience with Jimi or the Duke is in precisely
the same category as Bach and Chopin--the old masters are in the form of
staves and notes, their music so inspiring that contemporary musicians
attempt to recreate their experience to share with the world--the young
"masters" are in electronic form, no less frozen than Beethoven.  100
years from now there may still be the possibility of a live, creative and
unique experience of Beethoven's 9th-- will we still have that same old
Hendrix? 

I am equally eager to see 12ET supplanted by music which transcends in
expressiveness and communicates more deeply our human soul, for I too feel
its limitations.  But we cannot throw away its profound legacy--we need to
build on it.

Thank you for your thoughts Paul.
