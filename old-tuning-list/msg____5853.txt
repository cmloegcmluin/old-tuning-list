I don't know if anybody actually does feel that way, though I'm glad to
have Gary on my side in this. I was simply pointing out that if the
rectangular matrix (Euler-Fokker, Tenney, Rapoport) view is applied to
questions of consonance and dissonance, and octave equivalence is
assumed, the above comes out as a consequence. I know that certain
applications of Euler-Fokker theory have assumed octave equivalence, for
example using the genera as scales for compositions (I recently pointed
out that in a triangular latice, there are many structures as compact or
more compact than the E-F genera). I also know that James Tenney
examines the lattice along with a city block metric to give a measure of
harmonic complexity, but I don't know whether he assumes octave
equivalence.
