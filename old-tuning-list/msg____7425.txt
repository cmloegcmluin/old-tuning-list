Subject: Touch Tone, cont.

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

I'm sorry about the illegible tables in my post about Touch 
Tone pitches and intervals yesterday. The problem seems to be 
caused by tabs and carriage returns in text originally 
written in Word and converted to ascii for upload.
(The =09 codes are tabs, the =20 CR's.)

The CR's are a bit of a problem as word-wrapping seems erratic
without them.

I have reformatted the tables and will send them to 
anyone who requests them (or repost the message if there 
is sufficient interest). I think John Loffink's post pretty much 
covered the essentials, however.
