The point is that altering each note by less than a limen changes
the interval between the notes by more than a limen.  Tonality is
irrelevant to this motif.  In a real composition, I expect the Dbb
and Cx would be ornaments to the "real" tune.  It is an example of
the sort of trick you can play in temperaments like 31 equal.  With
sound chord progressions, you can get away with quite a lot.

I'm assuming a listener will recogise the final D as being the
same note as the first one.  The ornamental notes add colour to
the motif.  The semitone interval is, at least unconciously,
perceptible.  So, these don't sound out of tune with each other
if you play them fast enough.  As a result, the whole thing sounds
more interesting than it would in 12 or 19 equal.  If you analyse
it in terms of melodic limen, though, it is perplexing.

>Question: can you _sing_ this progression... accurately?

No.
