David,

My limited understanding of the harmonic overtone series includes the idea
that the pitches of the series develop from a "perfectly" vibrating body; 
a string or column of air, etc.  The fundamental is the frequency of the
full length of the body, the 2nd harmonic vibrates with 1 node and is
twice the frequency, 2/1; the 3rd partial has 2 nodes and is 3 times the
frequency, often expressed as 3/2, sounding 5th above the 2nd harmonic,
etc.  This "perfect" body vibrates in equal divisions, these divisions
vibrating in frequencies which define the harmonic series.  The intervals
between the pitches gets gradually smaller and I suppose ultimately any
and all intervals can be defined.  Mathematically the relationship of the
frequencies is logarithmic, but the pitches are very linear in their
creation.  It is interesting to me that 12tet has in many ways limited our
understanding of musical expression.  I play with several orchestras here
in Reno with some very talented musicians and every time I play the 7th
partial on my horn in warming up someone will look up wondering why I am
playing out of tune!
