Subject: The Reply, Part Three: Whither Harry...

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

To the good folks at "Tunings-R-Us":

I am prone to good humor, and I try to enjoy life to it's fullest.  As I start this
third installment (not counting side-trips and rebuttals), it is my hope that all of 
you recognize both light-hearted tone and serious content; that you can, all by 
yourselves, distinguish between the two; and that neither diminishes it's companion.  
It's so *hard* to be clear with just 1's and 0's.  Back to our story...

Brian McLaren isn't the only one who's comprehensionally-challenged.  In the two 
previous posts I have dealt with the general issue of arranging Partch's works for 
instruments other than those of his own devising.  The matter of the Ben Johnston 
"Barstow" arrangement for string quartet and voice is another, *much* more serious 
matter.

There have probably been many quiet, backdoor versions of Partch's works, in effect 
'trees falling in empty woods'.  As they don't reach the light of day (read: a large 
audience), it doesn't make sense to rail against them, though as a practice it should 
not be condoned.  For individuals to study the music, hopefully in furtherance of their 
*own* creative voice, OK.  But when a very high profile group such as Kronos presents 
the work, the significance is at least an order of magnitude greater.  I have respected 
Kronos in the past for honoring composers with their performances and expanding (and 
improving) the music world with their commissions.  What to think, then, when this very 
group chooses to actively go against the stated wishes of the very composer they seek 
to embrace?  If you do not believe that Partch's writings themselves document *clearly* 
his disdain for this type of a setting, then know that Partch was spoken for by both 
Danlee Mitchell and Dean Drummond, expressing their dismay and displeasure at the 
ensuing abomination.

I first realized this was happening last fall, when I saw the piece listed on a program 
Kronos was doing in L.A.  This is when Danlee drafted his statement, dated October 12, 
1995; he had tried repeatedly to contact their office prior to the concert.  I 
delivered to David Harrington both documents and a tape of Harry, which contained 
excerpts from his spoken commentaries that pertained directly to the misappropriation 
of his musical works.  Best part of the evening was that they didn't even *do* 
"Barstow", substituting the "Greek Studies" as Ben couldn't join them (as David told 
Betty Freeman backstage).  After a 4.5-hour commute to Hell-A, I still had to wait 
until a couple of weeks ago to hear for myself (the CD) their 'version'.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Let me try once again: like it or not, for better or for worse, 
Harry Partch is the sum of his parts.  Give us one part and you are not working in his 
interest, or the interest of his works; you are treating Partch as grist for the mill, 
just another damn composer to load in the hopper.  It is eminently understandable, 
though undeniably frustrating, to see so many people unable to cope with Partch ON HIS 
TERMS.  Yes, this does restrict access to the music.  Yes, it does require those who 
would seek to do justice to his work to shed their specializations: for those same 
musician's to dance, act, sing, move.  Yes, this does mean that the vast sea of 
humanity won't experience Harry Partch.  How's that for living in the real world?

A strange aspect of this saga is Ben Johnston himself; listen to what he wrote of Harry 
in 1974:

    "Harry Partch created not only musical compositions but also the instruments for 
    which they were written, the scale to which those are tuned, the theory behind the 
    design of both music and instruments, and the very circumstances for making music, 
    which he believed should not have an existence independent of poetry, drama, dance, 
    sculpture.  This is an essential aspect of corporeal art.  In a fully realized 
    Partch production there are spoken words wedded to music without the abstraction 
    typical of singing; there is a dramatic story expressed though action in a theater 
    space not excluding visible actions of performing musicians as well as those of 
    dancer-actor-singers; there is a setting which significantly includes, as 
    sculptural objects, the hand-made instruments themselves.  Music functions as part 
    of a many-faceted art-work."
    
    - Dictionary of 20th Century Music, New York: Dutton, 1974.

So.  Now *I* am comprehensionally-challenged.  Has Ben changed his thoughts?  Do his 
desire to present the works (understandable) finally outweigh respect for the wishes of 
the author-composer-creator (not understandable)?  I direct those of you interested to 
his article "The Corporealism Of Harry Partch" (Perspectives of New Music, XIII/2, 
1975); from my reading, it is clear that Ben both understood Harry's intent, and the 
*seriousness* of that intent.  Ben may have started to see his own path back then, as 
he intimates, but his understanding of Harry's bone-deep convictions seems unequivocal.

Well, did you see Harry loaning out his instruments while he was alive?  Or publishing 
plans in "Popular Mechanics", so that there could be lots of little Partch Ensembles 
everywhere?  No, when he was here it was his ball-o-wax, and he allowed control of it 
to others only as he saw fit.  I tell you, ladies and gentleman, there isn't a month 
that goes by that I don't want to jump on a plane and go back to playing with the 
group; this feeling is *not* lessened by my good fortune to have done it before -- it 
makes it doubly difficult.  But I am not placating myself with 'mock' versions, or 
crying in my beer.  Harry Partch was not, and is not, a mass-market commodity.  Even he 
only begrudgingly accepted recordings as a means of dissemination.  To those that would 
cobble together a program of 'Partch-lite' transcriptions, your disregard for Partch's 
entire reason for creating serves as prelude, commentary and postlude your performance.

Oh, yes.  Someone please put in front of me a percussion controller capable of 
withstanding the brutal pounding absolutely *crucial* to the dramatically charged 
Marimba Eroica part at the conclusion of "The Bewitched".  I thought so.....

This is Brian's judgment call.  Anybody here care to venture a guess as to what Mr. 
Partch's response might be?  Oh, I forgot: he's dead now.

> But we live in the real world.  Given real-world constraints, isn't

Yes, we do.
No, it isn't, not under those circumstances.  Not by a long shot.

Arghhh...  Your eyes are glazing over, and my fingers are tired.  I have pretty well 
finished, except for some closing thoughts, a summation, and flotsam and jetsam.  I 
imagine I'll be answering to the authorities for a while, so next time I'll wrap up.  
Thank goodness...

Yours in ecstatic and undeniable rhythmicity,
Jon
