Subject: Modulating dekanies by hexanies (was RE: Meantone, Partch)

''Hmm, sounds more like modulation in the signal-processing sense than inthe musical sense of the word.  Also, the result has, potentially, up to
sixty pitches!  Isn't that rather overwhelming, cognitively speaking?''

In fact, modulation of this sort is a primary resource in 20th century
composition. Stravinsky's tonal resources included playing the octotonic
collection against each diatonic transposition (and vice versa); Partch and
Schoenberg multiplied a set of tone by their inversion (the row box and
diamond are remarkably strange bedfellows); Boulez's ''multiplication''
technique is another species of the same.

As to the number of pitches, all of the tones of a hexany multiplied by adexany fit onto a stellate eikosany (which adds the pitches needed to fill
out all of the hexads of an eikosany). Wilson has done some impressive work
with the 70 tone, 4(8 ''Hebdomekontany'', including construction of a
metallophone with all pitches; using similar kinds of transposition, I find
it easy the tonal relationships easy hear, if difficult to play. Of course,
any of these might be mapped onto closed temperaments...  As to the cognitive digestibility of such transpositions, it is entirely a
compositional problem - to compose in such a way that the tonal
relationships are projected audibly. I would venture that it is easier with
a dekany and a hexany based on simple harmonic ratios than with any
non-trivial 12 tone row.
