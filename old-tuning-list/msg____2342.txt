   Mr. Gullibility here found Adam's message a little confusing.  But anyway I
figured I'd mention for the benefit of whoever may be planning on unsubscribing
in the future, there are TWO errors in this message.  Obviously the "PLEASE"
doesn't mean much to the computer, but also (if I recall correctly) address to
unsubscribe also should not be there.  And as Adam pointed out, it should be
sent to listproc@eartha.mills.edu.
