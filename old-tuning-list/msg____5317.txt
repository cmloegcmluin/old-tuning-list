Subject: Steiner

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Steiner broke from the Theosophy movement following Annie Besant's
deification of Jiddu Krishnamurti, a young Hindu boy more or less
kidnapped from his parents by Besant and Leadbetter. In his maturity,
Krishnamurti denied he was a deity, but did set up a headquarters
in Ojai, California, a town in a valley near Santa Barbara, California.
Ojai (pronounced Oh-HI) seems to be inhabited primarily by occultists
and chiropractors, including my sister.

Besant, I might add, was an amazing person. She was a founder of
the Indian Congress Party, an early feminist, a friend of George
Bernard Shaw, etc.

According to a Theosophical book catalogue, a woman named Annie von
Lange introduced Steiner to JI. Brian Lee and I have been researching
the connections between Steiner's Anthroposophy movement and Kathleen
Schlesinger's friend and collaborator Elsie Hamilton. While we have
located some of Hamilton's scores (in KS's diatonic harmoniai),
we have not been able to find the ones mentioned and excerpted
in "The Greek Aulos."
