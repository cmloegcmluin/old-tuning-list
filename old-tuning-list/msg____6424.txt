From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

While extra keys can add new microtonal combinations, they in themselves
get in the way of fluent playing.  Yes, this is a challenge on the
bassoon.  If the instrument can already play microtonally (like the
bassoon) it wouldn't help, but hinder its fluid playing to be anymore like
the Batman's auxillary belt.

I believe there should be enough evidence in Prague for the quartertone
clarinets that the Czechs use for their annual performances of Haba's
_Matka_.  I've know many clarinetists that have mastered various tunings,
though each focuses on different intonational terrain.

The oboe does not have much room for extra keys and extra keys will make
instruments much heavier, besides.  There is a fellow in California that
developed "Fenchaphones" which are like soprano saxophones (with their
respective sizes) that had shiftable tone holes.  Washers on the tone
holes could be manipulated to slide in set grooves allowing different
tunings, including 19ET, and others.

I guess the exploration of the standard instruments needs to be through
before I would recommend changing their physical form.  Each offers so
much more than present consciousness allows.
