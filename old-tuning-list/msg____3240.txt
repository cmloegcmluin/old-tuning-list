Review of impromptu Brink Mcgoogy performance.

Friday, 12 July 1996.

After a long day registering for class at UCLA, I dropped into 'Spanish
Kitchen' art gallery in the heart of the Emerald City (LA). I was pretty
beat and was attending the opening out of loyalty to some friends.
Wandering into the back I noticed a couple of musicians getting ready. To
my surprise (and later delight) I realized the guitar maniac was... Brink
Mcgoogy! Brink, ensconced in shades, a mop wig, boxer underwear and train
boots, was, as always, sartorially splendiferous!

Apparently the gig was a spur of the moment thing, but no matter, Euterpe
seated above on the ledge above smiled downward. Everyone agreed it was a
great (though truncated) performance. Somewhere beyond surf music, filtered
through Eugene Chadbourne, Brink was as one with his guitar synth & guitar,
proving that the muse cannot be summoned, only coaxed.

Regrettably I cannot report technical info on the tuning system used other
that to guess that the tuning and timbre were (by way of the synth) in a
state of constant flux.
