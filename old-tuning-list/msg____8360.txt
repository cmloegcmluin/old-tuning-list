Subject: Trey Gunn gives tuning list a thumbs up

From: "Kris Peck" <kpeck@wavetech.net>

Hey list,
I noticed a mention of the tuning list the other day in an interview with
touch guitarist Trey Gunn (Chapman Stick, Warr Guitar), probably best known
for being a member of King Crimson.  During the interview he happens to
compare the general quality of the Crimson discussion list with that of our
own tuning list.  I'm sure the Crimson/Fripp fans on the list will find
this especially interesting.  (I also noticed Mr. Gunn includes a link to
the JI Network on his web page.)

The complete interview can be found at:

(excerpt)
..As far as mailing lists like Elephant Talk, the thing about them is
theres no standard of operating. Theres no qualifcation for entry. Anyone
can say anything, and they can use a fake name to do ittheres no
accountability. ... Theres always the hope for us that the standard could
be raised [on Elephant Talk] so that some real dialogue can take place. On
the other hand, I subscribed to a mailing list for people who do microtonal
tunings, and the level of discussion there was infinitely more accountable
and interesting than anything Ive read on Elephant Talk.

Is Trey Gunn still on the list?  I would be extremely curious to know if he
has done any microtonal guitar work!  Likewise for anyone else in the
Crimson/Fripp/Guitar Craft circle...
