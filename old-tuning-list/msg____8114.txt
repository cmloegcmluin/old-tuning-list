Gonna be one Digest/day late with my $0.02.
BTW, whopper of a Digest, we're cooking now ;-)

Just the stated specs, "256 steps per semitone resolution".

Ooh dear, Mac Speech Engine ,huh ?
Wonder what they mean by this :

Do you mean it spits out voices similar to the Speech ones that are in 
System 8 
( Victoria,Fred,etc) ?

Oh,yes PLEASE.Soon,soon.

I'm more interested in this type of thing  as a compositional tool,rather 
than
for putting on a CD.Although ,I'd like to use humanly impossible vocal 
timbres
and ranges  using synthesis.

And,I'm for quick fixes where possible.I don't have the patience,time,or 
inclination
to spend a week programing FOF filter thingies in Csound (or anything 
else) for 
5 minutes of  "vocal sounds". I 
want to write music and have real-time interaction with whatever device 
is 
making the sounds. Actually ,software synths and I don't get along very 
well in general.

I said that because of the impossibility (but,maybe some sophisticated 
DSP system,maybe like 
that in Digital Performer can make it possible) of tuning any individual 
sample
at a given pitch through the entire MIDI 128 note range and still have a 
useable sound.
I could be wrong or missing something here.
