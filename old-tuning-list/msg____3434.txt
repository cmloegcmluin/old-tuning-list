Subject: One last dance in 31/16...

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

To the Tuning List:

I make post this publicly because my attempt at private correspondence with
Johnny Reinhard, in an effort to clarify issues (and thereby make for a more
meaningful public discussion) has been ignored.  Johnny has responded to my
last posting with writing that includes factual errors and what, at face
value, seem to be personal attacks.  It was certainly my desire to *not* see
the discussion be reduced to this level; I suppose my tendency to humor in
my posts may have been misread as personal comments, though certainly not
intended.  To gain a clear understanding, and to assure Johnny of my intent
to understand his points, and allow him to correctly gauge my demeanor, if
you will, I sent him this email on 8/7:

----------
Johnny,

After a few days thought, I replied to most of your last post to the tuning
list.  Included in the reply was that I didn't want to comment on one of
your points for fear of misconstruing your actual intent.  The paragraph in
question is as follows:

>The truth is that their is a morbid qualtiy to Mr. Partch and what might 
>now be called his Bi-Polar personality.  The instruments were treated as 
>having mortality like humans.  The cloud chamber bowls have no calculable 
>way to be replaced, and the rubber bands examples of holding the 
>corporeal body of the instrument together.

Would you be kind enough to email me a little broader exposition on this
thought?  I am unclear as to the connection between the "morbidity" and the
Bi-Polar personality, and exactly what you mean by bi-polar.  And how does
the first sentence relate to the last two.  I think I have a feel for what
you are getting at, but it seemed hazy to me and I don't want to mistake
what I *think* you are saying for what you *actually are* saying.

Thanks.  Hope the teaching stuff went well!

Cheers,
Jon

It was very discouraging to find Johnny's response in the public forum.  I
assume he either felt a reply to me was unwarranted or could not be bothered
with such details. 

As I have said, there are actual errors in his post, which I will address.
I want there to be time for Johnny to respond to the above, in terms of
clarification, so I will not post my response until I hear from him or until
it becomes apparent that he is not interested in replying.

I will eliminate any sense of humor from my response.  This is not an easy
thing for me to do, but the disappointing path this debate has taken has
taken a lot of the lightness out anyhow.  Nearly everyone in this forum who
has corresponded with me has had no problem separating the humorous asides
from the serious comments.  Not everyone, though.  My fault, I guess.

See you all soon...
Jon
