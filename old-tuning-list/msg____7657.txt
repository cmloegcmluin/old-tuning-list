Being an E-mu owner, I'd say "yes with limitations". 

The module I have (Classic Keys, part of the Proteus series, I
believe) does have a user definable tuning table, and it can
be used to tune individual MIDI notes arbitrarily.  

The limitation?  It uses 768TET.  Courtesy of the highly enlightening
discussion that was/is going on, I know now why this is less than
ideal.  As a practical matter, when I tuned up 22TET on the thing, I
had some errors to distribute equitably around the octave, some of
which are as much as .7 cents (1/2 of a tuning unit).  It's good
enough for my purposes, but I suspect that others would find it
otherwise.
