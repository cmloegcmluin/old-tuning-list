Subject: The Wing'd Academy

From: gtaylor@heurikon.com (One Cointreau, on ice....)

I've been seeing this reference to Cage's comments on microtonalism being "just
another wing on the academy" for long enough to begin wondering precisely what
John might have meant. I wonder - do any of you have a source for this comment?
I'd like to take a look at the remark in its original context.

with regards,
Gregory

By the way, isn't the original quote about art resembling nature (like the quote
about the purpose of art being "to quiet the mind and render it susceptible to
divine influences") *also* a paraphrase of the Indian aesthetician Coomaraswamy?
One might also keep in mind that those epistemic traditions which see the
natural
world as physical manifestations of forms of thought or principles of action and
movement which reveal themselves to those to take the physical as "the stuff of
contemplation" might mean something very different when using using a
phrase like
"to resemble nature in her mode and method of operation" than you or I
might mean.

K'un/K'un, y'all*
Gregory

*from the book of changes (Earth o'er Earth)
The Receptive brings about sublime success,
Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
He goes astray;
But if he follows, he finds guidance.

_
I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
Powers, "Galatea 2.2"] Gregory Taylor/Heurikon Corporation/Madison, WI
