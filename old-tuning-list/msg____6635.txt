I've lamented before on this list the (apparent?) absence of primary
sources on Indian music in English.  I won't reproduce the quote,
but suffice to say it doesn't convince _me_ that Sarngadeva was
using equal temperament.  This is all irrelevant to contemporary
music, of course.  I'll bet there are more recent theorists than
Sarngadeva who imply that 1/4 comma meantone is the basis of
European music.

Incidentally, I wasn't previously aware of the Levy article (book?)
either.  Could you give details?

B C Deva, in "The Music of India: A Scientific Study" gives an unequal,
just 22 note scale.  Having at least the pretence of scientific rigour,
he goes on to measure it against an instrument.  Alas, I didn't realise
I was going to get into an argument about this, so I didn't take proper
notes.  The measured scale is more than 8 cents out from the
theoretical one.  However, most of the commas are preserved at about 20
cents, so we certainly aren't talking about equal temperament.

This scale has a certain contemporary relevence.  I did come across it
on the Web.  Try hypatia.ucsc.edu:70/1/RELATED/Batish/Archives/Rago1

T V Subba Rao's "Studies in Indian Music", my primary (alright, only)
source on the South Indian tradition, explicitly states that the srutis
are not 22 or 24 equal.

Hariprasad Chaurasia says the same in this month's Wire.  The 22 note
scale is dead in North India, but it's ghost still haunts those who
refuse to admit of more than 12 notes to the octave :-)

I'm more for 12 pitch classes, boring though that may be.

It is true that there is no way of specifying a major scale with 7
notes from a non-meantone temperament such that all thirds and
fifths are in tune.  However, I don't see this is being such a big
problem.  Neither, presumably, did Bharata, whose gramas give the
following major scales:

Sa-grama 4 3 2 4 4 3 2
Ma-grama 4 3 2 4 3 4 2

Each scale contains a mistuned fifth, which Bharata did claim as
a dissonance.  Bharata's srutis are nominally equal, however I
still do not see why these scales could not be just.  The interval
of 8 srutis would then be a Pythagorean major third of 408 cents.
This scale sounds fine, melodically, to my ears.  In Ma-grama, only
one (minor) third is mistuned.

All of which is very interesting, but says nothing about the
subsequent millenium.  Subba Rao allowed for a note in a raga to have
more than one sruti interpretation, but I don' t have a reference to
hand.  Although he didn't give any examples of how a scale or phrase
should be tuned in terms of srutis, the implication is obviously that
mistuned consonances can be avoided.

6 of the 17 Sa-Ga intervals measured by Jairazbhoy and Stone in
"Intonation in Present Day North Indian Classical Music" are larger
than 408 cents, although a 22 note scale is obviously not being used.
The largest third of 439 cents is >436.  This comes from the flautist
Pannalal Ghosh.  The largest vocal third is 405 cents from Gangoobai
Hangal.  None of this contradicts the spirit of what Gregg says.
