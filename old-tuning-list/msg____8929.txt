I looked into this. One fact is that in order for Amazon to carry the
CD, it must have a UPC code (so they can track their inventory).
When I followed the UPC links, it looks like its easy to get a number,
but it costs about $350 to become a "manufacturer" (six digits) and
then you have access to five digits (10,000 different) individual product
numbers. 

Since I am not currently planning to release 10,000 different CDs
(in the near term) it made me wonder if maybe there would be a way
to "go in on" a number with a few people, or to find someone who already
has a UPC number and would be willing to share/sell/rent a number or two.

Has anyone done this before?
