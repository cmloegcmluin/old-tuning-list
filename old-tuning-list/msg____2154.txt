How would you guess the sixth root of two????

My point seems to be lost.  We all seem so delighted with the ease at which
we are able to do these things.  So let me shed some additional light on the 
subject.

Hindu-Arabic number system along with its place holder notation was assimilated
by west around 825 A.D.  The decimal system appears about 1600 A.D. and shortly
thereafter we get logarithms.  Next comes the 2 space coordinate system followed
by Calculus.  With calculus we get a deep insight into the nature of solving
problems which previously were very demanding even though solutions of sorts
had been known for millenniums.

To guess the sixth root of two?  The method thought to be employed since Greek
times for comparing the sizes of two ratios is that of continued fractions.  It
ain't easy by a long shot.  

As for the post from our pool player (I don't have his name either only his 
Email address) which gave the formula for the twelfth with the powers of eleven,
this formula is a direct result of Newton's Method hence it requires the knowledge
of Calculus.  I believe that the same could be said about Manuel Op de Coul's
formula.  I think there is a slight difference between his and the Babylonian
rendition.   I looked up in my Math History textbook and found that the 
Babylonians were able to do cube roots.  The Chinese have had a type of decimal
system for nearly as long with algorithms for these two problems as well.  

I also remember reading that the man who discovered logarithms used the twelfth
root of two as the first problem solved using this new system.  

I believe that the answer was not as important to them as was the method and its
basis were, or what they could learn about the deeper nature of things by 
studying the problem.  Such is the life of a mathematician.
