I think so, too. You should probably look into one of the larger
national ISP's, like Webcom. You might also want to consider getting a
domain name, like "garytunes.com," which would enable you to move from
one ISP to another without changing your address. It isn't cheap -- $200
to start, plus $50 every two years to maintain -- but depending on your
purposes, it may be worth the investment.

In addition to site space, you might also want to ask whether the ISP
provides access to the logs of hits to your site. Many of the smaller
ones don't. You'll see how many people a day hit the site, where they're
from, and what pages they visited. These logs can be interesting, and
especially useful if you're promoting an event or a product and want to
check out the effectiveness of your efforts.
