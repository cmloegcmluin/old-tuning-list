Subject: RE:K2000 & Tuning

From: Gary <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

I am certainly no expert on the K2000, but a friend of mine at work has been
wrestling with it (on his  K2500), and he has concluded, possibly falsely that
you can retune notes these ways:
1.  You can can tune a CONSTANT gap between ALL pairs of adjacent keys.  In 
    other words you can set a gap between a pair of adjacent keys, but it has
    to be the same between all adjacent-key pairs.  He said that its resolution
    was two-cent, not single cent.
2.  Simultaneously in some sense, you can set the pitch of each key to much
    higher resolution provided that the tuning repeats in octaves of 12 keys.
This works fine for tuning, for example, 12-toned JI or meantone scales.  Or it
will work fine for tuning all keys to an equal-temperament whose step-size is a
multiple of 2 cents.  What it will not work for is such things as laying 19-tone
equal-temperament "linearly" across the keyboard, such that the octave above a
given C is the G visually a twelfth above it.  That seems to be a very popular
approach, although I'll be darned if I can figure out how so many people
(including Harry Partch) can function that way.  

   The third thing you can do is to individually duplicate each ... forgive me I
only know the Ensoniq term ... wavesample across a single key and then tune each
wavesample as needed.  

   Correct me if I'm incorrect.  I'm sure my friend would be pleased to find out
if he's missed something.
