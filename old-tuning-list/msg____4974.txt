    This is the perfect place to post something I copied, (perhaps from this
list last year). I have been wanting to post this for a long time,  and since
we have the spiritual flag waving on a "Stick", this seems to be the perfect
time for it.  

"The physical Universe is an aggregate of frequencies.  Each chemical
element is uniquely identifiable in the electromagnetic specturm by its
special set of unique frequencies.  These frequency sets interact to produce
more
complexly unique cycle frequencies, which are unheard by human ear
but which resonate just as do humanly hearable musical chords or dissonances.
       Thus occurs a great cosmic orchestration, ranging from the microcosmic
nuclear isotropicity -- directly undetectable by the human senses -- through
the minuscule range detectable by humans, to the very complex macrocosmic,
supra-to-human-tunability symphonies of multiaggregates of isotropically
 interpositioned galaxies."  
 R. Buckminster Fuller
