Subject: Perishable tunings and other permutations?

From: Charles Lucy <lucy@ilhawaii.net>

All this chat about meantone tuning is very interesting, yet it
would seem very difficult to affirm the details of which tunings
were used on keyboard instruments, as the tuning is perishable.
 
Does anyone have access to physical fretted instruments from the
periods in question, so that fret, nut and bridge distances may
be measured?
