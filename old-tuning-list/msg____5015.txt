I agree with Daniel Wolf that Indian tuning varies.  Using the 
solfeggio system, Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Da Ni Sa, which is used similarly
to Do, Re Me ... , the starting point for fsingers is very flexible.
I've seen Sa shown most often in western notation starting on
C.  So I would expect A to correspond to Da rather than Ni.
According to Danielou (Northern Indian Music) which is controversioal,
but which is the one that I've seen which actually gives a
precise tuning, the tuning for Da could be 5/3 or 27/16 if it
is major, depending on the raga, and 8/5 or 128/81 if it is minor
(da komal).  The major seventh (ni tibravra)can be either 15/8 or 243/128 (which
is fairly sharp).  Basically one of the principal tunings for
each pitch is just iand one is Pythagorean.  Danielou's hypothesis
is that each raga uses a specific pitch, depending on which way
it's tuned.  Some ethnomusicaologists don't agree with him, but
I've trined the tunings of some of his ragas, and they sound
realistic, so I think it's likely that his informants did tune
this way, at least at the time he made his study (would have
been early in th e20e w20th Century, I think).  Now some fixed pitch
instruments and even equal temperament are also affecting Indian
tuning, to some degree, though on an instrument such as the
mandolin(?) S!) Srinivas does bend the pitch sometimes.  Even so,
and even though he's a famous virtuoso, I'd rather hear a sitar
any day.

Best,
