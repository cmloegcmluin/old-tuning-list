Subject: Xenharmonikon web pages

From: "J. Pusey" <pusey@remqhi.ENET.dec.com>

I have just made available several WWW pages related to Xenharmonikon at
the following URL:

    http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/xh.html

There you will find a little blurb about XH as well as links to three
other pages: tables of contents, author index, and title index, for all
volumes through XH 15. (As soon as XH 16 becomes available, I will
update these pages to include that information.) As John Chalmers will
tell you, I am not associated with Xenharmonikon in any way. I am merely
providing these web pages as a service to the xenharmonic community.

Stay tuned -- I'll be posting more xenharmonic web pages in the future
(as time permits).
