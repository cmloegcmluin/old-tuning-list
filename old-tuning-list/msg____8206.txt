You're right, a point on the BM can't respond to only a single 
frequency.  Instead each point acts like a bandpass filter. 
Excitation causes a travelling wave to move down the BM, and 
different frequency components of the wave peak at different places 
as it progresses.  The portion of the BM nearest the middle ear is 
stiffest and responds best to high frequencies, and the membrane 
becomes increasingly floppy along its length, lowering the "best 
frequency" of the bandpass filters.
