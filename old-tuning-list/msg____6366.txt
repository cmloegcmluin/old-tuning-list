But your work around here is very much appreciated.  It is due to my
attending High School that my background in math is poor and/or
non-existent.  High School physics had a similar effect on my understanding
of acoustics, and I have had no prior exposure to the Plomp work outside of
this digest since issue 1190 or so.

However, I think I get the gyst of this.  I will have to go over it some
more to be sure.  It seems that if you wrote a short book to explain this
and other things about acoustics to the average musician, you'd be doing a
service to mankind.

So correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this tend to support that measuring
the cent detuning of Just intervals does not messure change in dissonance?
Wouldn't it also tend to support that a 2 cent detuning of the 19/16 could
produce "a first-order qualitative difference"?
