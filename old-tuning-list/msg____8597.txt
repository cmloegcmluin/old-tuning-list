Subject: WAVmaker III

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	I just came across this software at the Softsynths homepage

http://www.interlog.com/~willwong/softsynths/home.html

WAVmaker seems to be a software synthesizer (I haven't had a chance to do 
much with it at the time of this writing) that has built in tuning tables 
for 19TET 31TET and just intonation, but one can add any tuning one cares 
to specify. It will take .wav files as samples for its voices, and has a 
number of interesting sounding capabilities. I am going to work with it 
for a while, and I'll let you know if it lives up to its advertisement. 
This is shareware with a number of prices depending on the level of 
program one orders ($30-$70).
