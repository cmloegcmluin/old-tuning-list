   Dan's point is certainly valuable, and very amusingly put, but I think
personally that there's only so much validity to it.  

   I spent several years working on a program that decomposes musical tones
into envelopes of harmonics or near-harmonics.  Based upon that experience,
I really think it's fair to say that all of the common string and wind
instruments have partials at frequencies sufficiently close to harmonics
that, for the vast majority of musical purposes, they can be considered
practically harmonic.  

   You will find a fair number of subharmonics in those tones, by the way. 


   Dan's point about very short notes is definitely an important caveat to
that.  But those have to be very short notes indeed.  

   Of course bells, timpani, xylophones, and of course snare drums, for
example, are an entirely different question altogether.  The piano is
definitely on the hairy edge, but still falls on the harmonic side.
