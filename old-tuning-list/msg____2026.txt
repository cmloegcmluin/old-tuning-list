Subject: Re: mic blues ensemble

From: World Harmony Project <sejic@freenet.ufl.edu>

Neiel Haversticks recent post about blues incited me to tell about an 
idea that has been with me for some time: It seems to me that an ideal 
way of "tuning up" music in such genres as country, blues, bluegras, 
folk, etc. would be to form an ensemble that uses instruments which are 
native to the genres AND are capable of variable intonation. One possible 
grouping (subsets could be used as well) follows:

- Upright string bass (or fretless electric bass)
- Dobro or lap steel guitar (or pedal steel)
- Fretless banjo
- Harmonica (The Hohner catalog shows most models to be in Just Intonation)
- Human voice

Any other ideas?
