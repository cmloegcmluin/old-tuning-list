Subject: Continued Fraction Problems

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

A couple of math-type queries  for anyone who can answer them:

1)In my study of E.Dunne's page on Pianos & Contd. Fractions, I have come 
to the halt in trying to figure out how one obtains the contd. fraction 
expansion for a logaritm,in this case,log[2](3).I've  understood how one 
obtains Contd. Fractions in general,but I assume for a log one might 
require a tool such as that for sq.roots in the denominator (multiplying 
the top  & bottom of the fraction by (sq.rt.2 + 1).

2)In Dunne's excursion into using the maj 3rd (5/4) for the computation 
(on how many notes could be there in an ET octave), where ( log[2](5/4) = 
log[2](5) - log[2](4) )He says "since log[2](4) is an integer,the crux of 
the approximation is
that of log[2](5) . Why is log [2](4) to be ignored ?


3)What the world desperately needs is a web site dealing with math for 
music,sort of a 'Math for Absolute Dummies ' !!! I'm telling you, a lot 
of people could be put off by the math involved in microtonality.Good 
thing I'm the persistant type !


Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Drew
