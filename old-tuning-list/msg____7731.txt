According to Goldstein, the precision with which frequency information is
transmitted to the brain’s central pitch processor is between 0.6% and 1.2%
within a certain optimal frequency range. Goldstein, J. L. 1973. “An
optimum processor theory for the central formation of the pitch of complex
tones.” J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. Vol. 54 p. 1499. The roughness component is
somewhat more permissive as to mistuning, but a 1% standard deviation would
cause the
accuracy to fall below 1/2 at around the point where benign beating begins
to gives way to the roughness effects of the critical band.

..Just wondering what this means.  It deals with mistuning plus or minus
0.3% - 0.6% of a dyad's logorithmic size?  No?  What then?  And what does
it say can percieve about an interval so mistuned?
