The semitones in LucyTuning are different enough to both be useful.
The chromatic semitone had a mysterious sound that is quite audible.
Whether it can be sung accurately is another matter.  It is right on
the borderline as regards the melodic limen, but I reckon a _good_
singer, with the right training, could manage it.  I don't place
much importance on this, however, because temperament is only an
issue for fixed pitch intruments.  The vocals can take care of
themselves -- witness rock with 12 equal guitars.

No consonant chords are deteriorated in LucyTuning relative to 19
equal.  19 notes will get you a long way, modulation wise.

An existentialist is someone who believes existence precedes essence.
Is that clear?  Oh, um, well ...  In this case, I simply mean that
the fact I use such temperaments means that I must approve of them.
The justifications I give may not be my real reasons, but it is
beyond doubt that such reasons exist.

The two temperaments I use most often -- and therefore the ones I
must value most highly -- are 31 equal and a schismic fourth mapping.
31 equal needs no introduction, of course.  I use a 12 note mapping
-to a conventional keyboard, usually with Ab rather than G#.  I
sometimes use other meantone temperaments with the same mapping.
I am fully aware of the simplifications that result with meantone.
I prefer 31 equal because of its good septimal approximations.
Actually, the second scale (after 12 equal) I ever tuned up is a
subset of 19 equal.  It is a good way of cutting your meantone
teeth, because of the high contrast between different semitones.

Now, to the schismic fourth.  I outlined this on the list before.
To summarise, it uses schismic temperament (a major third is
associated with -8 rather than +4 fifths) with 12 steps to a fourth.
This is consistent with 29 equal.  The actual tuning I use is near
enough Pythagorean.  This mapping is harder to use than the
meantone one, but the advantage is in purer intervals and more
melodic sublety.  The more I use it, the more I get to like it.
Although the harmonies are good, I haven't worked out any chord
sequences yet, other than approximations of standard diatonic ones,
which require comma shifts.

Being able to use such small intervals means you can add an
emotional edge not usually possible on a fixed pitch instrument.
And, when you want a pure interval, it's really ease to find.
If I want, I can get a mistuned affect by hitting the "wrong"
keys.

Originally, I was tuned to 53 equal.  As well as the relatively poor
septimal approximations, I didn't like the commas being so small.
They have a sort of distressing sound as a result of being barely
audible, and can't function melodically.  Switching to 41 equal
solved both problems.  After some theoretical work, though, I found
the better approximation.  The commas are smaller -- slightly larger
than Pythagorean -- but just large enough to be audible.

I'm also starting to play with 22 equal, now that I've got a
symmetrical keyboard.  I have previously used Paul Erlich's 22 note
mapping with 46 equal.  I gave up on this because I decided the
schismic mapping works better, although it has even more notes.

I have made some use of 7 and 5 equal, extended just intonations,
and various "ethnic" tunings.


If acoustic instruments are to be liberated from 12 equal, I
suggest they be designed to play in the widest possible variety
of tunings, rather than simply adopting a new temperament.  The
choice of tuning is as personal as orchestration and would, in an
ideal world, be available to all composers.

I can't see it's at all reasonable to expect the world in general to
switch to 19 equal.  It may work for wind instruments, as a template
from which to bend to 7-limit harmony, but it is too extreme for
people to accept it otherwise.  By "extreme" I mean relative to 12
equal which has a special place as all other temperaments are, in a
sense derived from it.  12 equal is a meantone, schismic and
diaschismic scale.  As Gregg observed, other scales tend to be
melodically confounded with 12 pitch classes.  Orchestral instruments
incompatible with the repertoire of -- like it or not -- 12 biased
music aren't going to catch on.
