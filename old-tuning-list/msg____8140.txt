Subject: An Aside:  MIME Format

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

Sorry, but this is perhaps more tuning-list-related than
tuning-related.

   

I periodically receive this:
---------------------------
> This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

   I sure thought that Netscape mail, which is what I am (now) using to
read my Email, understands MIME format.  I know it has an option to send
it at least.

   Is this perhaps some abberation of the message going through the list
processor?
