This is just to say, I've been having window repair at home - apologies 
for lack in response.  New energy-efficient windows (really for 
soundproofing but someone's gotta cover the tax advantage).

Gangs of happy Bronx dudes hanging out the 12th story at my place.
No windows at all - just big gaping holes.  Makes for some amazing
soot and pollution during daytime - so I've kept the computer
gear and my gong collection under wraps.
