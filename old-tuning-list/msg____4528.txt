   In that particular case I'm almost certain that would gets the guitar
string to vibrate is the sound waves from your voice vibrating the
soundboard, which vibrates the strings.  FAR less, I believe you'll find is
a result of the air directly exciting the strings themselves.  

   Try it with a solid-body guitar on headphones and I'd be surprised if
you hear much.  (I've never tried it myself, so I may be surprised as
well.)
