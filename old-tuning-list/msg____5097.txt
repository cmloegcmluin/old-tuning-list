Subject: Re: Natural Phenomena and Microtones

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

The exchange between Neil Haverstick and Paul Hahn got me thinking.  At
first, Paul makes eminent sense about going too far afield looking for
intervallic relevance in seemingly unrelated natural occurrence.  And I
don't share Neil's passion for religious connection to art, as did so many
of the Baroque musicians that equated the major triad with the trinity.

However, in practice I have had great success in mapping out diverse
natural phenomena and employed them successfully in my compositions.
Examples include mapping the splittings of cosmic rays (Cosmic Rays String
Quartet), golden mean (in Dune for bassoon), and quadratic primes (in Rama
for trombone).  

Using material from other semantic realms seems the very stuff of music
material, certainly in the words we use to describe the nearly ineffable
qualities of music.  Iannis Xenakis recently announced in NYC "Sound and
visual things are very close in the mind, but we are not conscious of
that," and he's an accomplished architect.

For weeks I have been teaching my classes at C.W. Post the importance of
the overtone series.  I point out repeatedly how the major triad is
outlined by 4:5:6, how the "perfect" intervals are only the first 4 of the
series, how they exist as definitive consonance, how the fundamental gets
the most repeats in the series and is of the highest amplitude, second
only to the "dominant" interval of the 3rd harmonic.  I explain that
temperament surgically alters the precise intervals, and there are prescribed
directions for each precise overtone-derived interval.  To modulate
between keys is expensive in "notes needed" for sure transition and has
been culturally accepted at 12-per-octave.  12 may have to do with the
shape of our hands, the ability to visually discern "inches" of the
octave, to what seems to me the smallest number visible mathematically by
the most numbers, proportionately.

Ultimately, I come repeatedly to the conclusion that there is no overtone
series, per se.  Merely the resonance of the ordering of rational numbers
from 1, onwards.  Any thoughts on how the "overtone series" would alter if
on a different celestial object?
