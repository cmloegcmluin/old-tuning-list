Subject: Johnston's notation defended (again)

These cents approximations must be: 70 cents down -- a flat sign; 22 cents up 
-- a plus sign. Since an Fb+ is rather out-of-the-way, I'll show one way to 
arrive at an Ab+ instead, since all we're interested in is the combination of 
signs which shift the pitch in different directions. Here's one path through 
the 5-limit lattice from C to Ab+, letter-names on the left, corresponding 
ratios on the right:

            Ab+   C+                  81/50    81/80
                  F+                           27/20
                  Bb    D                      9/5     9/8
                        G                              3/2
                        C                              1/1

So, for instance, the player might be required to ascend a fifth (3/2) from C 
to G, then a minor third (6/5) from G to Bb; this process is then repeated, 
leading from Bb to F+ and finally to Ab+. Fifth, minor third, fifth, minor 
third -- nothing more complicated. Where's an Ab without a plus sign then, 
and what would that mean?
               
                Ab      C                     8/5       1/1

The Ab without further inflections is the normal just minor sixth above the 
C. An acquaintance with such lattices induces performers to think of the 
different inflection signs as steps along different axes of the lattice and 
not merely up or down a pitch continuum. Where are the conflicts then? 
Nowhere, except in the eye of someone who takes pride in refusing to discover 
how Ben Johnston's notation works. I'll assume that Johnny Reinhard is not 
taking issue with the difficulty itself, but with what he sees as unnecessary 
difficulty; but when a composer wishes that the performer should, as far as 
possible, understand and hear the intervallic relationships in the 
composition, then presenting the performer with cents deviations is no longer 
an option (and deviations from what? -- who is able to intuit frequency 
relationships based on 2^[1/12]?). Ben's notation is simply the one correct 
notation for his own music; the application of this notational system outside 
Ben's works can only be justified on the merits of individual cases. For 
Partch, it is arguably successful, but there would be little point in 
reworking, say, Xenakis's quarter-tones in any extended JI notation (in 
general, building bridges between Ptolemaic and Aristoxenian territory is a 
thankless, and usually pointless task).

Cents notation, in any case, erects an equal-tempered default, which is the 
last thing any JI composer would wish to invoke. So is Ben Johnston's 
notation the perfect language of tuning into which all systems can and should 
be translated? Not in the least. Is it the best system for Ben Johnston's 
music, with the potential for successful application in many other areas 
because of its consistency and lucidity? Yes.

A parting comment on my own theoretical home ground: I've seen various 
articles which purport to explain certain historic keyboard tunings; on 
reading through them, I find that they never go beyond cents notation, which 
cannot even begin to explain how the tunings were devised, which would 
require a mixture of ratios and inflections by the roots of one or other 
comma. The most cents notation can tell us in such circumstances is the 
audible effect of the tuning, which is very well in itself, but empty of 
explanatory content. Our lives would be very different today if the sciences 
had remained on this level of incomprehending taxonomy.

(And by the way: yes, that message to Adam Silverman was not intended for the 
list -- the first time I've made the classic e-mail list slip; on one list I 
received a message from a subscriber to his sister, asking for her advice on 
the proposal of marriage he was about to make. Mine was slightly less 
embarrassing, but bad enough.)
