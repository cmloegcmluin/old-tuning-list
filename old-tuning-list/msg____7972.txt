Subject: Partch concert in London

From: Brian Lee <blee@dircon.co.uk>

I didn't believe it when I first saw the ad in the concert programme but on
November 27th this year there is a NewBand concert on the original Partch
instruments at the Barbican Hall in London, part of the American Pioneers
series that runs from Oct to Nov. Other tunists on show in the series
include La Monte Young and Glenn Branca. The box office phone number is

0171 638 8891 (open 9am to 8pm daily)

If other tuning list folk in London, UK, Europe or wherever are planning on
going, let's arrange a meet up.
