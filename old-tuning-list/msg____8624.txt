From: Lydia Ayers <layers@cs.ust.hk>

More than a corporation, what I would like to see is an international
association, which would do some of the things already done by teh
Just Intonation Network, the AFMM, Interval, etc.

As an example, the International Computer Music Association
publishes a newsletter, puts on international conferences which
include concerts and paper presentations ... and it started small,
with just a few people organizing the first conference.  It also
has a membership directory, a Web page ...

If we started a Just Intonation Association, with David Doty in
charge of the Journal (it's already so good it doesn't need to
change) and some conferences (maybe the AFMM could get this
started, they're already putting on some concerts; and the 
guys in Denver, San Diego and Texas would be good candidates
for later venues; in a few years we could make it more international
and you could all come over here sometime; if I left anybody out,
please don't hesitate to volunteer yourself).

Best,

Lydia Ayers
