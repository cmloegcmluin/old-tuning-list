Subject: The Meadow Is Open 4 Bidness

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

Dear Tuning Inhabitants,

It's the man with the non-stop Partch-mouth.  I actually have some replies
owed, esp. to Neil, but the weekend was quite busy, um, as follows:

Since my Net service provider gave me 300k of web site space, I have decided
not to waste it.  Therefore, without further ado, please point your grand
WWW browser to:

   http://www.adnc.com/web/jszanto/welcome.html

..the home of Corporeal Meadows.  

The site itself is pretty self-explanatory.  I am not a professional Web
page designer; you won't find bells and whistles, and this is definitely an
after-hours thing.  But you *know* how much I care about Harry and his
stuff, so I will keep this in a growing, albeit slowly, state.

And hopefully this will be an easy place to contact me/us.  Let me know what
you think.  Anything on the site I already know about, so it's for
Partch-centric people, with gratitude for being interested in all Harry things.

What better thing to do, seeing as I am days away from turning 43???
I'll be back shortly with more direct answers to some of the substantial
questions posted in the last couple of days...I haven't forgotten!

See you on the Meadow...

Cheers,
Jon
