Subject: Correlation of Partch Limit with LCM

From: Mckyyy@aol.com

Since Paul E finds Partch's limit to be superior to LCM as a
predictor of consonance, I have again made an attempt to find a
definition of this concept in his book without much success.  

Having made at least some effort to wade through Partch's polemic
pronouncements, I feel I might be entitled to ask a question: 
Would it be fair to say that the Partch's limit for a given ratio
is derived by enforcing octave equivalence and then taking the
largest odd number.

Assuming that might be true, the Partch limit of 3:4:5 would be
taken by octave inverting it to 4:5:6 and then calling the limit
5?

Is a given Partch musical space defined by just one limit, or are
more required?

I would like to determine this exactly, so I can determine the
degree of correlation between LCM and the Partch Limit.
