Subject: Automated applications of Just Intonation

From: Lars Frandsen <lafrance@musik.auc.dk>

Hello everyone

This is about carrying just intonation out into practice.
I am doing my thesis at Aalborg University, Denmark, about two systems
that allows just intonation to be accesed by means of an ordinary keyboard.
(12 keys pr. octave).

<<1>> 
One such system has been developed by a Norwegian Composer
EIVIND GROVEN. It can be refered to as an enlarged
quasi-pythagorean-system (though minor tempered) , in which a system
of relays decides between two pitches for each note.

I've had contact with the department of Music, at Universitet i Oslo, 
Norway, and I learned from Arvid Vollsnes there, that somebody in the US
had begun `something' with reference to Grovens work and principles.

Now, can I be that lucky, that this/those person(s) is/are reading this ?
If so, PLEASE let me know. Id like to hear just a bit about your hypothesis,
applications used etc.

Also, Id appreciate any information, ideas, links to articles etc etc about 
EIVIND GROVENs works and systems.

<<2>>
In 1934 an englishman, John Hathwood Compton, did a patent specification 
which descibes an improvement of  12-tempered keyboard instruments. This is
done by using two series of notes, both tempered, but tuned with different 
references. Thus it is possible to have both pure thirds (by using a note 
from each series) and nearly pure fifth (the tempered ones).

I have only got the patent specification, and no other reference to Comptons
work and doings. Did he succed in having the pattent (at least for some years)?
And - again - if anybody is able to suply any information about this system,
references, articles ..... please let me know.

<<----->>
Just as a final question, does anyone have any good references that
throughoutly covers the efforts to combine usual (or nearly-usual) 
keyboards with the just intonation?
Id appreciate ALL inputs concerning this.

If there really isn't any good reference, please let me know as well.
Then I will definitly gather informations on the subject and place it
on the Net.

Sincerely
Lars Frandsen
