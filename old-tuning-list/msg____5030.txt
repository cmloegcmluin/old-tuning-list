For the simple part of the Hydrogen spectrum explained by Rydberg etc,
the frequency ratios are 1:4:9:16... which would be quite pleasant and
under some circumstances the differences between these frequencies also
(3, 7, 9, 12, etc) which is still quite tolerable.

For heavier elements like Iron which have many many more frequencies I
suspect that it would sound like heavy metal :-)

Hey, I got to crack that joke twice in 3 days (I used at the anvil
chorus on Saturday).  There was a big concert for the opening of a large
new stadium near here (mainly for rugby).  The highlight of the night
(which was all very spectacular) was when they did the "Dance of the
Diggers" to honour the people who worked on the project.  This consisted
of two large digging machines, lit by an erie light against the dark
sky, doing a wonderfully elegant dance to the music of Swan Lake.  They
did an amazing job and at the end the digger operaters took a bow in
full evening dress.  They got an ovation.

In another post in this thread, based on my statement:

It is only well accepted by people who don't understand it.  The people
who made the dicoveries that are supposed to have discredited the ether,
namely Einstein, Michelson, Lorentz etc, all continued to believe in an
ether.  If you doubt this, read Einstein's speech on the subject
delivered in 1920.  It is on the WWW, just search for "einstein ether".
There is no reason not to believe in an ether (except fashion).
