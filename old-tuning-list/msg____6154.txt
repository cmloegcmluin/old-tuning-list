The reasons for this are based in a concept for which Paul Erlich coined
the term "consistency".  Paul E. and I had a lengthy discussion on this
some time back in which some variations and extensions of the concept
also came up, but in brief an ET is consistent within a given harmonic
limit if the ET's approximation of harmonic intervals within that limit
is distributive.  Example: 12TET is consistent within the 5-limit
because 5/4 is approximated by 4 steps, 6/5 is approximated by 3 steps,
and their product 3/2 is approximated by 7 steps.

To get back to the question, 22TET is consistent up to the 11-limit,
while 24TET is only consistent to the 5-limit.  (In this respect it is
actually worse than its subset 12TET, which is consistent to the
9-limit.)

Peter, if you are interested I could dredge up some of the messages from
the last time we discussed this.  (Hey, is the list archived anywhere?)
