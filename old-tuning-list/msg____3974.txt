I believe that William Coates also has one of Fokker's archifoon 
instruments. He lived in England when I met him but moved to Australia. 
As far as I know, only four of these instruments were built. But it wins 
the prize on quantity, as there were only three generalized-keyboard 
Scalatrons built.

We certainly need a generalized keyboard driving MIDI or some equivalent. 
These days this should not be hard to build. Does anyone have any 
knowledge of the status of various attempts in their various stages?
