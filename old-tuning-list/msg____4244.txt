Subject: Learn to read!

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

In _Silence_, Cage is clear: he initially rejected the term _experimental_
music - which was applied by others to his work, and used frequently, for
example, in the Columbia-Princeton studio, by Varese, in the Paris Radio
Studio and elsewhere - precisely for its association with scientific
method. Cage was quite familiar with the language of science, having edited
technical publication through the second war and very likely also through
his father, a respected engineer and inventor. Cage later accepted the term
with a limited definition clearly appropriate to his musical work, and
clearly distanced from scientific work. Mr. MacLaren, please learn to
_read_ before making criticisms without foundation in fact.

I have not made a study of the term´s history, but I do recall several
mentions prior to Hiller. For example, the famous Paul Whiteman concert
where Gershwin´s _Rhapsody in Blue_ was premiered was titled **An
Experiment in Modern Music**!

Let´s get back to tuning... tonality anyone?
