Good to hear from you - hope your world is shaping up well...

>Are you two still planning to visit Cornell in Fall 99?  

yes.

>Are you visiting for one semester or two?

one.

>Can you send me a letter applying for visiting status and include a 
resume?

Sure - nothing like sending out resumes to brighten up your day!

>Will you two be in Nashville next July when we drive back across 
the US?

now for the newest news. Ann has decided to give vanderbilt the
heave-ho and is in the process of accepting a job at NASA Ames 
research center. (she's been offered the job, but is still negotiating 
details like salary and start-up $ and etc). Assuming she takes it, 
she'll be starting in February. So the liklihood of anyone being in 
nashville next summer is small and diminishing rapidly. 

I had a nice chat with phil and the other grad students at allerton.... 
theres going to be lots of cool stuff to work on....

Oh yeah, where should I send the resume and letter?
