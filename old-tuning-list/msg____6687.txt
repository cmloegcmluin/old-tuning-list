Subject: 19 and only 19

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

"Paul Ehrlich is not without precedent in his fondness for this system [22
equal]. This is as far as the most charitable informed person can go in
the way of an open mind."

Most of us are fairly polite in this forum, so I will continue in that
manner. Some people should seriously admit that their presumptions are
nothing more than that. It is (to put it mildly) perverse to imply that
one system invalidates all others. This may of course come from the
equally damaging view that accepting any other system invalidates one's
own. At least the writer shows impeccable logic on this one point.

One of the many poor results of such behaviour is that we tend to write
off everything said by such people as nonsense. In the present case that
would be unfortunate indeed.

With few exceptions, this is not the way this forum has advanced over the
several years of its existence, for good reason.

Having stirred up the pot in this manner, I will now put the lid back on,
turn down the heat, and leave the room.
