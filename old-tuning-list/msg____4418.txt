   Well, I suspect that you're probably better off with a largely
historical model rather than any sort of theoretical one.  Once people
became convinced that building chords in thirds was the way to go, they
started with smaller stacks of diatonic thirds and later progressed to
larger ones.  

   In other words, it may just be a matter of "well, that's just how it
happened" more than there being really clear reasons.  But there certainly
is merit to the theoretical possibilities you're suggesting.
