Subject: Software for temperaments

From: David Griffel <D.Griffel@bristol.ac.uk>

Shortly after I asked a question here about software for playing a Midi 
keyboard in temperaments, I found a discussion on hpschd-l about 
exactly that:

"The RealTime Tuner is a freeware Macintosh program for musicians       
who are interested in alternative tunings, or who might become 
interested in them if they had a convenient way of experimenting with 
them. The use of tunings other than standard Equal Temperament adds a 
fascinating extra dimension to the musical experience. 

The program makes it possible to play a MIDI instrument in any 
twelve-tone temperament. It also provides ways of shifting the         
temperament to center on a different tonic key, and to do this instantly
as the music progresses."

If only there were a PC version ...
