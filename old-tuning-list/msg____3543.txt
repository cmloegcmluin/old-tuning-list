Subject: mclaren's opinion of CDR technology

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

As a novice but successful user of CDR over the last few weeks, I was 
puzzled by Brian Mclaren's statements about the reliability of CDR 
technology (it always worked for me). I therefore forwarded his post to 
Dana Parker, an editor at CD ROM Professional magazine for comment. I 
recieved a reply that she said I could distribute freely, so I will post 
it. Although it is rather lengthy, it is no longer than some of Brians 
posts, and I believe it addresses an important issue--whether CDR is 
reliable enough as a means of distribution of music for the microtonal 
composer. I am inclined to be more gentle towards mclaren than she is, as 
I believe he may have been misled by faulty advice from his experts, but 
I think the readers of this forum deserve as much info as possible on 
this new technology.
