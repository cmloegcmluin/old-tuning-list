Well, you asked for it.

I've been spending some time putting up a home page for Antonio Soler, at:

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/izumirm/solerpag.htm

which includes some MIDI files (in equal temperament, tho I'm thinking about
using the pitch-bend method to convert them to Valotti or Werckmeister. But
that's another project...).

During the course of my research for this, I discovered that Soler invented a
device he called an "affinador", for dividing the scale into 20 tones. But there
seems to be very little information on this, or on Soler's contribution to
microtonalism.

Does anybody have more information on this topic, or on early (1600-1700's)
microtonal pioneers?

TIA.
