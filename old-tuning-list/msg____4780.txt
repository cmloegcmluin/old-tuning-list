It's that Starrett creep again-

Neil Haverstick wrote
" Forgive me if I didn't get it quite right, but I believe Starrett said 
that the Harmonic series was more of a mental construct than a physical 
reality, because nothing in Nature vibrates precisely at the frequencies of 
the Harmonic series. If this be the case, then what's all the fuss about 
"just intonation" in the first place?"

	I suppose I may have been insufficiently clear in my writing. 
My point is (and perhaps I misunderstood Neil's original statement) that 
I don't see how one can say that the harmonic series is the "pure" basis 
for music as opposed to, for instance, the priciple of small number 
ratios. Certainly people can hear the harmonic partials of a complex tone 
and infer melody and harmony from that, but they can also hear simple tones 
in "simple" pitch relationships and infer melody and harmony from this.  
	If we really have some kind of "built in" mechanism for understanding 
and appreciating constructions of sound, it seems more likely to me that this 
mechanism is broadly based, and encompasses a wide variety of different pitch 
realtionships. I love the sound of harmonic series music-I sing "ragas" 
in my shop to the hum and whine of the machine tools. But I also love the 
sound of 5/3 and 8/5, and they do not exist as ratios in the harmonic 
series relative to the fundamental except as a limit of a subsequence 
of the series (divided into the octave as usual). 
	We have a natural bent to play music, speak language and do 
mathematics. There are deep beautiful structures in all of these 
activities, and human beings are complex and flexible creatures. We 
understand and create from many different points of view. This suggests 
to me that our appreciation of music is not so simple as to be based on 
the principle of the harmonic series alone.
