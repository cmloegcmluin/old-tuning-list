Subject: 10TET's, 7/4, you name it

Gary Dude:

Nice to hear some talk about 7/4's for a change.  Hey I want your
impression of something:

You talk about 10TET (and my own forum CD piece) as Decatonic.
That's like saying Octatonic is 8TET, right?

I say Decatonic to mean 10 intervals, but in two sizes
(like the old Messiaen, Stravinsky stuff) the way Octatonic
has whole step, half step, etc.  Then, with my music, still 
in ET's, we get Extended Octatonics where the big intervals
stay the same but side intervals get narrower, like 60cent,
80 cent, etc.

In "Pient Molles" (forum CD piece), it's  5 240-cent big pieces
with 60-cent small pieces in between.

But your stuff was, in fact, 120cent (one size) 10TET?
