It is true that there are a lot of people today who can tune a passable
12TET with no more reference than a starting pitch.  But Jorgensen (thanks
for the name) and others point out that this technique was not known until
late in the nineteenth century.  There are no early  references to
counting beats per second, etc.  One of the feature of Meantone tunings
(and well-tempered tunings are a sub-category of mean-tone) is that they
depend upon finding the 'mean' pitch.  A common 18th century technique
would have you tune several intervals purely, then advise: Tune D to Bb
purely.  Now sharpen the D until Bb/D beats at the same rate as D/F#.
Most anyone without too much experience can do this.  It takes a LOT of
practice to hear 12TET thirds and fifths.
