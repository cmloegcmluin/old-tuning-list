Subject: 19 tone/20 tone

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Gregg Gibson mentioned that 20 tone eq temp was not worthy of
consideration, or something to that effect...I want to say that guitarist
Dan Stearns uses 20 eq, and creates music of great depth and power with
it. In my opinion, he is possibly the most innovative rock guitarist at
this time (that I have personally heard). His technique is jaw dropping,
his ideas are unique, and his compositions are quite original and modern.
Contact Dan at Box 701, Rutland Ma. 01543, and get a copy of his
tape.

    Bob Lee...I have always thought pedal steel was a great axe...I have
played a lot of country over the years, and have ran into a lot of pedal
steel players. It is, indeed, a great micro instrument (have you ever
heard Buzz Evans?). I have been playing 19 tone eq for over 8 years, and
would be happy to chat about it with you. Post me personally if you
wish. I also have recorded an original country style piece in 19, which I
will send you if you post me your address...be in touch.

    Also, if you're looking for that last minute xmas gift, why not try
one of my 2 CD's, "The Gate," featuring music in 12 and 19 tone tunings
(electric blues rock), or "Acoustic Stick," acoustic music in 19 and 34
tone eq temps...Box 150271, Lakewood, Colorado 80215...$10, plus $2
postage...also, a belated thanks to Gary Morrison, who unselfishly helped
me out with a last minute grant to finish the "Acoustic Stick"
project...a true microhero...Hstick
