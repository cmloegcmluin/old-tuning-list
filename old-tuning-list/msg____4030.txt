And wouldn't that be Brian's problem just a *teensy* bit? :-). I appreciate
your apologia, Gary - but couldn't you have a word with Brian about how much
better he'd come across by using a little judicious editing [replacing "X is"
with "I believe X is" as a simple example]? I know for a fact that John Chalmers
has attempted to proffer some advice about digital epistolary comportment, and
my reading of Brian's return seems to suggest that it's had little effect.
Perhaps
you'll be more successful - is Brian's seeming need for spleen-venting *so*
important that it requires a regular squad of disclaimers from his pals and
so necessary that it runs the risk of having Brian marginalize *himself,* as
he seems to be doing? I can't imagine that that's what he really wants.

On a somewhat happier note, the estimable Dr. Bill Sethares [up and coming
erhu player and globe-hopping bon vivant], in the course of some discussion
about his contribution to my upcoming non12TET broadcast special, has
mentioned that there are plans in the works to produce a CD containing some
of the work of his that we've heard. It wasn't clear how much of this might be
is pieces derived from his work in timbre/tuning and how much might exploit
his current interest in adaptive tunings, but I hope he won't mind my suggesting
that a number of you might be wishing to save your pennies. Bill's work is
pretty wonderful stuff, and I'm delighted at the thought that it may see a
little
wider audience. If he doesn't mention the thing when it comes out, rest assured
that I *will.* [usual disclaimer on my not benefitting from his work, etc.].
WATCH THIS SPACE.

with regards,
Gregory Taylor
