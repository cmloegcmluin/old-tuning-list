Subject: RE: Iranian music

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

I would propose that the lens we look through in analyzing the 
similarities/relationships between musics of antiquity be aimed at 
whether or not the 4/3 is prominent.  The tetrachords of ancient Greece 
kept the 4/3 inviolable, even as they could be connected for over 2 
octaves and could modulate.  Similarly they serve as pillars to Iranian 
music as recently pointed out by Mr. Moradi in his latest post.  
Likewise, Bulgarian music maintains this 4/3 essence, even as smaller 
intervals are reputed to have no proper names.  

In Iran the Dastgah is 4/3 concerned, which is then part of a larger 
Maqam.  Persian/Greek/Thracian (now Bulgarian) were connected musical 
cultures that counted on the stability of the 4/3.  

The 3/2 as a basic building block for scales, as 3-limit just intonation, 
as an ingredient in the aforementioned systems, is paramount in many 
other musics.  These include Babylonia and Sumer (according to tablets 
found over a decade ago and reported in the California press), European 
Middle Ages (probably of Celt origin), much of Chinese music, etc.  Our 
inherited 12ET is a temperament of this interval, even as it is 11th 
comma meantone, a homogenization of 12 well-tempered or unequal tuning 
(for reasons of performers travelling for concerts with new orchestras), 
an accomadation within 16 cents of 5-limit just intonation, etc.
