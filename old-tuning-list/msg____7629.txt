   They are one in the same.  A loooonnng time ago, Dave put together a
wire-wrapped Z80-based single-board computer and with it did a wonderful
lecture demo tape series called "Introduction to Nontraditional Harmony",
which I think is a great, historical introduction to JI.

   I personally am pretty much a fence-sitter on the prime vs. odd
question, but perhaps it's worth asking:  Do you perceive that there's any
mechanism in our auditory system for detecting powers of two (i.e.,
octaves)?  If so, then why not powers of three or five?
