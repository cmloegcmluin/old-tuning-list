Subject: 88CET Demo Again

From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

About a month ago I mentioned that I have a new 88CET demo with more music on
it, and that I'd be happy to send copies of that demo to whoever wanted to hear
the sounds I spoke of in my 88CET posting series.  But I had to wait until my
DAT deck came home to me from the shop, since it's on a DAT master.

   Well, at long last my DAT deck fiiiiiinally made it back from the shop.  

   I have copies out to Johnny Klonaris and Randy Winchester, because I know for
sure that they asked for copies.  Did/does anybody else want a copy?
