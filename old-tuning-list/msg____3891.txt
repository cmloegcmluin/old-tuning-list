The next question for those McMaster researchers to address was whether
Neanderthals had proper lips and diaphragms for good flute technique; also,
since it has four-holes, this find must certainly tell us that Neanderthals
had a mere three digits per hand.

Next comes the terrible question of how Neanderthals notated their pitches.

Another question: did ASCAP distribute royalties for Neanderthals' campfire
performances?
