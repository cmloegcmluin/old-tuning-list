	[Loffink, John]  I would not call this microtonal.  It is just the
common filter sweep used by all "space music" artists.  The partials are
harmonic, but the chords that underly them never are.  Robert Rich and
Michael Stearns are the only ones doing space music with real microtonal
intervals.   All the others are most definitely confined within normal 12TET
composition, even though just intonation would be most appropriate for this
music, in my opinion.
