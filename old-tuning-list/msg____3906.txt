Even though you invented the term to mean something and all, Id like to add
my 2 cents to a definition.  There is Tonality, and from that - atonality,
polytonality and bitonality etc.  These words with tonality in them
describe sorts of composition methods, tricks and hints etc.  Allotonality
might be the strange methods enabled by alternative tuning systems.
