Subject:  Xenharmonic CDs
---
Time once again to give brief reviews of
the latest xenharmonic laser cookies...
First and most impressive, Marc Battier's
"Transparence."  This CD is available from
EMF, Joel Chabade's Electronic Music
Foundation.  Their catalog is available
on-line from emusic@aol.com.
Battier uses a single sentence from Henry
Chopin as source material for a virtuoso
set of digital signal processing
manipulations.  This CD is beautiful,
non-12-sounding, and endlessly varied
and interesting.
Many of the manipulations appear to center
around resonant filters: the effect is to pick
out distinctly non-12 pitches and generate
effects which sound nothing like the original
material. 
The entire CD can be thought of as a giant set
of "variations on a theme" of a single acoustic
input.  Highly recommended!
Next, Anna Homler's "Do Ya Sa Di Do."  Ms.
Homler specializes is singing what sound like
Japanese or Korean chants against sampler-
manipulated electronic backgrounds.  The
net effect is often impressive, and distinctly
outside the standard 12-tone equal-tempered
scale.
The most xenharmonic tracks on this CD are
No. 1, in which she fringes her chant with
an aureole of xenharmonic "inflexional"
pitches (as in Balinese and Javanese vocal
music, where slendro and pelog are generally
used as a pont of departure, or as in the
 vocal xenharmonies of Sinead O'Connor, 
Louis Armstrong, Ofrah Haza, et alii).
Most wildly microtonal, however, is track
9--where Ms. Homler produces squeaks and
whistles which the human vocal track does
not appear to have been designed to
accomodate.  The effect is xenharmonic,
beautiful, and altogether exotic.
The CD is available from:
Homler, PO Box 48770, Los Angeles CA
90048.
Ben Johnston's "Calamity Jane to her Daughter"
on the CD "Urban Diva" is an impressive example
of extended just intonation.  This just array
appears to extend upward to around 31-limit,
and offers a formidable challenge to the
aspiring po-mo vocalist.
Forunately, soprano Dora Ohrenstein is more
than up to the challenge.  Her rendition proves
both sonically idirescent and emotionally
compelling.
*Highly* recommended!
The CD "Urban Diva" is available from Composer's
Recordings Inc., 73 Spring St., New York NY 10012-
5800, phone # (212) 941-9673.
Last and decidedly least: Chris Brown's
"Lava."  This composition combines electronically
manipulated sounds with live percussion and
digital keyboards.  
Alas, the piece quickly grows unbearably
repetitive and wearisome.  Most of the electronic
manipulations involve uninteresting delay or
filter effects applied to inherently ugly percussive
sounds.  The result is less than impressive.
My patience did not extend to the end of this CD.
Not recommended.
