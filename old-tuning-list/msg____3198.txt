I agree completely, except that it's difficult to say that 22-TET is closer. 
The standard tonal repertory sounds good - if not better - in 19-TET. 
 22-TET fails to preserve normal diatonic relationships, and cannot be 
notated with the conventional symbols. Performing Bach or Mozart in 19 is 
trivial, while getting them to sound good in 22 would be a difficult task. 
That doesn't prevent 22 from being my favorite tuning!

I'll give Brian the benefit of the doubt and assume he was concerned stricly 
with the sound of consonant triads. 19 and 22 are both much smoother than 
12, but 19 is the smoothest. In that sense, 22 is closer than 19 to 12. But 
in that sense, 15 is even closer to 12 (15 is slightly less smooth than 12).

Is 22 a teen? Is 24 the first "adult" temperament? If so, I've got two days 
to grow up.
