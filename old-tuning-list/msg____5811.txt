A 2-D scale is linear with octave invariance, because each point
will lie on a line drawn on Paul's cylinder, at the intersections
with the original lattice.  I generally don't like this idea of
"linear temperaments" because it places too strong an emphasis on
octave invariance.  However, if you define a temperament as "a
formula that produces a scale" that would make the difference.

Applying octave invariance would wrap 3-D pitch space into a
hypercylinder.  Note that there would be two straight lines
connecting any two points in this hypercylinder, so this space
would also imply inversional invariance.  A meantone would then
wrap this into a toroidal hyperprism, and an ET a hypertorus.
Quite something, given that an integer CET or TET would be a
finite set of points in this hypertorus, having a Hausdorff
dimension of zero.  Anyway, back to Earth:

This is a 1-D scale approximating 5-D harmony in my terminology,
including 2 and implying 9.  Call it an ET approximating the
11-limit if you prefer.  However, I would certainly not say that
the scale is 5 dimensional, rather that you are mapping it to a
5-dimensional space.  The number of points in the full 5-D real
pitch space depends linearly upon the number of octaves you look
at, hence the scale has a Hausdorff dimension of 1.  I wouldn't
say that adding a direction for 9 alters the dimension.  A
definition, then:

The dimension of a scale is the smallest number of fundamental
intervals (FIs) such that every interval in the scale is a linear
combination of integer multiples (phew!) of those FIs.  This
implies that none of the FIs can be a linear combination of
integer multiples of the others.  The FIs would be real numbers
denoting the interval size in octaves, c*nts, or some such unit.
Distinct prime numbers always constitute a set of FIs.  Note the
analogy reals->vectors, integers->scalars.
