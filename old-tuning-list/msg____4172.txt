Subject: Gen. Kybd. from Wilson

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

I visited the Starr Labs web site mentioned in the recent message from
Fred Kohler (Thanks Fred!!!!!)

Apparently Erv Wilson has given a design to engineer Harvey Starr to build
which would include 546 velocity-sensitive keys which are each about
one inch apart. Starr says he expects that the units will be available in
the Spring for about $3500.

I suggested to Starr that he include a transparent envelope over the keys
like on the Clavette, and he replied that I should talk to Erv Wilson about
this, since he's doing it for him.

I guess Erv is not on this e-mail list, so I'll try to phone him after the noliday weekend. Is his Summer '95 Xenharmonic Directory information valid? If not,
could Someone in contact with him send me his current address & phone?

In all likelihood, I will not continue with my plans to build my 
"SuperClavette" if Wilson's plan is GO.

However, many musicians might not be ready to shell out $3500, perhaps
even many of you on this list. 

So, please answer me this by direct e-mail:

Would you personally be interested in a non-velocity sensitive keyboard
with 124 keys which would transmit hard-wired MIDI note numbers? If you'd
be willing to buy this 'stripped-down' Clavette, what would be the upper
limit of what you'd be willing to pay?

If I get enough responses, I will contact my engineer associates and see if
such a thing could be sold out there.

Personally, I'd rather just get myself a StarrLabs Uath-72 and save myself the
trouble of instrument-building, but I would like to see a few more people
in the world playing on MIDI generalized keyboards.

StarrLabs is at http://www.catalog.com/starrlab/

I'm looking forward to your direct replies.
