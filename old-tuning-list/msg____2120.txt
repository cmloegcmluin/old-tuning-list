Subject: Help Unsubscribing/transfering address

From: c marS <cmarsigl@copper.ucs.indiana.edu>

Can someone tell me how I can unsubscribe from here or if possibe
just change my email address.  I'm getting my account deleted later in the
week (actually tommorow I think)

I usually remember to save the original subscription notices, but I
guess I didn't save this one :)

BTW...Anyone use a K2000 for tunings.  I am getting one this weekend and
I was told it can do microtunings.  Then again it might have been just
some over zealous salesman...I find out later it can only change to other
12t's.

thanks

clif
