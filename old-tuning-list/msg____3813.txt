Subject: Microstock 2

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...a few words about Microstock 2...the Catler Bros
played hard and innovative in their 49 tone just system...Jon Catler's
guitar playing is a great antidote for the mostly dated sounds of such
as John McLaughlin, Allan Holdsworth, and the other fusionaires who
continue to rehash their better days...the jazz/rock scene which
spawned groups like Mahavishnu, Weather Report, and Return to Forever
is dead as a doornail with the 12 tone system...Catler is a real
innovator. The Haverstick boys did a diverse set of 19 qnd 34 tone
music, covering jazz, reggae, country satire, and out there rock/
fusion. A small (about 40) but hearty bunch of folks saw some killer
music, I'd say...the press certainly didn't cover it as well as last
year, but the Rocky Mt. News writer (Marc Shulgold, God bless him)
wrote a good piece on the Catlers. I'm already looking to next year...

John Chalmers mentioned the gig in El Paso...I will be playing 34
tone acoustic, and solo 19 tone space music...call Sonya Wayne
at 915-591-3105 for more info...
 
and boy, this list is sort of dull lately...too much polite math
talk...we need a good controversy to get things rolling...Hstick
