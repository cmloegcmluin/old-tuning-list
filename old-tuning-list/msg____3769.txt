Subject: Pitch Bend for Tuning

From: Lindsay Shaw and Paul Turner <landp@adelaide.DIALix.oz.au>

A process such as Manuel Op de Coul suggests seems feasible, but surely 
it is easier to simply retune the standard twelve pitches available in 
whichever channel(s) one needs to use, by means of sysex messages, for 
example.

Can anyone explain why this should be less easy than retuning by pitch 
bend? The only situation that springs to my mind where pitch bend would 
be the method of choice, is when the tuning system is irregular and 
changes from moment to moment.
