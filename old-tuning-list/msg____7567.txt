Just wanted to put in my 2 cents about the Microfest held in Los Angeles a
week ago.  A very stimulating evening indeed that included music by Harrison,
Partch, Arvo Part, Johnny Reinhard, George Zelenz, Esmaeel Tehrani, and Sasha
Bogdanowitsch.  All the pieces on the program had a great deal to offer.
Reinhard's performed his solo bassoon piece, DUNE, which expertly employed
innovative uses of multiphonics,  poly-microtonality, and extended
instrumental techniques.  Sasha Bogdanowitsch presented an ambitious 25 minute
chamber work in JI  featuring his exquisite vocal work.  The audience seemed
quite fascinated by the exotic language he created for the text.  He
accompanied each syllable with dance-like gestures that further expressed the
emotion inherent in the sung phrase.  Quite compelling.  The concert was
produced by John Schneider and was well attended.
