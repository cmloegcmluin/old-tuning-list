Subject: The tuning formerly know as...

From: <DFinnamore@aol.com>

In TD 1434 I asked about the name of a class of tunings that I was exploring.
No one reponded, so I'm assuming for the time being that I'm the first to take
interest in them.

Thanks to a bunch of offline help from Graham Breed, I've settled on the name
ASPluCT, for Arithmetic Series Plus a Constant Tunings, pronounced like "as
plucked."  One or two numbers are appended to the name: if only one number is
appended, it is the constant, and it is to be assumed that the simplest form
of the Arithmetic Series is added to it.  If a second number is appended, the
Series is multiplied by that number.

For example, ASPluCT-19 is tuned to the harmonics

19-20-22-25-29-34-40-47-55-64-74-85 and so forth.

ASPluCT-19, 2 would go

19-21-25-31-39-49-61-75-91-109-129-151 and so forth.

Theoretically, they extend indefinitely.  I don't yet go past 12 tones because
my synth's tuning table won't support it.  12 of them is generally more than
enough anyway!  These are not octave-repeating scales, or anything-repeating,
but simple tunings.  They provide highly sonorous, complex chords in a clearly
non-diatonic setting.  Strikingly rich and beautiful textures are easy to
find.  No one of them should be considered the basis for a large system of
music; instead, it's a good idea to become aquainted with the strengths and
weaknesses of a large number of them.  I'd encourage the more adventurous
amoung us to try a few out, see how you like them.
