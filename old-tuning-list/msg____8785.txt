   I'd be willing to bet nevertheless, that which tunings we find most ap=
pealing
is more based upon how we first experienced various intervals, or more
generally, what impressions we associate with various intervals.  For exa=
mple, I
relate very well to tunings with 7:4s in them, because I first discovered=
 them
(in approximation) 20-some-odd years ago while I was doing my 10TET guita=
r and
flute science-fair projects back in high school.  That was an exceptional=
ly
enlightening time of my life, so I tend to enjoy 7:4s a lot.

   Or a similar avenue would be what, if any, melodies various intervals =
remind
us of.  Major sixths, for example, remind me of the opening interval of T=
amino's
first aria in Die Zauberfl=F6te.  It's not impossible that other aspects =
of that
aria - perhaps its contemplative aura - also rub off on my impression of =
what a
major sixth should sound like.
