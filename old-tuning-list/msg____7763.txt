Subject: Microtonal guitar possibilities.

From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Hail the almighty microtonal Infobahn ,

I'm having a sort of eureka thing .Two  recent/current threads got me 
thinking about how it is possible to put together a microtonal guitar  
(even non-tempered) and be able to modulate through quite a few keys,etc..
The possibilities are extensive so,I'll just let you use your imagination.
 
All it entails is combining a guitar with any microtonal fretting system 
(including JI) and a Steinberger TransTrem.


Later,
Drew
