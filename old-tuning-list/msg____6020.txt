This could well be the case.  I worked out my ideas, including the
basics of interval matrices, before I joined the tuning list and so
before I realised there were other people interested in the same
stuff as me.  Naturally, I worked out my own terminology to explain
things to myself.  I'm trying to explain myself using the standard
terms where possible, but it isn't easy because most of them don't
even seem to have precise meanings, and some of my concepts also
appear to be original.

Okay.  By "this works" I meant that a 2-D scale could be
constructed such that every 5-limit interval can be defined on
that scale.  I originally added the condition that a basis should
be a tempered 2-3 plane.

A 0-comma scale is a tempered scale with a just octave and another
just interval, usually a perfect fifth.

"This temperament" is the doubly positive temperament that Paul
Erlich worked out.  I think this can be called doubly positive
temperament, as it covers all the ETs usually described as doubly
positive.  It is defined using the following matrix equation:

                          (1    0)
                     H' = (0    1)H'
                          (5.5 -2)

As this matrix involves a fraction, the tempered 2-3 plane is not
a basis.  The 0-comma scale involves a just fifth and a tritone
equal to 6 steps in 12 tet.  By my original criteria, it "doesn't
work" but non-Pythagorean bases can be chosen.  For example:

                   (s) = (-0.5 1)H'
                   (r)   ( 3  -5)

> Feel free to review you matrix/determinant stuff.

A full description of interval matrices should arrive with this
post.  Even people with a non mathematical background should be
able to follow most of it. Please ask if there's anything you
don't understand.  This post uses terminology from that one.  I've
brushed determinants under the carpet for the time being.

I'm more interested in making new computer music than describing
old music, but I am nevertheless interested in what scales are
used by different peoples at different times.  Particularly when
those scales can be defined economically by mathematics, ie JI and
ETs.  FWIW, I've now worked out 3 different 7-limit approximations
to doubly positive temperament.
