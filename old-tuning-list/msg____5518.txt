Well, if you take my comment out of the context of this thread, then it does 
need qualification.  I was referring to Western music, but not just in 
German-speaking areas.

By the 18th century, the theorists had caught up with the composers in 
accepting the consolidation of several modes into the major and minor keys.
I don't see how you can claim that the church modes continued to be 
"central" to that music.  One does not see references to a "Chopin Etude in 
the Dorian Mode", for instance.  Some people do refer to the major 
and minor keys as "modes", but that is misleading.
