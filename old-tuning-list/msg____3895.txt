Subject: notation

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

If I read a notation that says 969 for this note and 840 for that, unless
I know the theory and have memorized arbitrary numbers, these two mean
rather little. But if I have a sign for the 7th harmonic and another for the
13th, then I know the relationships and can begin to hear and produce the
intervals. 

On the other hand, I have produced music in which there is a variety of 
signs going up and down, and performers don't generally have a clue where 
the note is. Cents values would tell them.

These two problems are different sides of the issue, but I will vote for 
the first every time. The reason is that although cents notations provide 
descriptive adequacy, only something like the other one provides 
explanatory adequacy. In other words, performers can learn cents 
notation, but surely to provide the right notes they need to hear (and in 
that sense understand) the interval structures. The structures provide 
the explanation, the ability to generalize and therefore learn in the 
classical sense. The cents values by themselves are a series of referents 
without relation, rather like letters of an alphabet without words, or 
perhaps words without syntax/semantics.

None of this means that performers can't learn from cents, but they must 
go beyond the rather simple linear-looking (actually logarithmic) 
relationships they express.

Johnny? Your turn. Maybe we're not even talking about the same thing.
