But a great deal of tonal music is *not* expressed just with triads, so
I cannot agree with this statement. A major seventh or ninth or even
thirteenth can function perfectly well as a stable tonic chord in tonal
music.  This proves that "dominant function" is not a result simply of
the "density" of the chord.

Well this interval is only perceived to be "xenharmonic" if it is played
as 7/4, and I don't believe that "xenharmonicism" is a necessary
condition for the dominant seventh to function as it does.

Root movement by a fifth is certainly a powerful and satisfying
resolution of the dominant 7th chord, but it is not the only acceptable
resolution. V7 resolves well to vi (minor) as well (i.e. up a major
second), and the augmented sixth chord (e.g. g - b - d - e#) - which is
another chord that I think would be incorrectly represented by a 4-5-6-7
tuning - resolves most effectively to a major or minor chord a *minor
second* below.

The stepwise resolution of the intervals making up the tritone in both
these chords is, I believe, the *critical* factor which determines their
resolution.

If a dominant 7th chord is suspended for a while, then I think a case
can be made for a 4-5-6-7 tuning just to soften the dissonance, but then
how does the soloist tune his fourth scale note? Does he tune it as
21/16 or as 4/3 which has a much more simple and conventional
relationship to the tonic? Can a singer, for instance, really be
expected to pitch the former interval accurately when the latter is so
common and so well-defined. In my experience 21/16 expressed as a
melodic interval sounds like an out-of-tune 4/3 (in the context of
common-practice tonal music).

"Strangely" enough :) I wouldn't cite this as an argument against using
4-5-6-7.

I believe that it is the very complex ratio made between the third and
seventh of the dominant seventh (45/32) and the third and augmented
sixth of the augmented sixth chord (25/18) that makes the two notes
making up these intervals so "restless". Substituting 4-5-6-7 gives the
much simpler, and consonant, ratio of 7/5 for both.

For these reasons, and the arguments above, I really think that using
4-5-6-7 in common-practice tonal music is not appropriate.

Using this ratio in a xenharmonic music is of course a different matter!

Unless, of course, the Dominant 7th is in first or third inversion.
