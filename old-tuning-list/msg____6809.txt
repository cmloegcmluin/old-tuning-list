Subject: Re: more on indian tuning

From: Kraig Grady <kraiggrady@anaphoria.com>

I understand that the 7 cap intervals are used in erotic ragas almost
exclusively. As the flute scales differ from the 5 limit tunings, it has
been a common practice of string instruments to interpet these
subharmonic scales in terms of their owm tuning. It all gets quite
complex when it is quite possible in India (the music knows no borders)
that more ancient forms of ragas could coexist with more modern ones,
thus explaining further deviation in measured tuning (as in Levy). I
can't help thinking of Gagaku where you have Pythagorian tuning along
side the winds instruments and mouth organs who do not conform to the
kotos. That different tunings might be coexisting side by side.
	I hope my comments about Europe was taken in humor. Still so much
concern is taken with tunings being able to produce the music of the
past. The meager solutions to this problem fails to take in the past of
all the other cultures as if they are inferior or something.  The common
practice period cf Western music is barely 300 years old. The music of
India dates maybe back 2000. Who deserves the right to be called
"classical' !? There is a European conciet that its own music technology
is the correct evolutionary direction for everyone. Harmony
and counterpoint is what lead to the development to 12 et. There is
quite alot of harmony and counterpoint developed upon other lines around
the world, just as impressive.
	The condition that required everyone to play the same tuning is gone
for the most part.Recordings replace scores as the main method in which
music is shared from region to region. With eletronic a single person
can create their own "orchestra". The future holds the decision of a
tuning as being an element of the composers craft. Just as no one would
expect every artist to paint with the same colors, nor should music
makers be so limited. The end of tuning Monotheism is at hand!!!
