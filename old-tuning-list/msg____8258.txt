You might be right.  I don't have enough experience with 72 to know.  But
I'll keep it in mind.  I do know that higher-level consistency is a
beautiful concept that negotiates many factors to create a measure of how
well an equal temperament can represent JI.  Obviously, it breaks down
somewhere, when the step size gets very small.  But probably more around
612 than 34 or 69.

He claimed he never stuck to anything.  I think it is most accurate to say
that Partch composed from an infinite set of pitches, but seldom needed
more than 43 at a time.

Not in 43 pitches, no.

I don't buy it.
