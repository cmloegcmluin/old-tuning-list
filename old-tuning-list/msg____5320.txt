Subject: Ojai, Yates, halls

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Bill: Thanks for the interesting data on Peter Yates. I heard him 
lecture in the 60's on new music and have his book,"An Amateur at 
the Keyboard." What ever happened to Wesley Kuhnle's theories of
well-temperament and his tapes?

My impression of Ojai is that the retirees are also occultists. The 
(neo-) Pythagorean brotherhood (Crotona) that you pass as you enter 
the valley has its own cemetery because so many of its members died
in residence (and left their money to the center). 

The last time I visited the town, my sister took me over to see what 
is left of Krishnamurti's headquarters, Meditation Mt., and some other 
local sites, etc. 

According to my sister, Ojai is one of the few large mountain valleys 
running  East to West rather than North to South, so it was used to 
film "Lost Horizons," James Hilton's novel about the ageless valley of
Shangri-La.

Halls: Rice University in Houston recently built a new music building
with a very good concert hall and several smaller recital halls as well.
Whoever did the work, did a very good job, so you might contact the 
Shepherd School of Music at Rice. 

BTW, The organ at Stanford's Memorial Church has a meantone stop,
but I don't knwow if it also has split keys.
