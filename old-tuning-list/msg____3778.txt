Subject: MIDIBASIC

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Re Bill Sethares's post: I have sometimes used BASIC to control my
FB01 from my MAC via a BASIC Mac library called MIDIBASIC, published 
by a company called Altech in Shreveport LA. Carter Scholz wrote some 
BASIC code using calls to  MIDIBASIC routines for Arturo Salinas and me 
back in '88 to control our FB01's via fractional note-ons.

I'm  not sure if Altech Systems are  still around or supporting it, but 
it works fine on the old 68K Macs upto and including System 6.0X (I've 
run my noodling programs on an SE30 under System 6.07 with no problems). 

MIDIBASIC came in MSQuickBasic and ZBASIC flavors, but a PC version
was also listed in their cataloque. Likewise, a MIDIPASCAL was available
as well. 

I'm not sure even MSQuickBASIC runs on System 7, however, so I don't know
if MIDIBASIC can be used with later MACS or with the PPC chip.
