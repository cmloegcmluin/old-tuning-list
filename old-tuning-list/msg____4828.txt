Thanks to Matt Nathan from the cross-posting from sci.physics.acoustics. I 
have been familiar with these facts, including the integer harmonicity of 
sustained bowed strings and consistently blown wind/brass tones, for some 
time now, and have been posting to that effect recently. I'm glad to have 
more authority on my side, but it doesn't change my opinions and probably 
won't change the extent to which they are ignored. :)

Matt, I pursued the entire line of discussion with Charles Lucy years ago on 
rec.music.compose. The man is clearly interested only in promulgating his 
opinions -- any factual evidence that "supports" them he will gladly jump 
on, while all contradictory evidence or semblance of mathematical reasoning 
he evades through obfuscatory ramblings. The whole pi business is utter 
nonsense. Its value can only reside in its aesthetic appeal to musicians who 
are used to a major third being 1/3 octave. Now, you tell them, it's 1/pi 
octave. Easily enough understood, and as much mathematics as most musicians 
would want.

Despite all this, LucyTuning is about the best tuning around for the 
existing diatonic, triadic repertoire. Let me try to explain why.

First, it is a meantone tuning. This means that 5-limit just intonation is 
approached without any commas to deal with. For anyone who denies the 
importance of this, take a piece of diatonic, triadic music and try to 
render it in just intonation. Inevitably, different-sized whole tones, comma 
shifts during sustained notes, out-of-tune chords, and/or wandering tonics 
arise. Now in meantone, everything is just as easy as good old 12-equal 
(unless you start using enharmonic equivalents, since meantone is usually an 
infinite system with no enharmonic equivalents), but the maximum deviation 
from JI is reduced by a factor of 3-4.


Now meantone temperaments in general have a fifth from 692-700 cents. 
LucyTuning is almost exactly 3/10 comma meantone (.3005 comma, to be exact). 
His perfect fifth is thus flat by 3/10 comma; it is 695.493 cents. Now if 
you take all 5-limit just intervals and calculate the meantone tuning that 
minimizes the mean squared error (which is appropriate if you think 
dissonance is a function whose first derivative is zero and second 
derivative is positive at just intervals (I do)), you get a perfect fifth of 
696.165 cents. If you use a weighted mean, with weights inversely 
proportional to the limit (following Partch who said higher-limit intervals 
need to be tuned more accurately in proportion to their limit), you get a 
perfect fifth of 696.019 cents. The optimal tuning for any real musical 
situation (as long as it is diatonic and triadic) will probably fall 
somewhere between these two tunings (a very narrow range!).

Lucy is obviously very close. The 19-equal fifth is 694.737 cents, and the 
31-equal fifth is 696.774 cents. Lucy is thus doing considerably better than 
19-equal, and about as well as 31-equal. (50-equal would be almost perfect). 
It's no wonder that an eminent scholar of days past (John Harrison) 
advocated the pi-based tuning (LucyTuning). Another eminent scholar of days 
past, Christiaan Huygens, advocated 31-equal.

However, with 31-equal you get consistent and very accurate representations 
through the 11-limit, not just the 5-limit. Although an infinite tuning 
system like LucyTuning can of course approximate any pitch with any degree 
of accuarcy, you may need a very large number of notes to get all the 
harmonies you want. With 31-equal, you never need more than, uh, 31.
