I meant that if the 16- or 24-note JI scale is to appear on every
string, with no extraneaous notes, and the strings are tuned to anything
other than unisons or octaves, you'll need frets that don't go all the
way across the neck.

I'm not really sure, but what else could it be? Here's a theory: once
you get used to fretting with the very tips of your fingers, the
probability of landing too far behing a fret to get a clean tone is
virtually nil.
