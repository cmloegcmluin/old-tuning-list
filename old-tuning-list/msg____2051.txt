Yes, you can argue it that way.  And yes, you are correct in saying that
both Wm III and ET have major thirds that are larger than just.  But the
quote in question still refers to equal temperament.  Why?  Because of the
context: Most ear-tuning instructions for Circular temperaments in 18th-
century Germany relied on setting the *fifths* in order to temper the scale.
I have never seen (I don't think) 18th-century German ear tuning
instruction that use fifths as a tempering device for Equal Temperament.
They all used rows of MAJOR THIRDS which were to be made wide!
(Sorge gave explicit instructions that each successive third should be
made somewhat *wider* than the last.)  Several rows of three successive
major thirds completed the temperament (the idea was to temper the
thirds wide to close the lesser diesis; several of these "third-rows" closed
the Ditonic Comma). On the issue of tuning, C.P.E. Bach even
recommends that his readers buy Barthold Fritz's _Zuverlaessige
Anweisung._, which gives instruction for EQUAL TEMPERAMENT.

Get over it.  Bach probably wrote (at least his harpsichord works) for Equal
Temperament or something darn close to it.  Not all the revisionism in the
world can alter the *evidence.*

Kirnberger never wrote a book called "Von der Temperatur."

Yes, this is the F#-C# fifth in Kirnberger I though III.  However, it is not
tempered by 1/12 Pythagorean comma; it is tempered by the *schisma.*
Kirnberger was not the best mathematician in the world and Marpurg, in
fact, corrects Kirnberger's calculations in Marpurg's _Versuch._

This is correct.  Though I believe that Kirnberger was employed by
Princess Amalie, the sister of Frederick, not Frederick himself, as you
*might* have been implying.  If you were not implying this, ignore the last
sentence.

(1) Dutch HIP players continue to play in historical intonations (although,
frequently without regard to historical framework of period and region);

(2) I find it distressing that historical evidence continues to be ignored and
that the "temperament revisionists," standing on the shakiest of grounds
and often without being really read in the subject, continue to disseminate
disinformation that misleads people and results in performances of
dubious historical accuracy.
