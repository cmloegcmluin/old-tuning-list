Actually, it's www.wonderlandinorbit.com/projects/lullaby/

BTW, if you type it with the http part included, those viewing 
it in the most common browsers can click on in directly as a 
link rather than copying and pasting it into the browser's 
location thingy; like so:

You're returning to an ambiguous use of the word "harmonics". 
Please utilize these defined terms instead:

Partials
Harmonic Partials
Inharmonic Partials
Flageolet tones 
Ghosttones (I can accept this term since you have defined it)
Complex Tones
Simple Tones

Since you wrote **"harmonics" (ghosttones?)**, I'll
proceed with the assumption that you're talking about
the tones you get when you lightly touch a string in
various places and pluck it. I'll also give you the 
benefit of the doubt and assume that you're talking 
about the lowest audible simple tone (sine wave) for 
each ghosttone, and not the complete timbre of each 
ghosttone with its many partials. 

You're saying that the various tones you get by 
lightly touching an open string in various places 
form a continuous series separated by intervals of 
fourths and fifths. I doubt that this is so.

Please write out this series of fourths and fifths 
(in cents, or Hz, or multiplication factors
of the original open string frequency) along with 
a corresponding list of places on the string you'll have 
to touch in order to produce each of the pitches
in that series of fourths and fifths (in inches 
from bridge or nut, or portion of string length, or 
some other measure). Please explain why some positions 
in the series of fourths and fifths are skipped (do
not have a corresponding touch position), if any. I'm 
assuming the initial pitch at the beginning of the
series of is the untouched, open string. Please 
explain if this is different.

I've saved the rest of your message; let's discuss this 
much first.

Matt Nathan
