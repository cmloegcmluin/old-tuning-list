Subject: Giant's Pets

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...I am grateful for the interest in my 19 tone jazz
stuff...we finally rehearsed my 19/eq arrangement of Coltrane's "Giant
Steps" today, and it is a hoot to play. Very natural, too. Makes me
think of the discussions on this forum concerning who's a great com-
poser, and who is just an establishment darling...how rare it is to
hear folks on eartha ever mention Miles Davis, Coltrane, Ellington,
Mingus, Monk, Parker, Gillespie and many others as great composers;
yet, they were among the most important musicians of our, or any other,
time...interesting. Also, while we were rehearsing, my daughter put
party hats from her recent 7th bday on our heads...as we tackled
Auntie Wendy's tune "Beauty in the Beast, I couldn't help but think
that this was a great comment on our approach to the whole tuning
thing...Hstick
