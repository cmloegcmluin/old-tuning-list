Subject: A response to Mr. Johnny Reinhard

From: "Jonathan M. Szanto" <jszanto@adnc.com>

To the Tuning List Patrons -

> Sorry, Jon, no dice.

Johnny has dismissed me out of hand.  Allow me, at the risk of wasting precious 
bandwidth, a little response; to whit:

> Contrary to Mr. Szanto's assertions, I neither ignored nor 
> miscomprehended Mr. Partch's oeuvre.  Once again, the use of the

Yes, he did miscomprehend.  Harry Partch would have never allowed his music to be 
recreated by anything other than his instruments (what he would call a "...basic 
mutilation...").  Something that still amazes me: people want to treat Partch just 
like *any* other composer, that he wrote music, with no strings attached.  I don't 
mean that Partch was better than other composers, but he is an *altogether* 
different set of circumstances -- his own ensemble of instruments and his own (at 
least, at the time) tuning system, which simultaneously developed along with his 
repertoire.  And as if that weren't enough for us mortals, all of the corporeal 
'baggage' <g> that went along with it.  These things ARE inseparable, with the 
tiniest of disclaimers (see below).  I'd even like Ted Mook and Stephen Kalm to do 
the "Li Po" in a dramatic setting...

Oh.  Danlee was wrong to have ever agreed (if he did) to the synth.  I'll drive over 
and slap him this afternoon.

I also disagree with Dean using non-Partch instruments for the studies, but here is 
that little disclaimer: Harry *excepted* his little studies from the rigor that he 
imposed on his 'real' works; please see Partch's "These two ideas..." quote in my 
Part One reply.  You see, this isn't my idea, it's Harry's.  And while I wish Dean 
would do them with the real instruments (maybe he does now...), the fact of the 
matter is that these are JUST STUDIES, little pieces for Partch's investigation into 
tunings.  They aren't the masterworks.

True.  I can only think of one other instance where we did a non-corporeal 
performance of a piece, that being a concert version of "The Bewitched" in Cologne 
in 1981.  In both cases, they were extensions of full-scale staged productions of 
the work (Bewitched at Berlin New Music Festival, Revelation at American Music 
Theatre Festival); the Bewitched being a live-concert broadcast for West German (my, 
how times change...) Radio.  To single out one or two concerts out of the dozens I 
have known about seems, well...  But, the point is well taken: do not perform Partch 
non-corporeally.

Partch's music is not to be simply listened to, but seen, felt and experienced.  
Promoting anything less, except in a desire to 'document' a performance, is a 
cheapening of the work itself.  Go find another composer - there are lot's of them.

Wrong.  As before, Partch isn't just "a composer in this country".  Not better, but 
radically different, engendering a completely different set of circumstances, both 
when he lived and now.  Thanks for the compliment; now, maybe if Ted Mook can get 
Yo-Yo Ma, in spite of his "territoriality and protectionism", to release his 
Stradivarius cello for Ted's use, we can get a mondo-cool version of "Li Po".  
Yo-Yo, that selfish SOB.  And it seems the Partch folks aren't the only group Johnny 
has had trouble with.  Remember, I don't know JR, but have offered to correspond 
with him.

Who knows why Dean recorded it that way?  Maybe he already had it on tape?  Maybe he 
likes his Zoomoozophone?  Point is, even Dean's use of it weakens the Partch 
aesthetic, and I wish he hadn't done it, as I'm sure Danlee does too.

I'll close with a final thought.  I am not here to say "You are a good person", "You 
are a bad person"; I am offering my thoughts, having performed the literature, 
worked with Harry Partch and spent a good deal of my life helping to spread the 
amazing World of HP and his creations.  It bothers me to see phrases such as

  "a guitar "better" than Partch could hope for"
  "Drummond's hoarding of the instruments"
  "unless it is by the blessed few"
  "monopoly on his instruments"
  "territoriality and protectionism"
  
because they lower the debate to the level of bitter feelings and petty jealousies; 
if not intended, then certainly in feel.  I would suggest that if people feel left 
out of the Partch performance circle, they do as many members of the group have done 
through the years: travel to where the instruments are and make yourself available 
as a player.  Unrealistic, an unbearable sacrifice?  You betcha - just ask anyone of 
those who did just that.  And they'll tell you it was a small bit o' effort compared 
to the old boy himself, Harry.

"And the best of luck to you."

Jon
