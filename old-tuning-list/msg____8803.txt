Subject: Sensory consonance experiments with adults and infants

From: Ascend11@aol.com

Hello 

	Some work has been done on infants' abilities to discriminate between just
fifths and out-of-tune fifths as compared with their abilities to discriminate
between just and out-of-tune 45/32 tritones using social rewarding.  It was
found that they more easily discriminated between the just and out-of-tune
fifths than between just and out-of-tune 45/32 tritones.  Details are in the
paper: "Sensory consonance and the perceptual similarity of complex-tone
harmonic intervals: Tests of adult and infant listeners"  Journal of the 
Acoustical Society of America vol. 100 (5) November 1996 by E. Glenn
Schellenberg and Laurel J. Trainor.  In that paper there are references to
other research papers in this same area.
