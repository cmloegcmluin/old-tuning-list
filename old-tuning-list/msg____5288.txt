Subject: Lou Harrison - Minneapolis

From: "kris peck" <kpeck@wavetech.net>

I just found out about these concerts a couple of days ago -- I'm surprised
I hadn't already read anything on this list about it.  I thought this might
be of interest.  (Is there anyone in the Twin Cities here?)  I know this is
last minute.  The concerts are this weekend already.  I'll just quote the
little notice in the City Pages:

"LOU HARRISON MINI-FEST...  Among his Asia-phile peers, he's less oddball
than Harry Partch and more pleasure-centered than John Cage or Henry
Cowell, and given the simple and unmistakable beauty of most of his work,
it's surprising he's not more well known.  But such is the dustiness of the
classical-music world that just now, as he prepares to celebrate his 80th
birthday next month, Harrison is finally getting some of the attention he's
long deserved.  This three-day program begins Saturday night with a concert
by pianist and 20th century music booster Michael Boriskin, including works
by Harrison and a tribute composed by the pianist.  On Sunday afternoon is
a collaboration by the Schubert Club Gamelan Ensemble and the Minnesota
Contemporary Ensemble on some of Harrison's extensive catalog of
gamelan-inspired works.  Monday brings the Kronos Quartet back to town for
a set that should include Harrison's gorgeous, medieval-flavored String
Quartet Set, which has been in the Kronos repertoire since early 80's,
along with the local premiere of the organic and romantic Ghost Opera by
Chinese composer Tan Dun, which the group recently recorded."

Saturday 4/12, 8 pm Walker Art Center
Sunday 4/13, 3 pm Walker Art Center
Monday 4/14, 8 pm Ted Mann Concert Hall

I don't have any more specific information on pieces being played.  But
when I ordered tickets for the Kronos show I asked about the program for
that night.  There was a long list rattled off to me which I didn't write
down and didn't recognize the names of any pieces -- except Partch's Two
Studies in Ancient Greek Scales.  Obviously the program is not all
Harrison.  In any case, I'm looking forward to it!
