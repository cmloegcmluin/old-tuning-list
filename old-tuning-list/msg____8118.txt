Subject: barbershop singing

From: martin hatch <mfh2@cornell.edu>

I'd appreciate any leads on in-print CDs of barbershop singing that any of
you folks think are particularly good examples of singing in one tuning or
another. I'd like to try to analyse them on a pitch-tracking program I'm
working with.

Also, if you have the names of any other in-print CD recordings of
unaccompanied (by instruments) vocal music -- monophonic and polyphonic --
that you think are good examples of singing in one tuning or another, I'd
be grateful to hear about them.
Best,  Marty Hatch
