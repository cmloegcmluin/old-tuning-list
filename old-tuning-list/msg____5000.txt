Subject: tuning an M1 with software

From: Will Grant <wgrant@cats.ucsc.edu>

I can't speak specifically about the M1, but most synthesizers
can approximate only to within 3 cents of a pitch, sometimes as close
as 1.5 cents. That's adequate for most purposes, but it's not enough
if you want to generate beats, for example, from pitches .5 cents apart.

Sometimes pitchbend is more exact than fine tuning.

But it's a good idea to try out the equipment physically
with the things you want to do before buying it.

Faculty at UCSC might be able to find an M1 at Peter Elsea's studio,
if they wanted to try one out.


Will
