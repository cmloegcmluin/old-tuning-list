Subject: Question for Bill Alves ; book binge

From: Steven  Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov>

Bill,

I saw a bit ago that you have/will have a book, but I've lost the URL
that got me there.  I was quite intrigued by "Terrain of
Possibilities", which I picked up recently, and seeing as how I'm
about to go on a book binge I'd like to add your book to my list.

If I'm not mistakes, would you be kind as to point me to a source?

Also, if anyone has any suggestions for a thing or two to add, here's
my current shopping list:

	The above mentioned book
	Divisions of the Tetrachord
	New Music in 31 Notes (if it's still available?)
	Xenharmonikon 9, 12-current

I'm looking mostly for JI or middle-ET related works (e.g. 22, 31, 15,
and 27 are ones in which I have an interest, to a greater or lesser
degree, at the moment), as I've got ample access to things on
acoustics and instrument building.  Are Erv Wilsons works available in
a collection, or should I add XH1-6 to my list above?

I've already got Genesis, though now that it's back in print, maybe
I should buy a couple and hoard them until I find someone who'd
appreciate them as a gift (and mine's a bit dogearred... :)

Thanks,

Steve
