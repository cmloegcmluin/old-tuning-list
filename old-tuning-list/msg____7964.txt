Hi Bill:

YOu'll probably get a lot of response on this.  SOme of us 
have done pieces using Opcode MAX for microtuning 
for over five years.  You're right, one can bang 
BENDOUT values from lists or tables and make clean
new scales.  What device are you playing on?  Not all
will be as poly as you might want.
