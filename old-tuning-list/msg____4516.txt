   Dan is certainly correct here.  I think - again based upon my reasearch
- that a better phraseology would be "on a vastly, FAAAAAR smaller scale". 
But he's certainly correct that the effects of those imperfections aren't
COMPLETELY negligible.  

   And his point that they're much more prevalent in gut strings is
certainly astute and accurate.
