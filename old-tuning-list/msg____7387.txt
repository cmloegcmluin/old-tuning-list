Strangely enough, I find that I can agree with the responses
to this from both Gary Morrison and Johnny Reinhard.
System-building in music certainly goes a long way
towards satisfying one's intellectual proclivities, but
then in good performances, there always seems to
be room for expressive inflection.

The ultimate (and to me, surprising)  outcome of
the Hendrix Chord debate, for me, was that the
most intriguing interpretation of the chord was
that it is a *hybrid* of 12-ET and 7- (and/or
19-) limit just intonation.  This is clearly microtonal,
and it's precisely those small microtonal nuances
that come from bending the lowest  two notes to
approximate just ratios, and from having the
highest note a 12-equal ratio, which give the
chord the unique sound it has.  It certainly
sounds much more interesting played this
way than in straight 12-equal (although not
necessarily as interesting or consonant as
in any of the straight just-intonation versions).

By and large, my feeling about calling
the blues microtonal is that there is very little
actual harmonic movement -- the 12-equal scale
gives what I think is a good approximation of
a "tonic" (I) with its close Pythagorean relatives (IV
and V) -- but lots of exploration of higher-prime
identities within that restricted chord movement.
Even though the 12-equal "7th"  is between
29 and 33 cents sharper than the 7th harmonic
in all three chords, every chord in the blues
*always* has it, and to me, this reinforces the
idea that the 12-equal "7th" is intended by
blues musicians to be interpreted as the 7th
harmonic.  This is even more the case when
a good perfomer like Jimi compensates by
bending up other notes in the chord to make
the "7th" fit better.

Certainly, the guitar is a 12-eq instrument, but,
as Neil says, "there's micronotes galore because
of the bending and stretching that constantly goes on"
in the blues (I emphasize the word "constantly").

And don't forget --  the vocals are an integral part
of standard blues, and we know there's no
12-equal restriction there!  A great blues singer
like Robert Johnson or Louis Armstrong sings
notes that are all over the place, and between
all the cracks.  And when the techical ability
on the instrument is there, as it is in both Johnson
and Hendrix on the guitar or Armstrong on the
trumpet, the instrumental notes will be all over
the place too, quite closely related to what the
voice is doing.

Throughout musical history, the measure of a
great instrumental performer's ability  has been
how good he/she is at making the instrument "sing",
"wail", or "talk".  Note the reference to vocal
performance!  We can't always use the
construction of the instrument as a yardstick
when we're talking about such talented
performers.

To me, the blues is clearly a microtonal music,
the question is, how systematic are the
*just-intonation* implications that are buried
there in those notes?  In my opinion, 7 and 19
are definitely there.  What about 11, 13, and 17?
(I'm pretty sure I hear Robert Johnson singing
some 11s)  What about 23 and still higher primes?
