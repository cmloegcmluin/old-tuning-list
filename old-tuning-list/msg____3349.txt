Subject: The generating function

From: Mmcky@aol.com

Hello again Paule,

>Manuel's series are in fact infinite. You don't stop at

>functions need not be infinite.

Perhaps I haven't been paying enough attention here, 
so I went back and reread some of Manuel's posts, 
and I see that you have a point.

I do wonder why Manuel didn't just say that.  It 
appeared that he was trying to defend the idea that a 
finite collection of integers had only one generating 
function.
