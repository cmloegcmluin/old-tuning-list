Ben Neill will be the featured artist on the latest "Star's End Gathering"
on the campus of UPenn in Philadelphia:

                Star's End Gathering VI
                8:00pm Saturday, September 28th, 1996
                Houston Hall Auditorium
                3417 Spruce Street, Philadelphia
                Performing Live: *Ben Neill*

I'm sure you're aware of Ben's music from all the times I featured his CD:
"Green Machine" (Astralwerks) on Star's End. And/or you may have heard Ben
play at Cloudwatch down in Baltimore around that same time.

At The Gathering on September 28th Ben will be performing pieces from not
only "Green Machine" but from his brand new CD "Tryptical" (Antilles) which
is being released on September 10th, 1996. There's also a slide show
presented along with Ben's music.

Star's End is a "Space Music" radio program broadcasting out of WXPN in
Philly.  These Gatherings are a combination spacefest/benefit for the show.
The last one in late June featured Steve Roach.

Another JI artist, Robert Rich, is currently touring and will be playing one
of his "sleep concerts" at WXPN on Oct 12/13 along with a bunch of other
gigs on the east coast.  I'll put up a tour schedule on the list soon.  My
apologies to people in other areas for the regional focus.
