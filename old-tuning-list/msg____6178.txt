   At the risk of being presumptuous, I think I can probably speak for most
tuning enthusiasts when I say that you're far better off using 12 and 7
than 13 and 8.  In summary, you're asking for trouble when you count both
beginning and ending notes (e.g., both upper and lower Cs in a C scale)
when you also admit the possibility of repeating that pattern - using the
upper C as the root of that same scale in the next octave.

   Ideally fifths would have been called fourths, unisons called zeros,
octaves sevenths, thirds seconds, and so forth.  That would ensure that
intervals "add" correctly, like in the case of a fourth plus a third coming
out to a sixth.  Clearly 4+3=7 rather than 6.  If, historically speaking,
we had recognized the (perfect) unison as a pitch difference of zero (which
is after all exactly what it is) then fourths would have been called
thirds, thirds called seconds, and sixths called fifths, and the result
would have been correct:  3+2=5.

   But in the end our only option is to accept that the damage is done.  We
just use traditional interval nomenclatures as formal, conventional names,
and attribute only very limited numerical meaning to them.  Fourths,
thirds, and sixths are just names;  they could just as appropriately have
been called johns, sarahs, and franks.

   So the fact that the etymology of the word octave suggests the number 8
most of us view as largely inconsequential, because it really suggests 7
diatonic steps, or 12, 19, or whatever chromatic steps.
