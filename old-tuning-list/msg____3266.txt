Subject: theory book

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...please forgive me for doing a quick advertisement...
one of the folks on the forum (thanks, Steve) just bought my theory
book, the Form Of No Forms, so I wanted to let everyone know that it
is available ($20.00), and it has been endorsed (in personal letters)
by guitar greats Joe Pass and Tommy Tedesco. It IS a 12/eq book, and
it covers a wide range of music theory, from basic chords and scales
to advanced altered chords and polytonal substitutions...of course,
many of the ideas can be applied to other tuning systems...in fact,
I am using a lot of these concepts in my explorations of 19/eq. If
you want to brush up on your theory in 12 (gasp), this could be the
book for you. My address is: Box 150271, Lakewood, Colo., 80215...
also, still plenty of cassette copies of my CD, "The Gate" left,
featuring hot rod blues/rock in 19...only $5.00...perfect for stocking
stuffers foe the little microtonalist in your life...Hstick
