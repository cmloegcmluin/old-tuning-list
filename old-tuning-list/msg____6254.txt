Apparently you dot not attend many orchestral and chamber music concerts.
 Out-of-tune playing, even in professional ensembles, is painfully
common, in my experience.

Then why do you exclude 12ET music from AFMM?  And what do you consider
*not* microtonal?  Wouldn't it be more accurate to call it the "American
Festival of non-12ET Music" (the word "microtone" being redundant)?

Given the precision of your "yardstick", there isn't much 12ET music to
exclude, actually.  20th century organ music (and piano music, if you
consider a piano with stretched octaves still to be in 12ET) and
serialism come to mind, but I can't think of much else that has ever
actually been *performed* in 12ET to within 1 cent.  (Don't guitarists,
like violinists, normally tune the open strings pure?)
