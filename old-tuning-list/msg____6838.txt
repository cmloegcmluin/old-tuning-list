Subject: Top Ten

From: Carl Lumma <clumma@nni.com>

>>Post a list of yer top ten, I'll put it up on Juxtaposition Ezine.

This is NOT in order...

 1. CRI -> Harry Partch "Vol #1" (11 Intrusions & Others)
 2. CRI -> Harry Partch "Vol #3" (Dreamer & Others)
 3. Innova -> Harry Partch "Enclosure #4" (Delusion of the Fury video)
 4. Freenote Records -> Catler Bros. "Crash Landing"
 5. Neil Haverstick -> "Acoustic Stick"
 6. Nitelife -> "Basin Street Blues"
 7. Cedille -> Easley Blackwood "12 Microtonal Etudes"
 8. New Albion -> Michael Harrison "From Ancient Worlds"
 9. Flying Fish -> Other Music "Incidents out of Context"
10. Jules Siegel -> "New Experiences in Music"

Notes...

1-2. Composers Recordings Inc.
http://www.composersrecordings.com/partch.html

3. Or dub from LP in some Library.  I am suggesting that the copyright on
the audio-only recording of Delusion be blatantly violated.  Copyright is an
agreement made with the goal of getting a work distributed.  The publisher
has sole right to reproduce a work, *if* they will produce it.  Columbia
Sony is not doing this, although they will probably either start doing it,
or sell the rights to somebody who will soon, since there is a sizable
demand for this recording.

4. 13-limit tonality-diamond Jazz.
http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/catalog.htm

5. Music in 19 and 34 tone equal temperament.
Call: (303) 477-3268

6. Barbershop Quartet, SPEBSQSA 1996 International Champions.
http://www.harmonize.com/Nightlife/

7. All equal temperaments 13-24 notes/octave, plus Fanfare for 19-tone Equal
Tuning, and Suite for Guitar in 15-note Equal Tuning.
Call: (888)749-9998

8. Some of the best minimalism there is in any tuning.  Played on the
Harmonic Piano, an instrument of the composer's invention (24-tone 7-limit
Just).

9. Polyrhythmic good stuff in JI.

10. New age music in a 33 note/octave 13-limit Just tuning.  No longer
available.  Gary!  This spot is yours, if you'd only make an album!

>Did you ever hear the La Monte Young Forever
>Bad Blues Band "Just Stompin'" cd? I didn't get "it"
>until I heard them live. Woooah!

I tried to get this album from the JI Network store, but they said they
could no longer get it.
