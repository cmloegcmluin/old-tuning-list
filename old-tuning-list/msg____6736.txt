I vaguely recall something in Mersenne to this effect, back in the 17th
century; Euler used this principle also, I think, but maybe in a
different context. It certainly is one of the traditional methods of
evaluating consonance. It definitely has problems though, but perhaps
not insuperable problems. For example, 9:2 is certainly not consonant,
even though the product of its ratio members is less than that of 5:4
for example. But probably my comments are nothing new to you. I tried to
use this once, but could never reconcile my ears with the resulting
numbers. But there may be a way.
