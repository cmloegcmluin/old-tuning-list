Subject: Re: Lost post from Brian McLaren

From: bil@ccrma.Stanford.EDU (Bill Schottstaedt)

I started trying to respond to Brian's condemnation of
algorithmic composition, but the more I type, the more
I delete.  I don't think there's any great need to
pounce on composers for using words in a general way --
why not try to understand what problems they're dealing
with, rather than shouting about Science?  For example,
in my own case, I got interested in algorithmic composition
because it gave me a way to break out of a personal rut --
a freer form of improvisation if you will, and it was
for ten years a time of complete exhileration.  I would
run 50 or 100 algorithmic "takes" (mostly just tweaking
random number seeds), extract the stuff that caught my
ear, and goof around with that until a finished piece
of music emerged.  99% of the "work" was done by the
computer.  I wrote the algorithms and chose the output
I liked, so I call myself the composer.  The other source
of ideas was a similar kind of goofing around with 

sounds (synthesized or recorded); in either case, there
was a conscious effort to make mistakes -- that is,
the most fruitful compositional paths, in my case,
were opened up when I just blindly charged into something
without having any idea what I was doing.  After the fact,
I could make a sensible narrative to explain why that
path was a World-Historical Necessity.  So, I think Brian's
attacks are counter-productive, assuming any composer
is listening -- my advice is, pay no attention to the
experts!  Who cares what "experimental" means, or whether
the means were "valid" or whether an unaided human could have
done the same thing given 10 lifetimes?  In composition,
it's the result that count.
