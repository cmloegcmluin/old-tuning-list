Subject: Re: Numbers and a new tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Great to read of that all integers are sacred when they are small eough.
(There are 10 in a minyan, however, which is the necessary minimum amount
of Jewish participants for group prayer.)

I've been working on a new piece in a new tuning.  It is for soprano,
violin, viola, and cello and scheduled for performance at De Ysbreker on
October 13th in Amsterdam.  It is largely tuned to Harmonic-17.  

As some of you may recall, there have been some surprisingly good success
in composing in Harmonic-13 tuning (wherein each interval of a 14-note
scale is made up of ratios that contain either a 13 or a multiple of 13).

Well, now its Harmonic-17, wherein each interval in a 16-note scale is
made up of ratios that contain either a 17 or a multiple of 17.
Basically, the sound resonates in a unique fracture of the octave, sifting
easily into 3 and 4 note chords that resemble harmonic chordal progresson.
There are certainly exotics, too.  

I would suppose one would eventually discern a "17-ness" to the music.
There was earlier discussion of a feeling for certain limits of the
overtone series (e.g. 7-limit quality of sound, 11-limit quality of
sound).  I recall disagreement with this notion.  However, when every
single note is a 17-perspective, might the "-ness" resulting merely be a
manifestaion of the music's "17-ness"?
