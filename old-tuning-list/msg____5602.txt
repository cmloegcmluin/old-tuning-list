Subject: Tibetan Tuning

From: James Kukula <kukula@synopsys.com>

I suspect the Tibetan Tuning on the synthesizer is indeed about as Tibetan as
Mongolian BBQ is Mongolian, as hypothesized. I suspect the Tibetan Singing 
Bowl phenomenon is the link. I'm pretty sure those bowls were originally used
as offering bowls on shrines. I don't think there's any traditional Tibetan
musical use of such bowls.

I'm not so sure about Tibetan music being pentatonic though. I have roughly
zero musical training, but I did get taught some traditional Tibetan ritual
music. The only instrument I know of with any kind of real scale is the
gyaling, which is a kind of shawm, kind of like a bag-pipe except the bag is
one's mouth. I sure don't know how they're tuned. But I spend lots of time
playing semi-mindless pentatonic "melodies" on my guitar, and the gyaling
doesn't really seem to work like that at all.
