Subject: more 19

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...the summer is good for lots of extra gigs, such as
street fairs and mini festivals, and my band is playing 19 tone music
as a regular feature of our sets, and we're pulling it off. In fact,
the other musicians we play with are usually intrigued and interested
in our instruments, and the "average" fans may be a little confused,
but they are usually receptive. We do a real cross section of 19 tone
music, including jazz, reggae, blues, and country...as soon as we get
a 34 tone repertoire more together, we'll be doing that as well. People
all over Denver have heard of what we do, and usually in a positive way.
When I first started playing 19 tone 6 years ago, I never would have
dreamed that it would be so well accepted...Hstick
