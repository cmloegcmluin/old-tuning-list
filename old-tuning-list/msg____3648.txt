Subject: Pipedum

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

I regret having to announce that I encountered a serious bug in
command "pipedum" in Scala causing often a wrong result. This command
creates a JI scale from a set of independent defining intervals. So
don't use it unless you are able to verify the result. The next Scala 
version will have it fixed.
"Pipedum" comes from the Dutch word parallellepipedum, in English:
parallelepiped.
I was trying to create a scale with the diaschisma and kleisma as 
defining intervals and discovered it didn't have 34 notes as expected
(in 34-tET the diaschisma and kleisma vanish).
See also the posting of mine of 1 August 1995.
