Subject: Re: BACH'S TUNING

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Manuel recently posted from the harpsichord list several points of 
view on Bach's Tuning, one of which commented on Prof. Rudolf Rasch's 
opinion that J.S. Bach composed in equal temperament.

   I will quote part of my article *Bach's Tuning* from PITCH I:2 pp. 31-32
in reference to Rudolf Rasch's position on the equal temperament factor 
and Bach, a position with which I disagree:

   In a recently published essay, Rudolf Rasch of the Netherlands asks 
the question "Does 'Well-Tempered' mean 'Equal-Temperament'?"  Rasch 
defines qualification of a tunng in which all tonalities can be 
performed.  Rasch believes, however, that Bach's *The Well-Tempered 
Clavier* was conceived in equal temperament.  He attributes this to 
Werckmeister's later works which explicitly describe equal temperament.  
Werckmeister wrote in his *Hypomnemata musica* of 1697 that:
	Who, however, asks for a temperament in which all consonant 
	intervals are equal, must take care that all fifths beat 1/12th of a 	
	comma downward, so that all major thirds beat 2/3 of a comma and 
	the minor third 3/4 of a comma... So far I have not been able to 
	agree with this view, because I prefer to keep the diatonic notes 
	which are used most often with the diatonic tonalities, as pure as 
	possible in tuning.
   Werckmeister clearly does not fully support equal temperament at this 
point in his life.  Yet in Werckmeister's *Harmonologie musica* of 1702, 
Rasch has determined that there is "a direct pleading for equal 
temperament, based on the possibilities of unlimited transportation and 
enharmonic changes."  One problem with this interpretation is that all 
circular keyboard tunings are, by definition, capable of unlimited 
transposition and enharmonic changes.  In this sense, equal temperament 
fits well within the larger category of well-tempered tunings.
   Werckmeister's last opus *Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse* of 1707 
was published posthumously.  Based on Rasch's translated excerpts, it 
would appear to the point of offering an apology "for his earlier 
propaganda for unequal temperaments.
	Werckmeister's attitude at the end of his life is summarized in a 
	book published posthumously (1707) where in effect he apologized 
	for not having included equal temperament among the various 
	circulating temperaments for which he had earlier published a 
	monochord diagram.  (The incompetent engraver, he said, had 
	complained about dividing the narrow space of a comma into 12 parts.)  
	He quite approved of equal temperament, yet was willing "to have the 
	diatonic 3rds left somewhat purer than the other, less often used
	ones," a procedure for which he had expressed clear preference in his 
	earlier writings.
   What can be deduced for certain is that Werckmeister wrote about equal 
temperament usage with increasing frequency in his later years.  This 
need not be interpreted as a dogmatic insistence on equal temperament, 
nor as a preference, since Werckmeister was merely cataloging.

Manuel, please forward the above to the harpsichord list.  Thank you.
