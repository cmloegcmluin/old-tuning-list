This sounds like exactly what we've been looking for!  Get it to
work with full keyboard tunings -- using Scala files as input
would be the simplest way.

The additional memory requirements won't be that great, because
you don't need any new samples.  There may still be a problem
with the AWE32 because it has such a small RAM.

The program I want asks for a Sound Font file, a tuning file and
a destination bank.  It then copies every preset from bank 0 into
the new bank, and alters it to implement the tuning.  It sounds
like you've done the difficult work already.

When I posted a list on this thread before, I should have said
that it is prioritised.  I use all the tuning features on my
TX81Z, so it would be inconvenient to work with anything less.  It
would be nice to at least experiment with much higher precision,
but I don't expect it'll make much difference.  It's possible that
I might one day start writing in highly complex JI that requires
more than one transposed table to be used in a piece, but that's
very much in the future.
