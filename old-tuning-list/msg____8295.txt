Subject: important Forum CD update

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

Closer and closer...the liner notes/CD design info are now at the 
printer...good news. But, a small glitch...the disc containing liner 
notes from Sethares and Loffink did not work, so we could not get them on 
Marty's computer...guys, if you would send your liners directly to Marty 
Lambuth at  visims@aol.com, we're ready to finish the project and get it 
to the CD manufacturer...thanks for your patience, and again, this disc 
is unique and satisfying...
    Also, Jim Ratts is finishing the master DAT over the weekend...Jim  
has a very interesting project available, called "Those Fabulous '60's;" 
it's a cassette which takes you on a musical trip through the 
music/politics of the 1960's with snippets of hundreds of songs and 
sounds, including the voice of Richard Nixon in some very embarrasing 
moments. It loosely reminds me of the Firesign Theater in it's skewed 
humor. It took Jim about 200 hours of tape editing to assemble this 
project, and it's one of my favorite tapes to listen to. It's yours for 
the cost of a blank cassette and postage...if you're interested, contact 
Jim at   sratts@compuserve.com  It received a great review in the Gavin 
report recently, and is a real hoot...there it is, hope to have the CD 
out soon...Hstick
