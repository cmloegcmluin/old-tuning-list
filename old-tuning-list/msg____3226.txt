Subject: Authenticity and Partch recordings
--
In the British Harry Partch Society right now
there's a debate raging about just how "authentic"
recordings of Harry Partch's music should be.
That's of some interest to this forum, because
members of this forum are directly affected.
Dean Drummond won't let Johnny Reinhard
borrow or rent any of Partch's instruments
because Johnny used a DX-7 in a recording of
Partch's music instead of a chromelodeon.
Let me point out something, people--
This kind of attitude is going to kill Partch's
music dead as a steamrollered cockroach.
What we need are *more* performances of
partch, not *fewer* performances.  Dean 
Drummond and company need to wake up
and smell the latte.  Johnny Reinhard should
have access to every instrument Drummond
has.
Now, 1 of the performances about which members
of the British Harry Partch Society had
questions was a recording done by Ted
Mook and a professional singer.  This is the
first CD appearance of Partch's Li Po Songs,
and the first new recording in more than
half a century (to my knowledge).
I think it's fantastic that someone had the
time, the energy, and the dedication to record
Partch's Li Po Songs.  
So what if the recording doesn't sound like Harry
Partch?
Harry himself pointed out that he was far from
an ideal vocalist.  In places Harry's pitch wanders
as much as 20 to 30 cents from the target notes,
as Ted Mook has pointed out.  Partch was under
pressure when he made his recording, he didn't
have adequate time or opportunity to rehearse
and certainly didn't have access to the enormously
helpful digital pitch references we have today.
In short, Partch did the best he could at performing
his Li Po Songs on that old 78 rpm record, but 
Partch just wasn't a professional singer.
Ted Mook's project uses a professional singer,
and to my mind the results are neither better nor
worse than the original Partch recordings--they are
*different.*
So?
What's the problem?
Why shouldn't we have a bunch of *different* versions
of Partch's music?
Where's the harm in that, provided the pitches are
correct?
As long as the pitches are scrupulously retained and
Harry's music isn't edited, expanded or (ye gods!)
translated into 12-TET or some such abomination...
Why *not* rearrange Harry's music for other
instruments?
In particular, certain members of the British Harry
Partch Society have been up in arms about the
recent Kronos Quartet arrangement of Partch's
"Barstow" intoned by Ben Johnston.
This is just incomprehensible to me. 
What in the world is wrong with arranging Partch's 
music for different instruments?  After all, Dean
Drummond did exactly that when he arranged 
Partch's "Two Studies On Ancient Greek Scales"
for flute and zoomoozaphone.  To these old ears,
the results sounded wonderful.
For that matter, another arrangement of those
same pieces was done for just intonation guitar,
this time by John Schneider.  You can hear it
on the CD "Just West Coast."
It sounded just fine.
If *these* arrangements of Partch's music
weren't a problem, why should the Kronos 
Quartet's arrangement be a big deal?
The other issue here is that if we demand that
*all* performances of Partch's music be
done *only* on original Partch instruments,
then that's going to limit the performances
of Partch's music to just about nothing.
I mean, c'mon, people!  Dean Drummond adn
Danlee Mitchell are the only two people on
the planet who have Partch's instruments
in their possession.  So that means that
only two (count 'em, 2) people on the planet
can give concerts of Partch's music if we
insist on absolute fanatical authenticity
and *never* allow Partch's muisc to be
arranged for other instruments.
In particular, I see no problem at all with
the idea of using synthesizers for some of
Partch's music--as long as the synthesizers
produce creditable imitations of Partch's
instrumental timbres, and as long as the
synths are tuned to Partch's scale, and as
long as the parts are played correctly.
To insist that *only* instruments produced
by Partch himself be used in performances
would be to lock Partch's music away from
the public.
In my judgment, it's infinitely better for *lots*
of people to hear synth versions of Partch's
music, or string quartet versions of his
music, or a zoomoozaphone-and-flute version
of Partch's music, than for only a tiny few
people who live in upstate New York to hear
the Absolutely Authentic Real Thing.
Ideally, of course, there would be many copies of
Partch's instruments, plenty of Partch-trained
instrumentalists, and so on.  But we live in the
real world.
Given real-world constraints, isn't it better to
hear *more* of Partch's music in *more* venues,
than less?

Folks:

I agree whole-heartedly with Brian about access to Harry's music and
commented about that in a recent post about Kronos' recording. Some years ago
I began an "electronic" orchestration of the same work with Partch tuned MIDI
instruments and my own voices which emmulated Harry's timbres. About half way
through I thought I might get the blessing of Danlee Mitchell and rang him
up. His comments were that I was ignoring the "corporeal" visions Harry
had about performances- although I didn't agree with this in the case of
Barstow (I think I might agree in the case of some of the big pieces) I did
Danlee and Harry's memory the courtesy of terminating the project. After
hearing Ted Mook's recording and Ben's Barstow transcriptions-  now let's see
if I can find those old files!!!!

Cheers-
       Allen

Subject: Calculating the time it takes patterns to repeat in chords
Message-ID: <960712231529_433213215@emout18.mail.aol.com>

I want to thank Paul for comments on LCM.

His posts helped me to arrive at my present belief
that chords need to be normalized before their
LCMs represent the time it takes the pattern they make to
repeat.

Now that I have begun to get over the shock of getting a job
and moving to San Jose, I have some small amount of time
to devote to music again.

I have done the following computations for some chords with
low LCMs.  Because of having to do this in ASCII, I have
resorted to putting numbers at the head of the columns of
the table.  Below is the information on what the columns
of numbers mean.

1-3      Chord Periods Ratios
4        Normalization constant
         The LCM of all periods in all chords divided by
              the largest period in the chord
5-7      Normalized Chord Periods
8        Normalized Chord LCM
9        Un-normalized Chord LCM
10-12    Chord Frequency Ratios

Here is the table.
