Subject: RE: TUNING digest 773

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%Acadian@mcimail.com>

Perhaps the most interesting of the TUNING digests I have seen! (~100 of 
them).

On Henk Badings and Nazism, we can get all the Wagner CDs we want, and 
rightly so. I would hesitate to censor a Nazi's speeches, let alone his 
music. Every time I walk into a record store, I go directly to the section 
after Bach, only to find Baden followed by Baermann. The few selections of 
Badings I have heard have been breathtaking, and I haven't even heard his 
microtonal work. It would be a true loss to humanity if Badings' music were 
to disappear into the shadows of history, but it seems as if it already has. 
Any information on how to obtain LPs or cassettes of his music would be much 
appreciated!

The question of tuning a harmonica is a truly interesting one. Although 
meantone is the best possible tuning to get all six consonant triads in a 
diatonic scale, only three of these triads are possible on the diatonic 
harmonica (CEG, DFA, and GDB -- I believe there is a draw G in the lower 
register, isn't there?). So the intervals AC and EB do not need to be tuned 
precisely. If the presence of two different-sized whole tones is not 
disturbing to you, you can try 1/1 9/8 5/4 27/20 3/2 27/16 15/8 1/1. More 
radically, if you allow the draw G to be different from the blow G, you 
might want to try 1/1 10/9 5/4 4/3 (3/2 or 40/27) 5/3 50/27 2/1, where 3/2 
is the blow G and 40/27 is the draw G. The chromatic harmonica, as described 
by Pat, is a different beast, I'll have to think about it. It seems less 
restrictive in that G does not have to be in tune with D or B. But the 
problem of getting the dominant seventh chord to sound just without 
destroying the usual intervals seems futile. Equal temperament (of the 12 
variety) is a pretty good compromise here.

Which leads me to Harold Fortuin's post. While the 31-note scale has both 
beautiful diatonic scales and 4/5/6/7 chords, unfortunately the latter are 
not included in the former. The 4/5/6/7 chord appears as a German sixth 
(such as A-flat C E-flat F#) in the meantone interpretation of 31tet, and 
the minor version of this chord could be expressed as A-flat B D F#. These 
could fit into traditional harmony quite well, and their pure tuning would 
allow one to "sit" on them or resolve to them with auxilliary progressions 
before allowing them to perform their traditional function: A-flat and F# 
each resolve by a diatonic semitone to a G. The 11-limit intervals are quite 
good but do not show up in traditional harmonic formulae; incorporating them 
into traditional harmony would be a challenge, but certainly one of the most 
worthy challenges in music today.

Harold, I can tell you far more about the 22-tone scale, based on research I 
have done (soon to be published). Here 7-limit chords become the basic 
consonances and triads are incomplete. There are other similarities with 
jazz as well. I offer to send you a copy of my paper and other material in 
exchange for recordings of your music, both past and future. I will e-mail 
you to see if you agree to this offer. Other references would include 
Yasser's _Theory of Evolving Tonality_ and van Eck's _J. S. Bach's Critique 
of Pure Music_. Yasser shouldn't be taken too seriously, but my imagination 
was sparked more by this book than any other. van Eck incorporates more 
modern psychoacoustics than any of your references, and certainly deals with 
"traditional" harmony, though microtones are not really dealt with. In any 
case, good luck to you, I think your approach is among the most likely to 
meet with success in the future of music.

Thanks to all for the suggestions of xenharmonic vocal compositions. I am 
definitely going to check some of these out.
