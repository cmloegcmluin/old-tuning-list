Subject: Trills:  Which Note First

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

I'm pretty sure that rock guitarists (like me) start on the lower note
-- I'll scan through some Hendrix and see if I can find any examples.
Back to microtones, the other day I heard some rock with a lengthy
guitar "trill" where the two notes were a sub-minor third apart. This
happens when trying to do a major second trill with an open string and
the note on its second string. On a guitar with light strings and low
action, the player will not be able to achieve a well-articulated
pull-off from the upper note without bending it considerably.
