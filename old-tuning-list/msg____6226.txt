Subject: Administrivia for 1200

From: "David Madole" <madole@ella.mills.edu>

Hi Tuners,

Well, Digest 1200 and the tape swap seemed like a good opportunity for
me to throw in my two cents and produce another of the long awaited
"administrivia summaries" for the Tuning List.  I have also appended
the unsubscription info at the end.

The Tuning List has been averaging about 360 subscribers in recent months,
with domain distribution as follows (as of last Friday):

12 Canada, 1 South Africa, 1 Belgium, 10 Germany, 1 Sweden, 9
Non-Profit Organizations, 2 Singapore, 2 Switzerland, 1 Finland, 2 Hong
Kong, 18 United Kingdom, 1 US Military, 10 Netherlands, 1 Poland, 101
"Commercial", 1 India, 2 Norway, 4 Japan, 2 Brazil, 4 France, 1 Greece,
1 Korea, 3 Spain, 2 United States, 3 Austria, 41 "Net", 1 Guatemala, 3
Italy, 21 Australia, 97 US Education, 1 Yugoslavia, 2 US Government, 1
Uruguay.

The portion of US Education continues to become less predominant.  I think
this is a good sign.

As of today 7006 messages have been sent.  The archives contain 26 Meg
of information, with another 21 Meg or so on the related ftp site (some
redundancy - the first 499 Digests are available on the ftp site as well as
with the GET command, but we decided we could no longer support the
redundancy).

The Tuning List was started on February 1, 1994 by Greg Higgs and Dave
Madole at Mills College (Greg went on to save whales and is no longer
around).  It is supported by the staff at the Mills College Center for
Contemporary Music (plug! you can check out our web site at
www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/CCM.homepage.html) and with the resources of
Mills College.  Mills is located in Oakland, California, USA (near San
Francisco).

to unsubscribe from the tuning list send a message containing ONLY:

unsubscribe tuning

(No Subject: first line blank - no other content)

to

listproc@mills.edu

If you have trouble it MAY be because you are not trying to unsubscribe from
the same path you subscribed from - if so then send me mail related to
unsubscribing from tuning (I get a LOT of mail - up to 100 pieces a day -
often including messages to other lists that I am on from people having
trouble unsubscribing to them).

Most people have trouble unsubscribing either for the reason above or
because they are sending the unsubscribe message with something
relevant to the list processor in the Subject:, e.g., "unsubscribe
me".  The list processor (almost all of them) automatically rejects
such messages to avoid mail loops, especially with peer list
processors.  To disable "suspicious subjects" is paramount foolishness,
and most people can figure out the message.  If your mailer automatically
inserts subjects, then complain to your mail administrator.  Do not
just use "r" to respond to the rejection message because then you are
in one of those mail loops (qed).
