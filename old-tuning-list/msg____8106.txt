No Mac, I'm afraid.  Is there a PC equivalent?

Totally agreed with John Loffink's reply to this  - there has been 
progress, and there will be more.

Exactly. And we need to talk to _both_.   Anyone on good terms with a
programmer at Roland?

Lets get _rid_ of the pain.

I'm not sure I undertood this correctly, or whether it's 
(remotely?) true for all samplers.

OK.

Good point.  I'll start looking.  Anybody have JASA on CD-ROM?

(example snipped)

Thanks for the example - perfectly clear.

Gary, this won't answer you question, but maybe its of use.

When I first looking to put my studio together (1989-91) the TG77 was 
at one time top of my list.  In the end, I didn't buy it because I 
was interested almost entirely  in simulating acoustic instrs in 
microtones, and for what I wanted the S770/ S750 blew the TG out of 
the water.  The other drawback I found with the TG was that sounds on 
their own were fine, but when mixed together they never seemed to 
retain individuality (even through a desk etc).  But I never owned 
the TG.   A while later (1992?) an electroacoustic composer friend  
bought a K2000 - which is hugely more powerful and sonically superior 
to the TG. To my ear the K2000 still didn't match the Roland in sheer 
audio quality, but its programmability is indeed VAST.  Of course 
there's major differences in price between these beasts (the TG 
should be dirt cheap now(?) while a s/h K2000 may still be pricey).   
  
Gary again:

I agree with this, but I would still like (ideally) to see a better
resolution than 1 cent.   0.1 cents seems ideal, although (a) I can 
understand others wanting better resolution (b) I can understand 
others being perfectly content with 2 cent resolution. My guess is we 
need to strike a realistic compromise.  Personally, I think that 
compromise ought to be something in the region of 0.5 to 0.1 cents.  

Commas:

I wrote (re syntonic comma):

Yes, of course, there are those commas too. (I did mean the 
syntonic comma).   But maybe that begs the question.

Interesting, thanks.

Paul, I'll send you some stuff on consistency shortly (too long for 
the list) which will answer your questions.  I only meant (above) 
that consistency of ETs is based on comparing combinations of nearest 
approximations to JI intervals in n-ET to the nearest approximation 
of its JI combinatory eqivalent. The 'construction' of a comma has 
some similarity: eg., whether the combinations of 3 5/4s are 
equlvalent to an octave (etc).   But, obviously, there's more than 
this in consistency.

Great, that's perfectly clear.  Thanks.
