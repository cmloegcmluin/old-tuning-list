I call it powerful because it gets a lot done with only 12 pitches.  There
is a difference between consonance and utility.  12et's intervals aren't
very consonant, but they do provide a huge musical framework for being only
12 (providing 144 of Partch's "senses").

What?

Here's your problem!  You are using the Random House Dictionary and New
Harvard Dictionary of Music as references.  Consonance is not a factor of
the mind, it is an acoustic phenomenon having to do with the superposition
of waveforms.  Make the perception of this phenomenon as subjective as you like.

>>An interval 16 cents flat of the sublime 6/5 has frequency ratio
>>19723/16585.  This, of course, is our quite dissonant 12et minor third.

>So, 6/5 is sublime, and 19723/16585 is quite dissonant, yet powerful.

I did not call any interval in 12 equal powerful.  I called the tuning
powerful.  If you listen to the 300 cent third, you can hear it beat.  This
is dissonance.

>>An interval 18 cents flat of the 6/5 bears ratio 19/16.  It is a very
>>consonant minor third found in the duple 16-32 of the harmonic series...

>And 19/16 is very consonant.

It seems this comment was designed to make fun of me, based on your
Random-House-school-of-Cognitive-Psychology definition of consonance.  If
consonance is so subjective, why don't you offer a description of the 19/16?
What's that?  You've never heard it?

>Colleagues of the tuning list, the evidence suggests that musical beauty
>is in the ear of the hearer.

All forms of beauty are subjective.  That this is so, I think, is beautiful.

>I see many claims that low integer ratios produce more "natural" and
"perfect" >harmonies, but little proof that people actually respond this way.

The fact that you've heard many claims seems to suggest that people respond
that way.  For more evidence, check out Arthur Benade's "Special
Relationships" study, written up in his book "The Fundamentals of Musical
Acoustics" and in Doty's excellent "Just Intonation Primer".

Or you could do your own study.  I've done demos with over 15 people and
have yet to find someone who doesn't prefer his subjective experience of
Just Intervals.

Or you might ask why a capella choirs sing in Just Intonation.  You can't
get any more direct a measure of how humans like their sound than how they
tend to use their voices in a group.

>This makes the tuning list sometimes read like some medieval treatise on
the >nature of God.  Why be amazed then, that the Devil incarnate, 12TET,
wields >such power?

I don't know who we've got on this thing, but I thought it was more than
numerologists.  There's nothing inherently good about the low integers.
Tuning to them only makes sense because they occur in the timbres of most
acoustic instruments.  If you have an instrument (like the Hammond Organ)
that produces tempered harmonics, then it would be a mistake to tune it in
Just Intonation (it's also impossible to re-tune tonewheel organs).

As for my use of "amazed", you've probably got me.  I'm actually amazed at
how such beautiful patterns can come out of almost any tuning, Just or not.
That's why I got into Xenharmonics.  Not because I was on a numerological
crusade, but because tuning can be one of the most powerful resources for
musicians.
