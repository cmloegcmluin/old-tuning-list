Did I really argue that way? I thought my reasons for sometimes giving 9
a separate direction had nothing to do with saturated chords. Although I
may have used a saturated chord as an example of a 9-limit harmony.

I would have to disagree with the way you drew those pictures. The
3-limit connection between 3 and 9 is very important, so I would include
an additional 9 to the right of 3 in both chords. As I have said before,
the disadvantage of giving composites their own axes is that certain
notes often have to appear in more than one place in the lattice.

True.

>A lattice that treats 9 as prime can't show that.

Unless you put 9 in two places.

In all of his diagrams that I've seen, 9 is NOT a separate axis.

I'm confused.

Something along those lines might be the best solution, although (I'm
assuming you have invisible lines connecting 7 to the other identities)
I would still want to have 9 directly connected to 5 and to 7. The
advantage of giving 9 its own axis is that such connections can be
easily made without a messy tangle of lines.

Right, one where the two occurences of 9 would coincide due to the
curvature.
