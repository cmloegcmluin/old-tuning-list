****MAX COURSE AT THE LANDESMUSIKAKADEMIE NRW****

***********INTERACTIVE MUSIC SYSTEMS***********

(includes class on microtonality)

Professor: Georg Hajdu, Germany

Description:
Musicians using electronic media in their work tend to find themselves
in a dilemma. On one hand, the functions of sequencer programs -
although they have become quite efficient - are too fixed; on the other
hand, complicated programming languages can cause considerable problems when
musicians try to program specific applications themselves.This difficulty is
overcome by the graphical programming environment MAX (named after Max
Mathews, the pioneer of computer music). Its great potential, which lies
in enabling the user to create programs without having to write code,
has made it a sort of "lingua franca" in computer music.

Though initially written for musical applications, MAX is a complete
multi media system mastering functions like film, animation, CD-ROM
control etc. thus permitting the combination of music, graphics and
text. Recently, the development of MSP (MAX Signal Processing) has added
powerful audio functions which make it possible to use a PowerMacintosh
computer as synthesizer or sampler without further hardware. The number
of possible applications is almost unlimited: concerts, museums,
installations and teaching aids are just some fields where MAX is
employed increasingly and successfully.
