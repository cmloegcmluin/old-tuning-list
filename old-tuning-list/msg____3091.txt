Subject: Ancient Greek Modes

From: bg@afm.org

Greetings all!

        As I just joined this list, I don't know if this topic has been 
explored extensively or not, but I'll ask anyway.

        Does anyone have any specific recommendations for books dealing 
with Ancient Greek modes, and information on said books availability?  
Specifically, I would like to get a copy of Schlesinger's _The Greek 
Aulos_, if anyone wants to part with a copy.  I heard, I can't remember 
>from whom, that the book is rather looked down upon in academic circles, 
but I was never told why.  Are there more up-to-date studies in english? 
Needless to say, any book that describes the modes by the equal tempered 
scale seems hardly worth consideration.

        Thanks to all for your help.  I'm looking forward to meeting you 
all in the 'virtual garden of disclosure'. 

        Regards,
            Ben
