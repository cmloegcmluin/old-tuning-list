Hello, there, and I guess that such a tuning might look like this:

     15:14     189:160            10:7     45:28     567:320
    119.44     288.38            617.49   821.40     990.33  
      c#'        eb'               f#'      g#'        bb'
 _119.4|84.5_84.5|119.4_     _119.4|84.5_119.4|84.5_84.5|119.4_    
 c'         d'         e'    f'         g'         a'         b'   c''
1:1        9:8       81:64  4:3        3:2       27:16   243:128  2:1
 0        203.91    407.82 498.04    701.96     905.87   1109.78 1200
    203.91     203.91    90.22   203.91    203.91   203.91    90.22

Here are some quick comments, hoping that the above interpretation of
your scheme is (at least mostly) right.

The idea of leaving the Pythagorean whole-tones (9:8) and diatonic
semitones at e-f and b-c' (256:243) unaltered, but changing the
divisions of the whole-tones into semitones, occurs in some medieval
and Renaissance sources. 

However, these schemes tend either to minimize the contrast between
the usual Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic semitones -- around 90.22
cents and 113.69 cents -- or indeed to make them precisely equal. A
14th-century organ-pipe plan dividing the tone by pipe ratios of
18:17:16 (roughly 99.95 cents-104.96 cents), and the scheme of
Henricus Grammateus (1518) to achieve a true equal division of the 9:8
tone by Euclidean methods (about 101.955 cents) are examples.

In contrast, your scheme slightly accentuates the difference between
the diatonic and chromatic semitones, respectively 21:20 (about 84.5
cents) and 15:14 (about 119.4 cents). Apart from adding a bit of extra
contrast, this tuning has the advantage of not drastically
compromising the fifths Bb-F and B-F#' in the way that either the
18:17:16 or Grammateus tunings do, making one or both intervals more
than 10 cents from a just 3:2. The actual compromise of 5.76 cents or
so, a bit less than 1/4 Pythagorean comma, should be much less
disadvantageous.

Your arrangement has the interesting property of producing augmented
fourths and diminished fifths of precisely 10:7 and 7:5.

Another consequence, quite consonant (pun intended) with the desire of
Marchettus of Padua (1318) for _very_ wide cadential major thirds and
sixths (and narrow cadential semitones), is to make these intervals
about 5.76 cents larger than usual Pythagorean size when they involve
accidentals (e.g. e-g#, eb-c'). In these cadences M6 is 320:189, or
about 911.62 cents, while M3 is 80:63, or about 413.58 cents.

These last intervals, interestingly, vary from 5:3 and 5:4 by a
septimal comma (64:63), a neat 7-limit connection. Again, the tuning
stays fairly close to Pythagorean but tends to give it a bit of an
extra edge.

Having shared these first impressions, please let me return to some of
your other comments.

This sounds like an excellent point: "highest" or "greatest" or
"largest" prime indeed seems clearer to me.

>> the septimal minor seventh (7:4) also becomes literally and

> Figuratively?  How do you mean?

What I meant was a kind of play on words: in such a tuning, 7:4 is a
"prime factor" not only in the mathematical sense of 7 being a prime,
but in the figurative sense of being a "principal" or "very important"
factor in defining the scale and some of the possible sonorities.

Thank you again both for your helpful suggestions on my review of
articles by Paul Erlich and Brian McLaren in XH 17, and for your
intriguing scale -- hoping I got it mostly right.

Most appreciatively,
