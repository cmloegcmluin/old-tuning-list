That presumes a certain conceptual leap that the Greeks never took.

This was exactly by point. Aristoxenos _heard_ twelve equal parts to the 
octave. Neither he nor his contemporaries knew how to describe what he heard 
in mathematical terms. But considering the close agreement between 
Pythagorean tuning and 12-tet, it seems fair to say that Aristoxenus was 
hearing logarithmically. The octave divided into twelve parts arithmetically 
or harmonically gets you really horrible "Pythagorean" modes, and the fact 
that later theorists tried to interpret Aristoxenus this way shows that the 
proscription against irrationals was still strongly influencing scientific 
thought.
