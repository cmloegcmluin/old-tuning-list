   I agree about half-way with Gregg here.  I agree in that I have found
that melody maintains its recognizability through what might seem on the
surface to be extreme manipulation.  That fact is also born out by melodic
variation and inversion.  To that end I have found that differences in
12-toned temperaments, or even 5-limit diatonic JI, produce effects that
are subtle in comparison to the full gamut of new-tuning possibilities.

   So, speaking for my own personal new-tuning interests, I find the more
radically nontraditional tunings to be much more interesting.  Tunings that
have no recognizable representation of a major scale, for example, seem to
me to provide vastly more exciting possibilities.  Of course that's a
matter of personal opinion and interpretation.

   Now, speaking of interpretations, I interpret Gregg to say that
differences in 12-toned diatonic tunings, such as would occur between
12TET, a Werckmeister well temperament, QC meantone, and Ptolemaic JI to be
(realistically speaking) so subtle as to be musically insignificant.  I
definitely can't agree with that.  They are more subtle than, oh ...
quartertones for example, but I have performed or participated in many
studies of one sort or another to show that those subtle differences are
indeed musically interesting.  One example is the comparison of JI and
LucyTuning I described to you tuning listers something like a couple years
ago.

   There is also another very important counterexample to Gregg's belief
here, again assuming that I understood it correctly.  That counterexample
is microtonal steps - e.g., 41sts of an octave, in a melody.  Clearly a
melody that uses melodic steps smaller than Gregg's 60-cent limen can't
possibly be rendered faithfully in a tuning with 12 tones per octave.  If
anybody doesn't buy that, I recommend picking up a copy of Neil
Haverstick's new CD.  It has plenty of examples of great melodies whose
meaning and even recognizability would be significantly impaired by
attempting them in 12's comparatively crude tuning resolution.
