This is another case of confusing the modes of resonance with the
spectrum of an actual tone. The former is not a harmonic series but
depends on the shape of the instrument. Good brass makers sacrifice the
first resonance so that the others can come close to a harmonic series.
Still, the lowest resonances are typically dozens of cents off a
harmonic series. But the tone itself contains exactly harmonic partials.
If you don't believe me, read Dave HIll's recent post, where he found
that brass partials are a fraction of a cent off of harmonic, which is
far less than the dozen cent type errors in the lowest modes of
resonance. Even if you don't believe that Dave Hill's methodology led to
the errors of a fraction of a cent, clearly the modes of resonance and
the spectrum of a played tone are clearly two different things.

The reason the "fundamental," or more precisely the lowest resonant
mode, isn't used by horn players is that none of its harmonic overtones
coincide with resonances of the instrument. Hence mode-locking can't
occur, and a steady tone can't be produced, let alone one with a nice
timbre. A different, quiet "fundamental" can, however, be played by a
skilled lipper, which is of the "subharmonic" variety: The harmonic
overtones are engaging the resonances of the instrument, keeping the
lips vibrating in a steady pattern, while the fundamental is far from
the lowest resonance and is only weakly amplified at best.
