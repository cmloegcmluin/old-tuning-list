   Yes.  You describe any sequence of intervals between any group of keys,
and it will duplicate that sequence of intervals across successive keys.

   This probably isn't a particularly useful example, but you can, for
example set up this sequence of pitch relationships:

C4
     50c
C#4
     40c
D4
     30c
D#4

And then tell it to extrapolate from C4 to D#4, and you'll end up with:
..
A3
     50c
A#3
     40c
B3
     30c
C4
     50c
C#4
     40c
D4
     30c
D#4
     50c
E4
     40c
F4
     30c
F#4
