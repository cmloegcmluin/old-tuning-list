Subject: more Partch comments

From: bq912@freenet.uchsc.edu (Neil G. Haverstick)

Haverstick here...just a brief addition to the Partch comments which
have been on the forum lately...I don't have a clue why Partch should
be treated any differently than any other composer...am I missing
something here? Also, I just want to say that elitism in the arts is
really stinky, and has no place in the true artists life...music comes
from sound, and many of the great spiritual traditions state that sound
is a foundation of the very Universe...therefore, music belongs to
everyone, and indeed is part of everyone at the deepest level. I feel
musical talent is a wonderful gift, and is meant to be shared with as
many people as possible...many great artists have stated, at times,
that they feel as if their music is coming from somewhere else, that they
are not really DOING it, but they are only the vehicle for some higher
power...of course, I feel that is absolutely true, and I myself have had
the experience of seeing an idea come to me from beyond my teensy "self";
how, then, can it be "mine"? If it was given freely, then I feel it
should be shared freely as well...again, any whiff of elitism is wrong,
and has my utmost contempt...Hstick
