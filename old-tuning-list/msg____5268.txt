   I'd wager that they're also xdifferent diameters too.  This is a bit of
an oversimplification, but the larger a tonehole is, the more it behaves
like cutting the tube off entirely.  A small tonehole lets the vibration
extend farther down the tube than a larger tonehole, thereby making the
pitch flatter.

   That is true.  Theobald Boehm, the inventor of the modern flute, in his
book as translated and extensively commented by Dayton C. Miller (Dover
publication, if still available), characterized the placement of flute
toneholes as like frets on a string, but - essentially - with the
embouchure hole closer to the end of the tube than the bridge of the string
would be.

   Back when I was in high school, I did a science fair project to study
flute acoustics and thereby design and build 10TET flutes.  In that
investigation, I found that that prescription really didn't work.  The
toneholes ended up having to be spread out farther apart than that.

   The easiest way to place holes on a woodwind, I think I've concluded, is
to make a test instrument with essentially arbitrarily-placed holes, play a
scale up the tube precisely measuring the pitch of each hole.  You can then
plot those as distance/pitch pairs to form a "calibration curve".  That is
to say, you can connect the dots and smooth the curve to make it
continuous, and then use that curve to run the process backward:  Look up
from the calibration curve, the lengths that match whatever pitches you
want, and then build an instrument of otherwise identical dimensions, with
holes where you looked them up on the curve.
