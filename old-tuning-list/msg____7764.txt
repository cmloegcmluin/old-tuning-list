Well, I should hope it is--I derived my diagram from the frequencies
Bill posted to this list.

(Just for clarity's sake, Bill's scale is _not_ the same as the
following.)

This seems to have been a bit garbled in transmission--John, I assume
you mean for the second scale to look like this (are you using a
fixed-width font?):

 *   *   *

 *   *   *   *

     *   *   *

         *   *

Marion posted these to the list some time back, as I recall.
