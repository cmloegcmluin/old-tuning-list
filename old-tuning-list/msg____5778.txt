   Almost certainly that was the most basic reason.

   In terms of required resources that makes sense, but not in terms
of
actual usage to the best of my knowledge.  Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I
know of no evidence that meantone was never actually used in any
appreciable abundance in the Classical Era or later.

I would be interested to learn about the use of meantone in any Era.

Whatever tuning schemes were used, Equal Temperament "proved" better.
 At any rate, that is what pianos are tuned to,and most all keyboards
today.  When ET was first used for tuning, (and I assume it was on
pianos other wise it would have been on harpsichrods, or even earlier
on organs) that is an interesting question. (My guess is after 1850) 
We know that ET is based on the 12th root of 2.  
When that formula came into being and by whom I would like to know.
The other question is could Equal Temperament exist without knowledge
of the 12th root of 2 formula??  I think so, but that is for another
post.  
	Regarding the 12th root of 2, it doesn't mean much if you don't know
the frequency of the note.  When did it become possible to measure
the frequency of a musical pitch?  The frequency of pitch also allows
determination of harmonics.  Harmonics is what produces the beats (or
lack of) by which any instrument is tuned, especially when tuning by
intervals such as the fifth, fourth, third, octave and so on. But one
doens't need to know frequencies or math formulas to hear beats
resulting from tuned intervals. 
	The schemes for tuning intervals on the keyboard is interesting,
however after tuning pure fifths it soon becomes  apparent that one
fifth will be "wild" (and consequently its fourth). (and only one
fifth which is interesting)  Because of  this one lone "wolf" we have
the conecpt of temperament. Keep in mind this is a phenomona of
keyboards of 12 semitones to the octaves.  Orchesterial and choral
performances don't seem to be encumbered by temperament.
