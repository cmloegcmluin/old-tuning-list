I'm jumping into this conversation in mid-course, so I may well be
missing the context.  If so, my apologies.

"ergo, the distinction between C# and Db makes sense
_only_ in well temperament. But of course, you can't
set two different temperaments at once, at least not
on a piano.

   Welll...  

   Certainly C# and Db are different in meantone temperaments and just
intonation as well as in well temperaments.  And also in 17TET, 19TET and
31TET as well.

   But even if they are tuned exactly the same as they are in 12TET or
24TET, the two notes are functionally different.  C# is nominally the
leading tone in the key of D, and Db ... well, Db could be a number of
formulations, like the seventh of a dominant seventh in the key of Ab, or
the root of a Neapolitan in C.  

   Certainly those keys are not extremely closely related, so the reasons
why C# and Db should be identical (or bear any particular relationship to
one another), are fairly complex.  A tritone substitution, however, can get
you from D to Ab in a flash, so that's probably the most direct
relationship between the two.
