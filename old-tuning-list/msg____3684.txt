This noticed looked as if it might be of interest to Tuning
listers in the NY-NJ area, so with Trish's permission, I'm 
forwarding it.

             MUSIC AND MATHEMATICS

             Saturday October 26th


The Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science and the Center for
Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science will
present a one-day course on Mathematical Music Theory.  It will
be given by Guerino Mazzola, from the University of Zurich,
who is acknowledged as one of the worlds leading authorities
in this field.  Mazzola's book "The Geometry of Tones,"
(Birkhauser Press) was recognized immediately as a major advance
in our understanding of music. It is a complex argument
involving several theorems as well as analyses of works such
as Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata.

In addition, Mazzola has created powerful computer software
for analysis and performance of music - that is available
on the Internet.  Also, Mazzola's composition sequencer
software was recommended for commercial production by
Herbert von Karajan.

Besides being an advanced mathematician and computer
scientist, Mazzola is a frequently recorded jazz musician
with a discography of several albums and CD's.  He will
be visiting the United States this October to cut another CD.

The Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science and the Center for
Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science is sponsoring
a day-long course on Mathematical Music Theory from Mazzola.
Besides his lectures, Mazzola will demonstrate the remarkable
music composition and analysis software called RUBATO.
This is a great opportunity to meet and talk with this
remarkable person.

The course is free to all members of the public.

TITLE:
Theory and Hypermedia for Big Science in Musicology

ABSTRACT:
Based on modern information technology, mathematics and semiotics,
SYSTEMATIC MUSICOLOGY has fundamentally changed. As a theoretical
basis of this change, mathematical music theory offers a precise
language and models to describe  musicological facts. It is based
on three factors (1) symmetry, (2) local-global gestalts and
(3) the Yoneda classification by "variation of perspectives".
Hypermedia implementation of the theory is an integral
part of these significant developments. It turns out that
the representation and control of music's inhomogeneous and
semantically open data, make music a prototypical research
subject asking for Big Science effort and funding in the Humanities.

We explain these developments by presenting the theory, and the
computer analysis and performance platform, RUBATO(R), that has been
developed at the Multimedia Lab of Zurich University. RUBATO consists
of (1) a framework software, (2) three modules for rhythmical, melodic,
and harmonic analysis, (3) one module for shaping performances, and
(4) one module for sight-reading, (5) five modules for creating
performances. RUBATO is not only  an powerful research tool,
its concepts and architectural constructs yield fundamental insight
into the rational bases of performance. We report, for example,
on the highly significant relations between RUBATO's analyses
of Schumann's Kinderszene Nr.7 "Traeumerei" and the timings of
famous pianists. Comparison of Argerich's and Horowitz' recordings
on the basis of RUBATO's genealogical performance model yield new
approaches to comparative criticism.

Our talk includes video and audio tapes/CD to illustate the software.


Time:  Saturday Oct 26th,
       10am-5pm with breaks to meet other attendees
       and exchange information on music composition,
       performance, music software, etc.

Location: Voorhees Hall, Room 105
          College Ave Campus, New Brunswick.
          Voorhees Hall is within easy walking distance
          from the New Brunswick Railway Station.
          It can also be easily reached from the main
          New Jersey freeways, such as the NJ Turnpike.
