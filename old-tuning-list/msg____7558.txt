Subject: Radio Program

From: Didier ASCHOUR <daschour@teaser.fr>

Yesterday on Primitive FM (radio in Reims area) I had a one hour show in
which I programed:
Harry Partch: Rotate the body of all its Planes
Dan Stearns: Opus Contra Naturam
Catler Bros: Crash Landing
Jacques Dudon: Hexagrammes

I'll have this radio show almost every month, so if Tuning Listers wants to
send me some music they are welcome...
