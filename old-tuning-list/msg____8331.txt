Subject: Re: Numbers and a new tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@IDT.NET>

Thanks to both Pauls for studying my projected tuning intended for an ever
impending deadline for a new composition - called "Trespass."

Thanks to Didier for pointing out that the last note of the Harmonic-17
scale is 32/17 (not 34/17).  And I should have 18/17 (instead of my
dyslexic 17/18).

Paul Hahn is right to point out a Perfect Fifth from 17/10, but I hadn't
included this interval in my original list, though it is certainly implied
by my 20/17.  Are there other intervals that _scream_ to be included?
