American Festival of Microtonal Music 
Day #3: "Ear Garden" 
Columbia University's St. Paul's Chapel 
New York, N.Y. May 22, 1997

Ear Garden opened with the minimalist classic "In C" by 
Terry Riley. This version was performed using instruments 
that are plucked: guitar, viola, harpsichord and kanon 
(zither). At times the music seemed bathed in the 
reverberant space of St. Paul's chapel, at other times, 
the room was heard more then the instruments. Probably 
the best seat in the house would be on your back, on 
the floor at the feet of the performers. The performance 
was beautiful, the effect of the chapel was nice, but it
obscured the best efforts of the performers. 

"In C in Just Intonation" was premered by the AFMM in 1988. 

just intonation guitars - John Schneider and Wim Hoogewerf 
kanon - Skip LaPlante 
harpsichord - Rebecca Pechefsky 
viola - Anastasia Solberg 
pulse guitar - Steve Antonelli 

Luc Marcel's Beach Glass microtonalness came from 
harmonics and multiphonics on the bassoon and glissando's 
on the strings. After the quiet moments of In C, Beach 
Glass was almost deafening. In fact maybe
the strings over powered the bassoon. There was some 
fellow standing between the bassoonist and I, waving 
his arms about. Perhaps if I had a
better seat, I would have heard the performance better. 

conductor - Charles Zacharie Bornstein 
bassoon - Johnny Reinhard 
violin - Tom Chiu 
viola - Anastasia Solberg 
cello - David Eggar 

Enbellie by Iannis Xenakis for solo viola was characteristic 
of the composer's music. In fact, this version was more 
expressive then any I've heard before. Lot of hard bowing 
close to the bridge gave a dry tone where the tortured 
harmonics jumped out. A tortured lull in the storm?
Alternately then, quiet high notes. My references inform 
me that this is quartertone tuning. 

viola - Anastasia Solberg 

Sophia Gubaidulina's Duo Sonata for 2 Bassoons showed 
what a pair of bassoons can do. Quartertones, harmonic 
tunings and multiphonics. Quite the opportunity for circular 
breathing and the chords between the two horns were 
heavenly. I don't think I've heard anything like it.
Gubaidulina's music never fails to surprise. 

bassoons - Frank Morelli and Johnny Reinhard 

                                                         

Johnny Reinhard's Odysseus Cello Concerto had it all. 
Odyssus (David Eggar) and his soldiers wandered around 
St. Paul's chapel for 30 to 40 min. During their travels they 
discovered islands and strange beautiful instruments 
in different tunings: polymicrotonality, Reinhard's term for
using more then one tuning. 

     Where else can you see microtonalist guitarists John Schneider and
     Wim Hoogewerf kill a trombonist (Julie Josephson) with their
     guitars, tear off chunks and eat them? They offered some to
     Odysseus who politely refused with a shake of his head and a wave
     of the hand. 

     Lotus Eater Island (blown winds) was in one balcony while Aiolius
     (bagpipes) was in another. 

     Odysseus traveled to and from the underworld by sliding on his
     back across the floor under the piano. 

     At one point, Odysseus played some walking bass while his band of
     soldiers improvised some swinging microtonal jazz. 

     Two Sirens (Carol Flamm, Piera F. Paine) magically appeared in
     the pulpit and sang while a third (Christine Coppola) danced a
     wildly seductive dace to lure Odysseus. 

     No doubt Scylla and Charibdis (Jon Catler, just intonation guitar
     and Eric Ross, therermin) scared Odysseus and his gang half to
     death. What a racket! 

     There were many custom and/or rarely used instruments like 96
     tone equal temperament harp, shofar, psalteries, just intonation
     pedal steel guitar, large glass bowl in G, bansuri and shakuhachi
     flutes, ocarina, bagpipes, tarogato, theremin, and conch shells.

My picks: Enbellie, Duo Sonata for Two Bassoons and Odysseus. 

Stay tuned for more...
