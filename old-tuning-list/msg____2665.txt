There are program notes in the booklet accompanying
the Chowning CD in the Wergo series, WER 2012-50.
JC sez he was using the golden mean for the ratios
of the partials, the ratios of the "octaves", and
the overall form.  I can dredge up more details
from talking to him at the time, since we were
slaving away in the same dark and cavernous room,
but it sounds like you can get info from the source.
Stria was written in 1977, so I didn't mean to
imply anything wrt O'Connell (whom I've also never
heard of).
