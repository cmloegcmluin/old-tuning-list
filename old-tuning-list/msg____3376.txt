I read the same thing in that post.  It just reminds me of the Gamelan
Sekar Jaya performance I saw a month ago in Marin: at the end of the
concert, the players cordially invited the entire audience to come down and
bang on their gamelan instruments.  Only request was that you not step over
them, out of respect for the spirit of the instruments.  -rick
