>In the key of C major, an authentic cadence is the chord progression from the chord GBDF to CEG.

That would be a V7(1 oclk chrd) to a I major triad(12 oclk)..or even less 
dreadful, sol-ti-re-fa  to do-mi-sol-do(or do-sol-do-mi). If it don't 
resolve to I major it ain't bbshop.

>That is as opposed to a plagal cadence (for example) which in C major is FAC to CEG.  Or as opposed to (probably) the most common form of 
deceptive cadence:  GBDF to ACE.

This would be The 11 oclk=IV7 to I major...the churchchord resolution...a 
fine way to end a song. GBDF to ACE is resolving(?) to a 6th..frowned on 
in bbshop.

>    That progression (the authentic cadence) is extremely common in Western music as a whole, but I seem to recall - again, perhaps 
incorrectly - that virtually all chords in barbershop work are (dominant) 
seventh chords.  In that case you would not technically have an authentic 
cadence, since the tonic chord would be a seventh chord.  (That could be 
used as a fragment of a chain of secondary dominants, but perhaps I ought 
not get into that.)

Yeah, you ought to leave this alone since it doesn't seem that you've 
ever heard bbshop harmony. 95% of bbshop chrds consist of 1: major 
triads;2: 7ths;3: minor 7ths(flat 3rd)4: minor 7ths flat 5;5: and least, 
minor triads. Good bbshop should contain at least 35% 7ths and less than 
5% of diminished chrds=root,flat 3rd,flat 5th,flat 7th(6th).
