That's not so surprising. The Gandhaara Grama or ga-grama for short
was already obsolete in the time of Bharata. (Grama by the way means
"tone system", or "basic scale".) The descriptions that survived are
only vague. It's said to be a scale more for the gods than for the
people. It has less fifths than the sa-grama and ma-grama. Several
authors tried to deduce what it could have been, an alteration of
the sa-grama or ma-grama. The possibility that appears in most books
is 3 2 4 3 3 3 4, given by the 13th century author Sarngadeva in the
book Sangita Ratnakara. So these modes are only theoretical, it's
unlikely that any one is used in practice.

The 22-tone sruti system is by no means uncontroversial, but
experiments where musicians tune instruments or oscillators have
produced tunings that are in good agreement with the theoretical
values. There are many theories as to why there are 22. One
connection that has been made is, there are 7 natural tones and 22
srutis, which is a clear reference to 22/7 (pi).

The sixth sruti is 6/5 (or seventh if you start counting at 1) but in
this case it would be 1 7 1 4 1 7 1 for just minor thirds (ignoring
schismas).

The value 729/512 instead of 64/45 also makes the scale inversionally
symmetrical around the interval 6/5-5/4.
