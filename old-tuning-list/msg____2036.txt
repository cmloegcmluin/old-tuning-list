Subject: Posts from Brian McLaren

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

I will be uploading one of a new set of messages from
Brian McLaren per day for the next few weeks. At his request, I will 
not title them in the Subject line. (My own posts will have titles
so they can be distinguished from his, though I imagine content and 
tone will be sufficient indications of authorship. )
	Also, I do not have time at the present to edit or reformat
them. So, read'em at your own risk. :-).
	 As Brian does not have a telephone or email, any comments or
questions that need a quick answer should be sent to him by US mail, 
though I do send him the accumulated Tuning Digests on a disk about 
once a month. His US mail address is the following:
 
	Brian McLaren  
	2462 S.E. Micah Place
	Corvallis, OR 97333-1966-17 
	USA 
 
(Note the non-standard ZIP code. OR is the state of Oregon.)
 
--John
