Having been away for a while, I've just caught up on the tuning lists of
the last ten days. (It took awhile to recover from meeting Erv Wilson and
many other fabulous tunists in L.A.)

Indeed, let me repeat John Pusey's remark that the Bosanquet book is very
much in print. In fact, all the Diapason Press publications are worth
having. There are three series, involving music and books.

For a simple but fun introduction to the 14-note stellated hexany, the
Musicworks reference is to No. 60. In that article I didn't discuss
everything by any means, but there are some nice diagrams (mostly Erv
Wilson's).

Paul Hahn rarely makes mistakes, so I will humbly point out that the
vernal equinox isn't in May in my part of the world...and I suppose the
Latin plural would be equinoctes rather than equinoces, since the stem of
the noun nox is noct-.

To Neil Haverstick, two points. For some years I was in the habit of
keeping a calendar with a starting date of the winter solstice. The
problems in doing that are considerable. Oddly, one of them is not syncing
with the rest of the world (who cares about that) but in figuring out when
the solstice was throughout millenia. I have yet to find an astronomer who
cares enough about the answer to give an accurate one.

I'd also prefer a week of 6 days and months of 5 such weeks, but don't get
me started...the clock I have running in my office is a digital dozenally
metric one, with the day divided into nested 12s. Hope that doesn't get me
thrown off the tuning list. But 12 is a lot better for counting time than
the mishmash we have of 10, 2, 5, 12, and 60. (Don't worry, there are only
three of these clocks in existence.)

Second point. For a CD, what about resuscitating the "19 for the 90s"
project? Of course I have a vested interest in that, having a 19-tET piece
almost ready not in the original planned collection. But I'd also be happy
to see that collection without my contribution. Maybe Gregg Gibson would
become a patron for it...

To Joseph Downing: The Johnston 4th quartet does not have any 11s in it,
not deliberately, anyhow. Strictly 7-limit, and not always that, because
some variations are simpler tuningly (to neologize adverbially).
