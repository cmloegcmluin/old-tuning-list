This is the Blue Book standard which specifies the CD Extra standard, also
known as enhanced CD.  It is a multisession CD with audio recorded on the
first session and a data track recorded on the second session.  Early
enhanced CDs had problems with the data track being playable by the CD
audio players, creating horrible static noises if you inadvertantly
selected that track.  The Blue Book standard fixes this problem.  However,
some CD-ROM drives will not read multisession disks.  I don't have a CD
Recorder myself and have no idea how much this would cost or how many audio
mastering studios support it.  This could also eat into our allotted track
times if we try to store bit map graphic files of a few scores or a lot of
photos.
