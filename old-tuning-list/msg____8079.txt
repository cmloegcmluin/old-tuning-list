What difference does it make how the samples are tuned?  So long as you
correct for mistuning, there shouldn't be problem.  That is, record a
sample as being Eb, 0.32 cents sharp of equal temperament, or whatever.
It's really easy to work out the pitch of a sample: count the number of
bytes in the loop.  Anyway, give us a sampler and we can tune the samples
ourselves.  And a lot of voices will use square or sawtooth waves which
can be tuned accurately.  This isn't a good argument for poor tuning
precision, even if it is the argument they give.

Well, we can but ask.  Most manufacturers seem to be ignorant that we
_want_ higher precision.  I prefer to focus my efforts on encouraging
people to use the tuning capability they already have.  Hence my website
-- now with an equal temperament page!

There we are, had to get the plug in.

Do they?  Have you tested the accuracy, or is this merely the precision
of the tuning table?
