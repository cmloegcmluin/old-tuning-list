Subject: another Partch trivia question

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Remember Allen's trivia question about Partch and Varese?  Well, here's 
another one which I find interesting and perhaps pertinent to the 
discussion at hand.  Here's a clue:  I don't think that Partch supported 
himself solely by royalties.

Which non-composer is the connection between Harry Partch and the Kronos 
Quartet?

Yours,
Adam
