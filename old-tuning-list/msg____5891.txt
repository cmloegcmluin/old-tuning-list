   I should acknowledge that I do realize that just because a theorist
doesn't have the time, resources, training, or whatever, to put his
theories into musical practice doesn't mean that that line of theorizing is
pointless, or uninteresting musically.  I suspect that Neil too would agree
with that, since he's expressed a lot of excitement for the ideas that Erv
Wilson and others have provided for his musical practice.

   So go ahead and theorize;  I'll even pitch in too!  But I think that
it's important for theorists to acknowledge that although a really cool
theory is commendable in itself, what ultmately matters is cool music
coming from that theory. I think it's also important to encourage theorists
to try out their theories for themselves.  Go ahead - have some fun with
the sounds your theories have predicted!

   Let me also encourage pure theorists out there, when presenting a
theory, to also speculate to practical performers about possible ways to
use that idea in practical music.
