Subject: Notation

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

Adam Silverman mentioned the notation I prefer. I learned all of this from
Erv Wilson. A good deal of my music tends to modulate over a wide harmonic
lattice of several dimension. So for the players* sake, I like to have as
little ambiguity as possible and would like all identical written intervals
to have identical size. Johnston*s notation does not do this, as it is
based upon a scale with a mixture of three and five intervals, and depends
upon identification of a tonic. Thus, within the key of C, for example,
Johnston*s fifths C/G and D/A are not both 3/2 intervals. Moreover,
Johnston*s notation obviates the fact that the conventional staff notation
is a perfectly natural vehicle for Pythagorean intervals. (And players of
bowed stringed instruments do play fifths fairly well, but need to
consciously correct to get thirds and other intervals in tune; outside of
Anglo-Irish folksong - and there only inconsistantly - I have not
encountered the syntonic diatonic as a _natural tendency_).  So, I use the
conventional notation (with potentially unlimited sharps or flats along the
series of fifths) to describe a basic pythagorean series, modifications by
the comma 81/80 and 80/81 are indicated by 45 degree slanted upward plus
and downward minus sign. The septimal modifications of 64/63 and 63/64 are
indicated by an inverted seven and an upright seven, respectively. The
intervals of eleven 33/32 and 32/33 are indicated by arrows up or down.
Additional symbols have been used for ratios of 13, 17, 19, 23, but I must
admit to having been rather inconsistant with them. 
There are two pieces of self criticism that I may offer with my present
answers: (1) Compound ratios do become a bit notation heavy, and are slower
to read, but these relationships are more difficult to learn anyway, and
this method seems to work. (2) In very microtonal passages, pitch height
may not match notational height. I have decided to accept this point in
lieu of going to a further step and using a notation with  more than seven
nominals, such as the twelve-nominal notation proposed by Wilson in
Xenharmonikon.

I am not particularly attached to my notation but I do find it curious that
so many people have made transcriptions of Partch scores in Johnston*s
notation which goes against both the whole limit (factoring) idea of
Partch, and Partch*s decided invertibility. Moreover, the instances in
Partch*s music which are based upon the syntonic diatonic scale are
minimal.
