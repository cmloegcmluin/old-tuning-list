It had two imperfect fourths of 494 cent as tetrachords, connected by
a whole tone of 212 cents.  It was not the original intent of the 
designer, Abp Chrysanthos, for the imperfect fourths, but mistaken 
calculations (building the tetrachord from the whole tone).  As Barbour 
says regarding Agriola, ("... like many another good man, confused 
geometrical with arithmetical proportion" p 152).  The tetrachord is 
now set at 4/3 and the morion at the 30th root thereof.
