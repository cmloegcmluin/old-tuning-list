Subject: Help!

From: "Silvio Segantini" <sarastro@etr.it>

Hi everyone, 
This is the first time I write to Tuninglist. I hope this is the right
place where I can find the information that I need so urgently. I didn't
work before with temperaments, but now I have to prepare in short an
examples tape containing some very simple four-part choir settings in which
different
historical temperament are employed (Pythagorean, JI and 12-ET). Other
examples, little more complicated,  are in a ET as assumed framework but
coming with some irregularities (like a soprano-part sharp of 1 cents or
more). 
My problem is that I don't know at all the technology to work with that,
so, please: how can I realize it? I think the best way will be to employ a
synth. Could you suggest me a microtonal one and a software able to fine
retune *individual* tones (until 1 cent resolution).
Thanks in advance to everyone will lose time with my questions!!
