Subject: Spelling Checker

From: mr88cet@texas.net (Gary Morrison)

I've seen other jokes of this nature, but I don't think I've seen this
one in particular before.





AN OWED TO THE SPELLING CHECKER

     I have a spelling checker.
     It came with my PC.
     It plane lee marks four my revue
     Miss steaks aye can know sea.

     Eye ran this poem threw it,
     your sure reel glad two no.
     Its vary polished in it's weigh,
     My checker tolled me sew.

     A checker is a bless sing,
     It freeze yew lodes of thyme.
     It helps me right awl stiles two reed,
     And aides me when aye rime.

     Each frays come posed up on my screen
     Eye trussed to bee a joule
     The checker poured o'er every word
     To cheque sum spelling rule.

     Be fore a veiling checkers
     Hour spelling mite decline,
     And if were lacks or have it laps,
     We wood be maid to wine.

     Butt now bee cause my spelling
     Is checked with such grate flare,
     Their are know faults with in my cite,
     Of none eye am aware.

     Now spelling does knot phase me,
     It does knot bring a tier.
     My pay purrs awl due glad den
     With wrapped words fare as hear.

     To rite with care is quite a feet
     Of witch won should be proud.
     And wee mussed dew the best wee can,
     Sew flaws are knot aloud.

     Sew ewe can sea why aye dew prays
     Such soft ware for pea seas,
     And why I brake in two averse
     By righting wants to pleas.
