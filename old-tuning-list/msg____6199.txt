Subject: Re: Cakewalk CAL language, etc.

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
        I just posted an article by Paul Erlich on 22TET on my web page at
http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html
Look under "Notes on Microtonality". Be advised that Paul has not had a
chance to review the HTML document as posted, so any weird formatting or
missing .gifs are my fault. I encourage you to submit reviews,
articles, rants, etc. and I will be glad to post them. I believe Paul used a
"convert to HTML" utility in his word processor, which is necessary in an
article such as his with lots of figures and tables, but should your
submission be simple text, it is not too difficult for me to add a few
HTML formatting commands.
        Also, I recently purchased Cakewalk Pro Audio and a Soundblaster
64 AWE soundcard. It seems that Cakewalk may be programmed to have some
rudimentary microtonal capability with its CAL programming language. Does
anyone on this list have any experience with CAL? My first efforts to
insert pitch bends with CAL based on note number were failures, but from the
few code samples included it looks as if it should be possible.
