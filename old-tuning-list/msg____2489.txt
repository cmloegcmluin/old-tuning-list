Sorry. I took them as such, as that
was what I really wanted.

Certainly.

In fact, I suppose, what I'm looking
for, which might be too much for a post
on a list such as this, is an "ency-
clopedia of scales," that I could
pick from, program my computer to play
(or set any sufficiently variable-
pitch instrument to play), and thus
hear it.

This is a nice idea. I'd be interested
in the sort of algorithm you use. It
will somewhat depend on how similar
"similar" is, of course.
