Subject: Re: So you want to be a microtonal composer?

From: HFORTUIN@delphi.com

You should definitely check out "New Music with 31 Tones" by Adriaan Fokker,
published by Verlag fur systematische Musikwissenschaft GmbH in 1975, if you
seek to incorporate some good insights into 31-ET tonality as researched by
Mr. Fokker and friends. If you're lucky, you can find the English translation
by Leigh Gerdine in your university music library, but otherwise you might
find the Dutch or German translations. Perhaps Webster 
College in St. Louis, where Gerdine was president, could be of assistance.

You probably already know about Joel Mandelbaum's exhaustive dissertation done
at Indiana U. in 1961.

Best of luck with your research. Let us know when your dissertation is complete!


f you're looking for any more tonal microtonal music, I could send you copies
of pieces I've done in 19 and 31-ET which are very oriented twoard harmonic
exploration of intervals such as the neutral 3rd, 7:4 equivalents, etc. At the moment, I'm creating the final computer-notated
versions of these, but can let you knwo when they're complete.

Sincerely,
Harold Fortuin, Ph.D.
