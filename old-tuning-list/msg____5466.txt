Subject: JI and ET

From: BRIAN B. CARLSON  <bricarls@du.edu>

I find this discussion on JI vs ET very interesting.  If I understand 
correctly, perhaps the principle benefit of equal tempered scales is 
symmetry, which allows for modulation and key changes.  Every note is 
largely understood in its relation to other notes.  With non ET scales, 
the relationship of one note to the others can get much more complex.  
Jim had quoted from Danielou about the content of a note being fixed and 
building it up over the course of a whole piece of music, then subtle 
differences of meaning can be given to each note.  Is this how JI 
composers create music?  I would be very interested in hearing how non ET 
composers create music, how do you structure a piece of music where 
pitches are all over the place, and the relationships  are completely 
different from equal tempered music.  Thre must be some composers on this 
forum who have structured compositions in just tunings, or any non ET 
tuning for that matter.
