Don't get me wrong--I love Partch's music.  In this chapter, however, (if 
I understand it correctly) he is a little shaky on tonal drive.
     Partch begins with a disclaimer that these are simply observations 
from his own ear.  I quote from the Book (Genesis XI):

"The extent and intensity of the influence that a magnet exerts is in 
inverse proportion to its ratio to 1... This means simply that the extent 
and intensity of the influence of 7, for example, are just a seventh of 
those of 1."

His two following observations seem quite in order to me, but this one 
reminds me of the scene in "Dead Poet's Society", where poetry is ranked 
on a Cartesian Plane.  How could HP aurally determine if a tone's pull is 
1/7 of another?  Often Partch presents strong arguments without strong 
facts.

Yes, this is a pedantic observation.  I agree that the lower identities 
have a stronger pull towards each other.  The reason that I grumble at 
this is that it only brings the polemic closer to what may be the 
inevitable conclusion: that JI tonalities should be treated the same as 
12TET ones, but with more care to use microtonality to its fullest 
potential, and to intensify consonance and dissonance as needed.
