Yes. As much as I agree with Neil that it would be more valuable to
start educating guitarists on microtonality than obsessing over getting
perfect 12tET, it is the latter that Feiten's system is geared toward.
In addition to the usual bridge adjustments, Feiten proposes some
string-specific nut adjustments. I remember Steve Vai saying he is
getting Feiten's system installed on all his guitars, as he was never
before able to play chords anywhere on the fingerboard and have them all
sound in tune. When playing along with keyboards, etc, it is 12tET that
defines whether one is in tune or out of tune, and deficiencies in 12tET
itself are not really an issue to most musicians, who have never spent
time listening to purer intervals.
