Subject: Mathew Rosenblum on UCSD concert

From: monz@juno.com

Attended a concert tonight at UCSD which featured
the New York Contemporary Ensemble.  I was surprised
and pleased to find that two of the five pieces
were by Mathew Rosenblum, who composes microtonally
using a unique tuning which he partially explained
to me.

It's evolved from a 19- to a 21-tone system, which
contains the usual 12-equal, and also other notes
which form just ratios with those and with each other.
Not yet totally clear yet on how that works -- he'll
explain more elaborately to me by email, and I'll
be describing it in my book (and probably on the website).
He has his keyboard player on a 12-equal piano and
an electronic sampler which has the microtonal notes.
Some of the percussion instruments are apparently
in a matching tuning, and the strings and winds adjust
when necessary.

The piece "Maggies" was particularly good, and
had some really beautiful chords with non-12-eq
notes in them.

Mathew is from New York, and now teaches at the
University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.
