Subject: notations/Fonville

From: Adam Silverman <adam.silverman@yale.edu>

Reply to Jonathan Walker's comment:

That's an interesting point about Fonville's misunderstanding of the 
OT/UT concept; it's especially funny to me since this is the very point 
on which I was just corrected by David Doty regarding my new article in 
1/1, to be found in the next issue (whenever that comes out).

I stand by my recommendation, however, that John Fonville's 
"Perspectives" artcile is the best introduction on Johnston's notation 
written so far.  In spite of his confusion with labeling intervals as 
"otonal" or "utonal", it is a concise and clear introduction to Just 
Intonation as Ben applies it, and especially to his notational 
system--the best which I have found so far for extended JI (excluding 
Dan Wolf's alterations to this system, which seem to be worthy of 
canonization except that it seems to me that if one uses Ben's notation, 
then it is easier to use Ben's performers.  Perhaps Dan should explain 
his take on the whole thing (using a 3-limit focus instead of Ben's 
5-limit bias; if Dan doesn't remember our conversation, perhaps he can think 
back to Krems an die Donau... he taught me quite a bit an a late-night 
steak house).  Fonvilles small article is certainly clearer than Von 
Gunden's book, and also more concise than Doty's, which spreads JI and 
extended JI over many chapters.

My biggest problems with this notation involve complicated chains of 
accidentals, and I'm trying to figure out a good way to use key signatures.

If you have a real gripe and would like to set Fonville straight, I 
suggest that you write him at San Diego State University before he 
completes his large book on Ben's quartets, which will certainly include 
a 
chapter on this subject.

As soon as I check out your material on generalizing this notation for 
meantone, perhaps we can discuss this off-the-list.  I'm not very well 
versed in meantones, though.

Yours,
Adam
