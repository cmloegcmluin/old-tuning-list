Hello all...since I'm on the road, I won't
be posting much this month.  So to give
you all something to read from me, I've
finally started my website.

All I have there so far is a fairly detailed
autobiography with some cool links (check
out my buddy Dan Palkowski's page --
although he's not particularly a microtonalist,
he has a flexible conception of pitch; and
some cool artwork).  If you're interested,
the URL is:

http://onramp.uscom.com/~monz/bio.htm


But -- stay tuned for a detailed microtonal
analysis of a Robert Johnson blues vocal.
(Hopefully I can put it up before I get back
home in July).

I'll be meeting with several of you out west.
If anyone else in California/ Oregon/ Colorado
or nearby is interested, email me and give
me phone# and address -- I'm driving, and
pretty flexible.

Enjoy!
