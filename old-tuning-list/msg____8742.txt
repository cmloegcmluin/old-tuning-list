Subject: Re: Trills:  Which Note First

From: Gary Morrison <mr88cet@texas.net>

The going opinion, from several sources including some reasonably
authoritative recordings, seems to be:
Baroque:  Top note first.
Romatic:  Bottom note first.
Classical:  No agreement, but more votes for starting with the top note.
