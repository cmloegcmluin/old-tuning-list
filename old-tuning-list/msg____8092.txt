Subject: church music, forum CD

From: Aline Surman <stick@uswest.net>

I did it again, by accident...while heading out to a church gig, which 
involves playing quite lovely Spanish/Mexican hymns, I grabbed my 19 tone 
acoustic guitar by accident..so, of course I played the gig, did all the 
tunes, and everyone sang as usual...I get a kick out of it, to be sure...

    The forum CD is about to roll; the last dat is on the way, checks are 
being cashed, and I will type the liner notes soon...after that, it's off 
to the presses. Remember, we won't know the final costs until we see how 
long the insert is...my graphics guy is quite good at finding creative 
ways to cut costs, so he'll give us the best possible deal...I will save 
all receipts, and will forward them to anyone who wants their own 
records...this is going to be a great project...anyone up for volume 
2?...Hstick
