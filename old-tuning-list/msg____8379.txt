>How are you tuning the strings on your 22ET guitar?

These days, basically just like standard 7-string, the "fourths" are 9
frets, and the "major third" between the second and third strings is an
extra-large one of 8 frets (1 cent off a 9/7 ratio). I tried other
tunings but I found that with this one, I immediately knew exactly what
to do, as a result of being a guitarist already and having thought about
22-tET for about 7 years. The minor tetrad (i.e., the 7-limit utonality)
is difficult to play in this tuning but not impossible. Certain
positions of the "minor seventh chord" (0 6 13 19) are also very
difficult. But I'm mainly a lead player and can wail away on scales like
0 4 5 9 13 17 18 22, 0 3 6 9 13 16 19 22, 0 6 9 10 13 19 22 and 0 5 9 13
18 22. My decatonic scales are easy enough but require four fingers per
string, a technique familiar to violinists playing diatonic scales but
relatively new to me . . .
