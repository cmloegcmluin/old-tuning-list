Subject: Meaner tones again

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Paul E: The weights I used were 3, 5, and 5. My error function
was thus 3*(F-X)^2 + 5*(TM-4*X+2*OCT)^2 + 5*(MS-3*X+0CT)^2.
(FÎnts(3/2), TMÎnts(5/4), MScents(5/3), OCT1200)
Your weights are 9 25 25, the squares of these. I weighted
the derivatives, you the squared errors themselves. I'm not 
sure which is more correct mathematically, but your unweighted
gives a slightly lower sum of sq'ed errors.

I thought our original question was optimising meantone-like
tunings. When one goes beyond the meantone range, other functions
must be used (8 fifths down for TM, 14 down for the Harmonic 7th,
8 d or 9up  for the TM for doubly positive systems).

Yes, I agree that JI triads are better than MT.

I agree that the 15/8 is much less important than the 6/5. In
fact if one sets the errors of the third and fifth equal,
one gets the 1/3 comma meantone, if opposite in sign, the 1/5
comma. In the first case the 6/5 is just, the second, the 15/8.
I have analysed the tunings in my post in terms of the abs values
of the errors. In which case the errors of the 5/3 and 15/8 may
or may not be equal in a given tuning. The sum of the  F and T
errors may or may not equal the errors in either the 5/3 or 15/8. 
I could take the algebraic sum of the errors rather than the abs 
value instead, I suppose.

Somewhat to my surprise, using the ABS function did not generate
any tunings different from the ones I got by the lst squares
technique or simply setting the errors equal or opposite. The
exact solution depended upon whether I minimized the abs(sum)
or sum of ABS (errors) as expected, but the results were still
tunings I already had.
