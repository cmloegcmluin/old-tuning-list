Mr. Gibson, you've obviously given a lot of thought to these issues, so I
think I must not be understanding what you're saying here.  Consider this:

Much of the popular American music from the first half of this century is
based on "Dixieland" chord changes.  The 7 notes of the diatonic major scale
are used, of course, but the progressions often include a circle of fifths
starting on the third note of the scale.  In C this is E7 - A7 - D7 - G7.
This addition of G#, C# and F# brings the total number of notes used to 10
per octave.  The Fm is also used frequently, adding an Ab to the mix for a
total of 11.

Somehow I doubt that Hank Williams' "Lovesick Blues" stretched the
discriminatory powers of his audience much, if at all.  It was his biggest
hit.

Obviously I'm missing your point somehow.
