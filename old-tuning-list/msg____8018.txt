From: Drew Skyfyre <steele@bom2.vsnl.net.in>

Gary,

You use a WX-11 non ? Well, if you're willing to put up with a monophonic 
synth, Yamaha's 
VL70-m is the business. It's got 1200/1024 res (thanks J.L.). And, it 
sells for @$500 retail. Physical modelling , multi-efx, and a WX-11 port 
on the front.  Also possible to connect multiple units and have them 
behave as one. Half-rack size and cute.
