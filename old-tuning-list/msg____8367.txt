Methinks thou art too sensitive. When I was younger, I drooled over 
Apple computers in glass cases, and had to content myself with a 
homebuilt Elf, a Pip, and finally a Sinclair until I could afford a PC 
running MSDOS. PCs are now dominant and Macs are finally releasing 
machines at around $1000. One reason why so little software is written 
for Mac these days- there is no economic incentive because the customer 
base is so small. It is not insensitive to fail to mention the platform, 
and it is really not that much work to do a net search. Besides, don't 
modern Macs run PC software also? (I am ignorant on this point, but I 
know several Mac users in my department run PC software on their Power 
Macs.)
