I'm responding only on memory, not having Partch's "Genesis of a Music" here to refer to. I'm sure others will 
pipe in with refinements if needed.

Partch used the idea of "identities" which are odd numbers in either the overnumber or undernumber position of 
the ratios which describe pitches ignoring octave transposition. A limit sets the highest identity he might 
use to generate a pitch set (ignoring octave transpositions). Identities are not factored together as in 3*5, 
so 16/15 is not in 5-limit, but requires 15-limit or higher. 
 
In my idiolect, a limit is different. A limit is the highest prime factor needed to analyse a given just pitch 
set. In this meaning, the interval 16/15 is a 5-limit interval, as is 243/125, etc.

A Numerary Nexus is the number you keep the same in either the undernumber or over number while iterating the 
identities in the other position to generate a tonality. 
 
For instance, to generate the Otonality of 3, iterate the identities in the overnumber position while keeping 
3 as the Numerary Nexus like so: 1/3, 3/3, 5/3, 7/3, etc. up to your limit. 

An Otonality is so called to match with "o"vernumber, since it is the set of overnumber identities which share 
a Numerary Nexus. All Otonalities follow the form 1/n, 3/n, 5/n, etc. (n being the numerary nexus). 
 
An Otonality is roughly analogous to major tonality, but may be closer to major chord quality, since we 
usually think of a major tonality as including the various diatonic chords available from a major scale, 
whereas Partch's tonalities move around with the individual chords, so to speak. The analogies drift apart 
rapidly with higher ratios. The septimal dominant (or whatever you want to call it) 4:5:6:7 would be a purely 
otonal chord, but would probably not be thought of by most as "major". Otonality is really an unique term 
which must be savored for its own theoretical functionality.
 
Otonality is distinct from the overtone series, with which it is sometimes confused. The o in Otonality does 
not stand for overtone. An overtone series includes all positive integers in the numerator but does not 
include all octave transpositions of those pitches, while an Otonality includes only the odd overnumbers, but 
implicitely generates all octave transpositions of those pitches.
 
An Utonality (u for "u"ndernumber) is the set of pitches you get from iterating the identities in the 
undernumber position, while keeping the same Numerary Nexus in the overnumber, of form n/1, n/3, n/5, etc. 
 
For example, the Utonality of 5 with 11 limit is: 5/1, 5/3, 5/5, 5/7, 5/9, 5/11.

Utonality is roughly analogous to minor tonality or minor chord quality. Utonality is distinct from the 
undertone series.

The pitch set you quoted 1/1   6/5   5/4   4/3   3/2   8/5   5/3   2/1 is what you get when you permute the 
identities in both the overnumber and the undernumber up to a limit of 5, remove the redundant instances, and 
express them in smallest ascending form (6/5 instead of 3/5 for instance), then throw in a 2/1 for the sake of 
"scaleness". The raw set would be:
 
1/1 3/1 5/1
1/3 3/3 5/3
1/5 3/5 5/5
 
The raw set may be what a tonality diamond is; I don't remember.
