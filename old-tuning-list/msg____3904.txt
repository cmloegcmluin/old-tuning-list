Subject: non-realtime microtuned MIDI

From: bf250@freenet.carleton.ca (John Sankey)

I have a program that takes a plain single-block MIDI file, adds 
pitch bends at the beginning of 12 channels, then puts each 
note in a different channel (but leaves them in 1 block), to 
tune harpsichord music to historical tunings. It seems to work 
on all computer cards and synths (at least 10,000 people have 
downloaded my files to date, see 
http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~bf250/harpsichord.html for links). 
Since there are 15 channels in GM (one being the reserved 
"drum" channel), that gives room for 3 enharmonics. When I 
record a mean-tone piece, I play it ignoring enharmonics, then 
go through by hand and decrement the velocity setting by one 
for the notes that go in the 3 extra channels (there aren't 
many, the arrow keys on my sequencer step through the notes, 
so it only takes a single click of the mouse button to 
decrement velocity by 1) so the program knows which ones they 
are.

Of course, exactly the same technique can be used for 
close-to-full microtuning by approximation with 15  12-tet 
tunings - the only problem is, what is the most practical way 
to tell the program what note is which when there are too many 
notes to want to do it by hand as I do now? Probably it would 
be to play the piece through N times, with a different 
velocity setting each time, playing only the notes in a 
certain class each time, then merging to a single block. Then, 
would it be easier to play by note number (note# 0-127, then 
128-255 ...), or interlaced (note# mod N = 0,N-1)? Or, has 
someone a better idea?

If the list comes to any agreement on this, I am willing to 
extend my program and make it available (freeware). I write in 
ANSI BASIC with the sole extension required being binary file 
I/O, so it should run on just about any computer anywhere. (I 
use QuickBasic on a PC now.)
