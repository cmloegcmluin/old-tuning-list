Subject: Un-clear?

I thought I was being brutally clear, but I can answer specific questions
about my comments.  I actually find your remarks to be un-clear, in fact to
the point of hard-to-believe...

>I appreciate that even worthless systems are worthy of extensive study -

Something is only worthless towared a given goal, as Steven Rezsutek has
said.  If you want to say something useful, say what you're trying to do,
why you're trying to do it, and then what results you came up with.

>55-60 cents as the limen of intervallic perception is well-established
>in the literature.

You've never said exactly what this amount means.  The difference between 12
and 19 tone intervals is not more.  You've got people responding to this as
if it were 6 different things.

>The 19-tone equal temperament _alone_ can give access...

Of the ones you've studied.

>Does he have a tuning system that he thinks is not ridiculous and not
>'un-good'?

I used "un-good" to describe your definition of melody, and "ridiculous" to
describe your statement on the linens.

I tune for the purpose at hand.
