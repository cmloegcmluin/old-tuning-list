I have read a few Heinlein but not that one.  I will have a look for it
thanks.

To continue the story about nature's music, after visiting the Cycles
Foundation and finding that others before me had also find that cycles
in many things seemed to have periods that were harmonically related I
gradually developed a theory which would explain this.  It also turned
out to make a lot of valid predictions about the universe at large.

On my WWW site (at the URL in sig block) I explain the harmonics theory
which lead to explaining these observations.  I will give a brief
outline here which is oriented towards music and which will tell us
something about tuning systems.

Imagine an instrument which when it is plucked (or struck or blown or
whatever) produces some fundamental frequency plus all of its harmonics.
The higher order harmonics will have less energy in them.  Now imagine
that over time each harmonic loses energy to its harmonics.  For the
curious, this is caused by a non-linearity in the wave equation and only
happens in a 3D wave so will not happen in a string for example).

So what goes on is this, energy is transferred as follows:

Frequency --> harmonics

1 --> 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ...
2 -->       4     6     8    10    12    14   ...
3 -->             6        9       12       15 ...
4 -->                   8          12         ...
5 -->                        10             15 ...
6 -->                              12         ...
7 -->                                    14   ...
.. etc etc

So what is happening here is that some harmonics are receiving energy
from multiple different paths, in particular 12 gets lots of energy,
while other harmonics such as 11 and 13 receive very little.  The
resulting energy pattern depends totally on how many ways each harmonic
number can be factorised.

When calculations are carried out to higher numbered harmonics an
interesting pattern develops.  These calculations can be carried out by
a very simple BASIC program:

n = (highest harmonic number)
dim x(n): x(1)=1
for i=1 to n/2
  for j=i*2 to n
    x(j)=x(j)+x(i)
  next j
next i

and the results are now in the x array and may be printed.

The accurate details of the patterns generated can be seen at:

http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-hanox.gif Harmonics 2 to 288 
http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-hanoy.gif Harmonics 288 to 69120
but for those who don't have WWW access here is a rough ascii
reconstruction of the relative harmonic energy for the strong harmonics
between 48 and 96:

---------------------------------------------  48
----
---------------------  54
--------------------  56 
------------------------------------  60
--------------------------  64
---
------------------------------------------  72
---
---------------------------  80
-------------------------  84
-----------------------  90
-------------------------------------------  96

Now a tuning person will instantly recognise the relationships present.
The 4 strongest harmonics are 48-60-72-90 or a major chord with ratios
4:5:6:8 and the just intonation scale is present as double the
traditional 24:27:30:32:36:40:45:48 ratios.  However there are two
additional values which are quite strong and these 56 and 84 which put
the ratios 28 and 42 in the just scale so as to allow a couple of good
dominant 7th chords with ratios 4:5:6:7:8.

There are additional weaker harmonics between these strong ones and I
have investigated indian music which has extra notes and found that
these extra notes are where they would be expected by the harmonics
theory.

At higher harmonics this pattern is repeated with variations.
I was going to write "minor variations" but realised that "minor" would
have a different connotation.  There are also examples of minor keys to
be found, such as the range 1440 to 2880:

-------------------------------------  1440
----
----
--------------------------------  1728
---
---------------------------  1920
-----------------------  2016
------------------------------  2160
----------------------------  2304
----
-----------------------  2688
---
-----------------------------------------  2880

Here the strongest harmonics are 1440-1728-2160-2880 which is a
10:12:15:20 tuning.

The predicted pattern of harmonics by this very simple rule is found to
very rich and to have many interesting musical meanings present.  The
pattern is characterised by many ratios of 2, lots of ratios of 3 and
lesser still of 5 and 7.  Although the other primes do appear as ratios
they do so very seldom.

Also, as we move up the harmonics scale we find that the key keeps
changing.  After every 2 or 3 ratios of 2 (2.38 on average) the key
shifts by a ratio of 3 and so that means that every about every 4
octaves (including the 2.38 and 1.585 from the 3) there is a shift to
the dominant.  At still larger intervals there is a key shift by a major
third.  It is at these points that minors appear.

The above patterns also match closely to the pattern of cycles found by
Dewey.  From this pattern I have calculated what periods should exist
for longer and shorter cycles and found that I get the right answers
even for long geological cycles of ~600 million years.  I am quite
convinced that the universe is a giant musical instrument oscillating in
the pattern that I described.
