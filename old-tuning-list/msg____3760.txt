From: hajdu@uni-muenster.de (Georg Hajdu)

Concert with microtonal and interactive computer music
******************************************************

Ensemble WireWorks will perfom a program with microtonal and interactive music
by Georg Hajdu, Belinda Reynolds, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Manfred Stahnke
and Frederic Rzewski

on October 24, 1996
at 8.00 PM

Concert hall:
C.u.b.a
Achtermannstr. 10-12
48143 Muenster
Germany

The program includes:

Two Cartoons
for synthesizer and computer by Georg Hajdu (in 17 TET).

Multitudinous Voices
for mezzo-soprano, keyboard and interactive computer by Belinda Reynolds
(software written in MAX)

Intermezzo
for narrator, synthetic choir, keyboards and interactive computer by Georg
Hajdu.
(The harmonic and melodic material is based on an FFT of telephone hiss.
The extracted pseudo-harmonic spectra have a random set of microtones that
don't match any just or tempered scale).

Studie II by Karlheinz Stockhausen.
This piece was recreated by students of the Muenster School of Music with
modern computer technology based on Stockhausen's instructions given in the
preface of his score. This piece represents an early attempt to unify
spectral and tonal principles. For this, Stockhausen used a tempered scale
with a step size of pow(5, 1/25).

Partch Harp for harp and microtonal synthesizer by Manfred Stahnke.
Manfred Stahnke, professor of composition at the Hamburg School of Music,
uses  a tempered scale with pow(1.9560685, 1/12) for the synthesizer that
approximates just 5/4 and just 7/4. Lacking the interval of the octave,
this scale is characterized by a constant "tonal shift." The harp in turn
has stable octaves and just major thirds and minor sevenths as well.

Coming Together by Frederic Rzewski was originally scored for ensemble with
narrator and varied instruments that pick notes in an improvisatory fashion
from a pentatonic sequence of notes. In our version for keyboard and
interactive electronics, the sequence is performed by the keyboard player
while the computer--following the Rzewski score--simulates the actions of
the improvising instrumentalists.

The performers are:
Georg Hajdu, electronics
Jennifer Hymer, keyboard
Annette Kleine-Rademacher, mezzo-soprano
Christiane Steffens, harp
Bettina Stucky, narration
