Well, hello tune-folks!

I've been just in the background, reading for a while, but I had a couple
of things to post today.

First, I got an email from John Catler of microtonal-guitar fame. He plays
with Johnny R. in the AFMM festivities and has his own groups. Now he also
has his own record label, to whit he says:

"Thought you'd like to know we have a website up now for our microtonal
music label, FreeNote Records. The address is:
	
	http://home.earthlink.net/~freenote/

Take care - JC"

You can all get there yourselves; unless I am sadly mistaken, our own David
Beardsley is moonlighting as an HTML jockey - I think he did their site.

Also, I noticed a few posts about Justonics products; I just happened to
pick up a July '97 Keyboard mag today (for WWW-related audio articles) and
there is a two page review of Justionic Pitch Pallette. I realize their web
site probably has a lot of the info, but here's another take on it (I won't
be reading it til tonight myself!).

Finally, I'll be posting a new bit of stuff on the Corporeal Meadows site
later today (God / RAM willing...), partly 'fetish' materials but also some
current news about recording and reading matter availability. Stop by and
look for the Current News...

Stay consonant, all!
Cheers,
Jon
