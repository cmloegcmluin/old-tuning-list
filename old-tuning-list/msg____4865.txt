In the March 1997 issue of GUITAR SHOP mag, there is a great profile 
of Jon Catler...the woman who wrote it got her facts straight, and als o 
let Catler talk pretty freely...get it. 
    Also, I hope you don't mind me reminding you again of MICROFEST WEST, 
March 8, at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, CA...this concert will 
feature a wide range of musical styles, from Rod Pooles' minimalist 17 
tone approach, to John Schneider's Partch renditions, and yours truly on 
34 tone eq acoustic guitar. Let's make this successful by coming out and 
supporting live music in fresh tunings...I KNOW there's a bunch of West 
Coast folks who will get into this music...let's get them all to mark 
their calendars now. Call John at 310-396-5915 for more info. PS...all 
you European microtonal fans note, I will be playing in Copenhagen on May 
25 at the SKRAEP festival...I'll let you know more when the date is 
closer...Hstick PSS...love to hear more about that female JI composer...
