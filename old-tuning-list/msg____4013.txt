Andrew's question made me doubt about the relation between pitch bend
numbers and frequency. I think though that the MIDI spec does not prescribe
a logarithmic relation. But it might well be that it's logarithmic by
convention for most synths and samplers. Maybe you can ask the organisation
that maintains the MIDI standard, the MMA. The e-mail address is
mma@earthlink.net. You can always do an experiment of course, send some
different pitch bend numbers from a computer and measure the frequency,
using a frequency counter, tuning forks, a software sound package or
whatever other means.
