   Many tunings can function quite well for traditional musical frameworks, and
as such traditional notation is a reasonable possibility.  The traditional
notation of these tunings still allows you to convey many of their
nontraditional effects too.  Tunings of this sort include 19TET (TET="Tone Equal
Temperament"), 17TET, most meantone- and well-temperaments, and some of the more
traditional Just tunings (with adaptions to show changes of tuning reference).
Examples of tunings that aren't generally amenable to traditional notation are
10TET, 15TET, 16TET, 22TET, 24TET, 31TET, and most nonoctave tunings, although
24 and 31 require only the addition of quarter-accidentals.

   Libraries worth!  Neil Haverstick just announced that he has completed his
street-wise musicians' guide to 19TET.  A number of people have said that they
like my EPS Xenharmonic Scales Disk documentation as a general introduction.
But most of the commercially-available books out there concentrate on one or two
types of tunings.  Fewer are truly general in nature.  

   But that is certainly not to suggest for a moment that they're not valuable
books.  David Doty's Just Intonation Primer, for example, is said to be one of
the most definitive and easy-to-understand books on JI.  (I personally haven't
had a chance to read it, but have heard nothing but good reports about it.)
Bill Sethares is probably about 3/4 of the way done with what I strongly suspect
will become one of the great landmark books in the field, exploring the
interactions of tuning and timbre - why certain tunings sound good and bad in
certain instrumental timbres, and the reverse.  (I'm helping review the
manuscript for him, so this one I can vouch for from first-hand experience!)

   And then there are the venerable old books:  Partch's Genesis of a Music,
Rameau's Treatises, James Tenney's and Barbour's books, for example.  And, down
in the nuts and bolts, there are lots of books and magazine articles on
Psychoacoustics.  Brian McLaren has read a lot of them, and can probably make
some suggestions if you're interested in them.
