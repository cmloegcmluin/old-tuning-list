   Yes, either numerator or denominator.

   16:15 is a 5-limit harmony (a half step in particular.

   Partch's tuning system, called "Monophony", IS just, rather than close
to it.  He chose it based on many goals, including what sounded good I'm
sure, but also on provisions for modulation, and other goals.  


   I'd probably better not say much more, because I don't claim to be an
authority on Monophony, and because there are many others on the list who
know more.
