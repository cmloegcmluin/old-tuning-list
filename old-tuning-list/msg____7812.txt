Yeah, but doesn't the 7-limit accuracy depend somewhat on the 5-limit
accuracy?  (Isn't the 5-limit a subset of your 7-limit in that example?)

Are you willing to accept a tuning that has good 7 ratios but horrible or
non-existant 5 and 3 ratios?

He told me as much on the phone.  Indeed, the majority of his work is in
12.  But he does believe that any ET is usable.  That's all I said.  He may
not believe it to the extent that Ivor did...

Well, this is a subjective thing, but I agree.  But I will note that...

1) The best of Ivor's stuff is roughly as good as the best of Blackwood's.
2) The majority of Ivor's work is un-recorded.
3) That in any case, the differences in quality don't have anything to do
with how usuable they thought various et's were.

That's what I mean.  Can you give an example where it's not true?

I was badly in need of sleep when I wrote that.  I meant that 25 has good
5/4's and 7/4's, but un-usable 3/2's. [That is, horrible fifths, but strong
thirds and sevenths]

Now you may point out Blackwood's assertion that 3/2 in 15/oct is not
un-acceptable, and that this is the same 3/2 in 25.  You may point to how
it's used in the Suite for 15-tone Guitar, a work which I absolutely love
to bits, and have the score for.

I will say that the 720 cent interval may function as the dominant in many
parts of that suite, but it does not function as a 3/2.  I cannot imagine
any two intervals more sharply contrasting in sound.
