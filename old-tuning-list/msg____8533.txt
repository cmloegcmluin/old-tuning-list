From: "Robin Perry" <jinto83@hotmail.com>

First, I would like to thank everyone who commented on my intersection 
of sets scale idea.  I am still re-reading my printouts of your 
comments, developing my understanding of terms & points of view
expressed.

It appears there has been discussion before my subscription to the list 
began concerning 11/n and n/11 consonances.  I can see how a
11/6:1/1 and a 20/11:1/1 could be considered consonant, but how the
11/8 and its like?

Anybody care to dredge up some old conversation for me?

Robin Perry
