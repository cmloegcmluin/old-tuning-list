Subject: A couple of questions

From: blee@dircon.co.uk (Brian Lee)

First question:
Does anyone know of any music for chorus written in other intonations. The
only pieces I know are by David Hykes and the Harmonic Choir (for those who
don't know them they use overtone chanting to stunning effect - best album
"Hearing Solar Winds") I would be very interested in hearing other
vocal/choral pieces (particularly in just intonation)

Second question:
Any other tuners from London/SE England want to meet up? Please get in touch.
