Subject: mystery music

From: "Adam B. Silverman" <Adam.B.Silverman@students.Miami.EDU>

Larry Polansky and Allen Strange both informed me, and LP wanted me to 
pass on the word that this piece of Lou Harrison's about which I asked is 
indeed not LH's, but infact Gendhing Chelsea, an exquisitely 
beautiful piece for choir and gamelan cowritten by Jody Diamond, performed 
at a Mills College concert.

There was another unidentified piece on the program, which perhaps 
someone can identify.  It was a 1960's-style collage of rough sounds, 
including lost of school-bell type sounds.  It is the first piece on my 
tape (probably the first on the concert, if my tape is complete.

The rest of the concert included, if I remember correctly, Harrison's 
Concerto in Slendro, Canticle #3 and the Double Concerto for vn and vc.
