   "Sources such as flutes and oboes and bells", eh?  

   That's kind of like saying "numbers like 2, 3, and 3738239.7564108".

   Bells are a totally different matter entirely from flutes, oboes, or
other woodwinds and strings.  True, none of them have mathematically exact
integer multiple partials, but bells are many many times further from
harmonic than woodwinds and strings.
