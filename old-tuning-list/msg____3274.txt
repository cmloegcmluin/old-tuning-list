There's the famous anecdote that someone from the East was at a
concert of Western classical music, and when he was asked how he liked
it he said he especially liked the first part. So his hosts asked
whether it was the first movement that he liked, he said "no, before
that!" I think it was emperor Hirohito but am not sure.

Glad you like it. Two things can be wrong. Either you are missing the
file 'help.par' which should be in the same directory as the program,
or you are starting the program up from another directory than the
one it's in. The program namely looks only in the working directory
for its datafiles: help.par, intnam.par, modenam.par, harmon.par, etc.
The working directory can be changed from within Scala with 'cd'.
