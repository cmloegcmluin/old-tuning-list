Subject: the word microtone

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Personally, I feel that the very word "microtone" came into being as
a reaction to the 12 tone eq temp system, and is therefore only
marginally useful on a deeper level. I think it is more of a reaction to
the 12 tone system than an accurate description of the vast field of
tunings and theory. Ironically, though, it IS a quick and easy way to
sort of describe what I am doing with music to folks who know nothing
about it. As I go on, however, it gets harder for me to justify any sort
of personal usage of the term to describe the way I am now perceiving
tunings and intervals. I wonder if cultures other than those with
a western European "classical" musical tradition use such a word for
their intervals...

    I see pitch as a quite endless continuum of points on an infinite
line of sorts, but it isn't really linear, either...it goes all
directions at once, and also includes the zillions of pitches which are
constantly zooming through the Universe, but which we aren't supposed to
be able to "hear" (although this ability can be increased with careful
study). I don't think I yet have a catch all word to describe my
concept...but, I will use microtone in a pinch...Hstick
