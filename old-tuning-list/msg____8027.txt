Subject: Disappearing Commas

From: "Patrick Ozzard-Low" <patrick.ozzard-low.itex@norfolk.gov.uk>

There have been various references to commas disappearing recently.

Could anyone tell me - is there a unique theoretical limit at which a 
comma (of different kinds?) may be said to disappear? Are there 
strict and not so strict definitions of which systems (or musical 
sequences?) of which this can be said to pertain/occur?   Is there a 
single accepted definitive reference which defines the 'disappearance 
of a comma'? (Helmholtz?)  These are things I missed in my education.

Thanks.
