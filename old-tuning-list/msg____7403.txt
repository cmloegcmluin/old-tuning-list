hi, ive been on this list for awhile but have never posted anything. 
I just started looking into tunings last summer after listening to
Riley's The Harp of New Albion. 
Im looking for advice on a synth. I have cakewalk6.0, an AWE64, and i
want to use Scala to do the the pitch bends. So if you were me, what
synth would give me the most bang for the buck? 
thanks
