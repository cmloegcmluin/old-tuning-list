Highly recommended! It covers a great deal of info in 8 chapters with 17 tables
and figures used. Includes Chapter Notes, Bibliography and Index.

The chapter titles are:

1:  Metaphysical Correspondences
2:  The Conflict of Musical Systems
3:  The Measurement of Intervals and Harmonic Sounds
4:  The Cycle of Fifths: The Musical Theory of the Chinese
5:  Relations to a Tonic: The Modal Music of India
6:  Confusion of the Systems: The Music of the Greeks
7:  The Western Scale and Equal Temperament
8:  The Scale of Sounds

Total pages: xiii plus 172. The publisher, Inner Traditions, has _many_ other
interesting music books available and they have a webpage at:
http://www.innertraditions.com

P.S. The $17.47 is a good price. I paid $22.46 for my copy purchased in June
1997. The suggested retail price is $24.95.
