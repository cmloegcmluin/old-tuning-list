I don't know which mail program you are using, but I use the mail window of
Netscape Communicator. It's better than a Microsoft mail program i.m.o.
You can change the wrap width, even set different values for outgoing and
incoming mail. The default value for outgoing mail is 80 characters.

Daniel Wolf's posts don't look good. Daniel, you mail program breaks lines
in the middle of a word and then puts an = at the end.
