Subject: Post: tuning thirds in triads

From: PAULE <ACADIAN/ACADIAN/PAULE%0005695065@mcimail.com>

The reason I differ with Paul Rapoport when he defines the m3 as simply 
"left over" from the P5 and the M3 is that in tuning a major triad, both 
thirds are important to my ears. Some of the experiments I discussed with 
John Chalmers provide evidence for this belief. For example, John (in Tuning 
Digest 1008) and I both heard that a chord tuned 0 400 720 was clearly 
"better" than a chord tuned 0 372 720, even though the M3 and P5 are equally 
false in both chords. (To refute an explanation based on a preference for 
stretched intervals, use the first inversion of these chords.) Therefore it 
matters whether you're using the best possible m3 in a particular tuning; 
just using the best M3 and the best P5 does not guarantee the best major 
triad. For example, try 64-tet. There the best perfect fifth is 37 steps, 
and the best major third is 21 steps. Changing either of these by 1 to give 
a better minor third of 17 steps improves the major triad. 64-tet is 
actually an interesting tuning; it is the simplest equal temperament that 
contains all "tonal" systems (defined according to my paper on 22-tET, the 
systems are pentatonic, diatonic, and a new system first found in 22-tET and 
described at length in that paper).

The above assumes that the "best" tuning of a major triad is 4:5:6, a 
statement which causes little serious controversy. Unfortunately things are 
not so simple for the minor triad. The 10:12:15 (or 1/6:1/5:1/4) tuning is 
lowest in roughness, but for a typical root-position voicing, 
(4:8:12:)16:19:24 will sound more stable. Gary Morrison has pointed out that 
there can be two different types of consonance judgments operating at the 
same time; I believe that one is based on roughness while the other is based 
on various factors having to do with how well the tones fit into a single 
harmonic series. 16:19:24 is typically still within the "dip" in the 
roughness function whose local minimum is at 10:12:15, so 16:19:24 is still 
less rough than just about any triad besides the major. To me a 
root-position minor triad sounds out-of-tune as 10:12:15, although I think 
12:15:20 (1/5:1/4:1/3) is a very sweet first-inversion minor triad.

So it is possible that the best thirds for the major triad are different 
that the best thirds for the minor triad. It destroys a lot of the 
mathematical beauty of 5-limit theory by bringing in the 19th harmonic, but 
I have to let my ears be the final arbiter, and in this case they tell be 
that the 19th harmonic is important.

A much-ignored study by Pierce and Roberts (I think; it's from the book 
_Harmony and Tonality_) found that untrained listeners generally fall into 
two categories, "pure" and "rich." The pure listeners liked just 4:5:6 and 
3:5:7 triads better than versions of those chords where the middle tone was 
displaced by +/-15 or +/-30 cents, while the rich listeners like the 
15-cents-off versions of the chords best, with no particular preference 
between a +15 and a -15 cent "error" However, for 10:12:15 (or 1/6:1/5:1/4) 
chords, both classes of listeners preferred the version where the middle 
tone was lowered by 15 cents. The authors of the article did not provide 
much of an explanation of this phenomenon. Note that although the 15-cent 
shift has about the same effect on roughness for both major and minor 
triads, the listeners may have been motivated not so much by the small 
differences in roughness but by a preference for harmonic series. The 
preferred version of the minor triad is very close to 16:19:24, which has a 
note octave-equivalent to the fundamental in the bottom voice. Thus in a 
sense it better resembles a harmonic series than the "just" or 10:12:15 
minor triad. The rich listeners may have also been attracted to the beating, 
which is on the order of 7 times per second for the +/- 15 cent versions of 
all of these chords.
