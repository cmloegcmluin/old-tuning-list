Do you still have this information?  How close is close?  

Does anyone know how these discrepencies affect sympathetic strings?

Also, looking at good Sitars, I noticed that the sympathetic strings each
have their own nut exactly beneath the fret that sounds the note they
amplify.  The sympathetic string's bridge is right beneath the main bridge.
It seems to me that these SHOULD be the nodal points for that note on the
instrument.  I can't imagine the air conducting the sound from one string to
the other.  Hundreds of years of design can't be that far wrong.  What am I
missing?
