?? I must be misunderstanding something.  If you analyze the signal
using a process which decomposes it linearly, such as a Fourier
transform, no energy is detected at the beat frequency.  What is a
decrease from nothing?  I think this is what Gary Morrison was talking
about when he said (talking about bram's beat-canceling idea):
