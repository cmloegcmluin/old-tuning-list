Subject: seeking midi tuning help

From: Joseph Milne <alfar@globalnet.co.uk>

Greetings to all!  I have just subscribed to this group and have a keen
interest in just tuning.

I am new to trying to understand sysex and would be very help with some
basic guidance.

I am trying to send the commands in Cakewalk to my Roland card to tune in
just tuning, but I seem to get no result. I suspect I am not writing the
sysex quite properly. I have some demo midi's which show the difference
between tempered and just tuning and they definitely work and the
differences are quite audible, so I know my card responds to the tuning
commands.

The message I am writing is the following:

F0 41 10 6A 12 00 00 20 00 50 5B 54 5F 42 4E 3E 52 5D 40 30 44 2F F7

Cakewalk sends it but the tuning remains tempered. So what am I missing out?

Sorry to be asking such an elementary question!

Best wishes,
Joseph
