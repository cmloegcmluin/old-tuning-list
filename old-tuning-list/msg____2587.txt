Ditto to John's comments.  I've heard the 7/4 is called the "interval of the 
elephant" in India.  Kirnberger used it in a flute sonata at the time of 
the American Revolution and notated it with an "i".  Tartini stuck it in 
his violin solos every once in a while.  More recently, Jon Catler based 
his melody to "Hey Sailor" (released on M-Tone as an EP produced by the 
composer).

In musical conversation the French use an English sounding "cents".  
Composers using quartertones think in 1200s.  You mention Savarts and 
they merely recognize the term.

John, perhaps it should be 866/865 as the level of discrimination rounded 
off to 2 cents.  I understand the context of communicating straightly, 
however I suspect that music departments everywhere continue to teach 
that the 7th harmonic - as well as the 11th and the 13th - are "flat" as 
if in "wrong".

Well Manual?  Being ashmatic myself I have a certain perspective on 
this.  Sensitivity in asthmatics serves as a warning to others of 
environmental dangers similar to the canaries used in mines.  I've heard 
that there is a bleeding between membranes that causes allergies, in the 
sense that a usually benign substance has a radical response to it by 
asthmatic that is "triggered" by the toxin.
an asthmatic that is literally triggered by the toxin.
