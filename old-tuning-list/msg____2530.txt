From: Gary Morrison <71670.2576@compuserve.com>

As I recall, Brian cited, as an example of his assertion that 2/19 doesn't
work like a semitone, a whole-half-whole-half-etc. symmetric mode, implemented
as 3 2 3 2 3 2, etc.  He said that it sounded kind of queasy as I recall.  When
I tried it on my 19TET guitar, I didn't hear what he was refering to, but I have
no reason to doubt that he's hearing something real.

   I think that Paul's right that a semitone can be a lot of things.  So if
Brian's point is that 19 has no single interval that can perform all of the same
functions as 12's single unified semitone implementation, then I'd say that he's
pretty clearly right.  And he's certainly right that that requires composers to
rethink a number of ideas that we take as axiomatic truth.  

   But if Brian's suggesting that 19 has nothing that performs ANY of the
functions of 12's single unified semitone, then I can't see that point clearly.
For example, it seems clear to me that 2/19 makes a perfectly effective diatonic
semitone, and 1/19 makes a perfectly effective chromatic semitone.
