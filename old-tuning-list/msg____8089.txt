I've recently added a synth help page with links that (sometimes) have this
information.  I'd like to keep the information on my charts to a manageable
level.

I've watched synth models come and go since 1979.  Back then, I couldn't
buy anything except a Buchla or Serge Modular or Korg PS series that could
do just intonation.  Actually, I couldn't buy them because I couldn't
afford their multiple thousands of $ price ranges.  By 1989 there were a
handful of models to choose from.  Today there are dozens of current models
supporting tuning tables, including several portable keyboards (the kind
with builtin speakers) from Yamaha, normally the bastion of lowest common
denominator consumerism.  So progress has definitely been made.  Nobody
expects the wishlist to be implemented overnight, but manufacturers
certainly can't do it unless they hear our input.

The microtuning wish list should also be useful for software synthesizers,
a market that is still in its formative stages and much more adaptable than
commercial synths.

Microtonalism will be raised on the priority list when there's more
commonly available music out there to be heard like Robert Rich.  That's
not up to the companies, that's up to us.  The more instruments that have
microtuning features, no matter how primitive they may be, the greater
chance we have of this happening.

The paper you cited is one of the reasons why we don't get better than 1
cent resolution from our synthesizers.  Is there a citeable reference that
gives pitch discrimination in terms of harmonic context?  I know list
members have done these experiments, but have the results ever been
published anywhere that carries the weight of a JASA paper?
