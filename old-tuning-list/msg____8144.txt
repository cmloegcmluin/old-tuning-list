Whoops, I say potato & you said tomato !  I wasn't refering to 
looping eating into RAM. I was speaking (so to speak) without regard to
 RAM usage.

What I was trying to say is don't bother using looping  just
to conserve RAM because of the tedium involved.Use looping for 
sustain if you like, but doing it to conserve RAM ,for thousands of wee 
samples....
Is there a doctor in the house !?

About the E-mu thingies, I was refering to their sample playback
synths, like the Proteus,etc. Not the samplers !
