Perhaps you and Daniel or others on the list are at semantic cross-purposes
here. I won't speak for Dan, but I consider music that uses intervals
smaller than a semitone to be microtonal not because they sound strange,
but because that's what the word's etymological basis is. Personally, I do
NOT consider slendro, Iranian music with 3/4 tones, 7TET, or mbira music to
be microtonal. I DO consider Carrillo and Partch to be microtonal (most of
the time).

If you are looking for a word that refers to the "strangeness" of the
sound, perhaps a better term would be "xenharmonic" (xen = foreign).
Personally, I've never grown attached to that neologism because of that
connotation, which, as you point out, is culturally and personally
relative. I happen to like Ken Wauchope's term "allotonal," meaning
"alternate" tuning, but it doesn't seem to have caught on.

One cannot deny Johnny's point that definitions change over time, but I
don't think it's likely that his extreme broadening (which, if I'm reading
right, is microtonal = pitch-based) will catch on. People intuitively take
"micro" to mean "very small" because it's used that way in so many words. I
think it is useful to have a word that refers to music with small
intervals, just like it's useful to have terms like "just intonation,"
"equal temperament," or "pitch-based."
