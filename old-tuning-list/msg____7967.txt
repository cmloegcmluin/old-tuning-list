   I know only that, when Tom Stone's "Novatone" went under, Mark Rankin
said that they had a small outstanding debt to the company that custom-made
that wire for them.  They were holding the extrusion die they used to form
it hostage, so to speak.  I suppose it's fair to guess that Mark ended up
paying the debt to that company and bought the die, but I don't know that
for certain.
