I think you'll have to content yourself with the hiatus between
Brian's bouts of intemperate ranting [i.e. while he's off in his
little lair imagining American musical academia by reading
back issues of PNM at the public library and carefully crafting
straw persons whose burning provides the heat necessary to
warm his dish of bile]. Now that he's back to pointing out to
us all why he isn't wrong about anything and fulminating at
a world which doesn't recognize either his genius or his bias
set [cue quantized track composed of a sulky bank of cryptocellos
in 11-limit JI] *and* now turning his lordly gaze on the wonders
of the web with precisely the same witlessness he brought to bear
on the notion of canonicity, the season has begun anew. Isn't
it enough that we've had a brief season of relatively high
content Brian?

Ignoring him only encourages his more delusional episodes.
I am noticing a marked rise in grumbling about la Brian's
new batch of stuff - has dissing the boy moved from those
funky littie SoHo clubs to Lincoln Center, so to speak?

And by the way, as an obligatory nod to those 'orrible
Modernists who constantly bombard us with the dreaded
mindbogglizer radiation from their U.N. black satellites,
I've actually found some recent Petey Boulez that I *like.*
Horrors! It's the recent release of "Explosante/Fixe" on
Deutsche Gramaphone. Those of you who've found those
spectral boys of some interest [P. Hurel, D. Cohen, T.
Murail] will, I think, be somewhat pleasantly surprised
by what seemed to me to be a stronger sense of colour and
a bit of playfulness - to say nothing of some harmonic stuff
that sounds positively *consonant* in moments. Speaking as
a non-Modernist, I'm actually going to be playing the thing
for my radio listeners - it's that good. I understand that
DG is also finally going to be putting out "Repons" sometime
next year, as well, so we'll all have easy access to some
canonical Modernist Cabal stuff in glorious CD stereo.

Oh yeah - remember that I mentioned going to the Table of
the Elements festival in Chicago last weekend? I forgot to
mention - Tony Conrad's "Four Violins" (dating from his
days with LaMonte Young in the early 60s) has been released
by them on vinyl, with a rumoured CD version to follow soon.
In the meantime, you can content yourself with the vinyl
*and* "Slapping Pythagoras," also on TotE.

Microtonally yours,
you-know-who

I would go to her, lay it all out, unedited. The plot was a simple one,
paraphrasable by the most ingenuous of nets. The life we lead is our only
maybe. The tale we tell is the must that we make by living it. [Richard
