   And I'll add to that,
(4) Melodic passages involving intervals smaller than 60 cents are clearly
    musically meaningful.  I'm quite confident that NOBODY will perceive the
    chromatic run of quartertones C C+ C# Dd D as a subtle "shading" of
    C C C# C# D.  The fact that C C+ C# Dd D is a continuous rise in pitch,
    whereas C C C# C# D is a sequence of two repeated pitches followed by a
    third, is a more audible effect.  Repetition is almost certainly a much
    more basic psychoacoustic consideration than this melodic limen you're
    proposing.

   Or similarly, even if a melody doesn't use step sizes smaller than 60
cents, if it is taken from a scale that is nothing at all like a diatonic
scale, 9TET for example, then it can't possibly be viewed as a subtle
variation on a diatonic melody.  It is clearly systematically different at
its very roots.
