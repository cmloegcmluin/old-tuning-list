Subject: where the notes are

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Ray...I do agree that the notes are not "random" in Indian music; 
when I used the word "area," I meant that there were/are several 
different choices for each "pitch"...I imagine the Indian masters are 
pretty adept at hitting various ratios, mainly because they are trying to 
draw out the feeling/meaning of the note/ratio/sound in question. I would 
also imagine that often, this "area" or "note" is first learned 
intuitively, by playing it for long periods of time; then, later, the 
intellectual realization occurs. 
    Now, I have not studied Indian music formally, but have recently met 
two students who are studying it, and they don't have a clue about what 
they are doing, what ratios are, or any of the most basic concepts of 
tuning theory. They are learning by rote where to put notes...this is a 
typical feature of a master/apprentice relationship, where the 
relationship is pretty intense, and mostly one on one for a while. From 
what I understand, a lot of Indian musicians learned in this setting. I 
get the feeling the teachers don't give up everything all at once, and 
doubtless the secrets of tuning, which are intimately connected to the 
powers of sound, are not discussed at first. Again, I've seen very little 
knowledgable discussion of this tricky subject, because most of us are 
not practioners of Indian music...and even if we were, it still may take 
a long time before we would be taught the science/art of tuning theory.

    Also, when I said that you cannot tell someone where to put a note, I 
meant in an improvisational sense, where you don't know where to put the 
next note because YOU don't yet know where it will be, or, hopefully, 
even what it will be. When I teach my students blues or jazz, I am 
incapable of playing the same improvised line twice in a row...it's a 
hoot, because it's that quantum idea again...you can teach the concept, 
and some of the technical tools, but each person must get to "it" in 
their own way...Hstick
