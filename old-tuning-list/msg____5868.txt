I'm a Japanese guy enjoying this list...but..excuse me Erich...if you are
looking for something written in English and is microtunig-oriented...I
have no idea. The only one that I could find at a music book-store give
us a very rough info on this topic..that one just points oout the scale
in the western diatonic way...and is written in hard Japanese.

Maybe some could be found at the academic area...but I didn't study in
those field and have to ask somebody to make sure if that kind of
introductory really exists...

I'll keep this theme in my mind and will tell you if I could run into any
useful info.....sorry for my delay....I now only have time to open my
mailbox twice a week.
