In my article "Schoenberg's Concept of Tonality" (published in 1/1) I
point out Schoenberg's error of using the ratio 7/4 instead of 16/9 for
the minor seventh.  This one note does not not whitewash his hole theory.

Most troubling for me was the basis of Helmholtz for Schoenberg's
theories, but with nary a mention.  Sort of like Partch never mentioning
Carrillo perhaps.
