Dear Marc and all,

I'm in the same boat, and there may be more than a few of us, so I'll
write publicly.

This is a great place to play:

Microtonal Music -- a wonderful collection of links by John Starrett
<http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html>

Here are some articles that are basic enough for me, a
non-mathematician, to understand:

Tuning Tutorial, by John Starrett
<http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/tuningtutorial.html>

A Tour Up The Harmonic Series, by David Canright
<http://math.nps.navy.mil/~dcanrig/harmser.html>

Pentatonics I Have Known, by David Canright
<http://math.nps.navy.mil/~dcanrig/pents.html>

Best regards,
