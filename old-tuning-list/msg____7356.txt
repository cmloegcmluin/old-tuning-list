   I think I recall people mentioning these two scenes:
STII:  The music behind the computer-generated animation of how the "Genesis"
       device works.  I think that was ... oh ... probably something like
       about a half hour into the movie, as a guess.
2001:  The vocal (choral) music associated with the black monolith.  Probably
       something on the order of 15 minutes into the movie, again as a guess.
I haven't checked into either of those suggestions.  I don't recall either
being particularly microtonal, but I don't have any reason to doubt what
they're saying.

   Some other comments in this thread bring to mind a personal opinion
about microtonality in general:  There's a big difference between music
being microtonal, and having notes detuned here and there.  I personally
believe that a truly microtonal composition should be tuned, preferably
systematically, unlike 12TET throughout the entire composition.
