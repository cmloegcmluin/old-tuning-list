Subject: Neandertal flute revisited

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

The 11 April 1997 Issue of Science has a picture of the Neandertal
flute fragment on page 205. The age is given as between 43,400 and 67000
years, based on the dating (by methods unspecified) of sediments above
and below the the flute's layer.

I haven't read Fink's book or essay "The Origin of Music," so I can't 
comment on why he thinks that this sequence or diatonic sequences in 
general follow the harmonic series. I tried to read his web page via 
Lynx -- an interesting, if frustrating experience. If anyone missed the 
earlier discussion, Fink's web page is at
http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm

Anyway, Fink and the discussion in Science mention work suggesting that
newborn infants prefer consonant to dissonant tone combinations. I've
also read that they prefer their mother's speech (or at least her speech
sounds) suggesting that near term fetuses can hear in utero (shades of
L.Ron Hubbard and his "engrams"). If this were so, musical preferences
should be culture-specific. I've read elsewhere that young children
show no preference for consonant chords accompanying simple melodies.
Any up on this area?

I did get a chance to see the April Discover and was amused by the
mastodon tusk tuba (tusks are mostly solid ivory), windchimes, etc.
Clever....
