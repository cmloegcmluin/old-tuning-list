Thank you so much. This is really cool to be able to receive stuff like this.
I hear the vibrato you wrote of. It sounds like all the voices are moving
at the same rate, which means the vibrato is in the AVM Summit, and not in
the Kurzweil sample, otherwise, the vibrato rate would change with the 
playback rate of the sample and each pitch would have a different vibrato rate.
Are you sure there's no vibrato parameter you can tweak on the AVM Summit?
If not, bummer--you're stuck with vibrato on all sounds, even piano.

I'll listen back and forth between the annie.mid and the annie.wav to
get a better understanding of the voicings in the arrangement and write you again.
