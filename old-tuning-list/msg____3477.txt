I never thought of Partch as a novelty. I wouldn't equate him with 
Thumbs Charlie or Albert King (who really knew how to bend a 
note, seriously). I'd put Harry on the same level as, say, Charlie Parker
or Jimi Hendrix. A true innovator. Isn't he THE first western composer
in recent times to use just intonation? Way cool.

Whatever......................................................

Check out the British Harry Partch Society web page for the 
latest (July) issue. (just thought I'd mention that)

Which reminds me, what ever happened to 1/1? I paid
them for a membership renewal a year ago and got one newsletter
when I was promised three. Isn't that mail fraud? (Yes!)

Our (IMMP) web pages should be ready soon. The most recent
tape is the 1995 Trenton Avant Garde Festival Electro-Acoustic 
compilation. Along with five insane tape pieces and a virtual
minimalist sort of chamber ensemble, is my JI synth 
piece "Science Friction". 

It uses a tuning from the lower, but not too low harmonic series. 
As soon as I get covers and more tapes, I'll post something 
about how to get the tape for purchase or trade.
