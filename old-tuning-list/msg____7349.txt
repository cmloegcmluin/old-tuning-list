Subject: As an eager neophyte to the various tuning systems and just

From: "Brian Drake" <bd57@hotmail.com>

I just purchased a Korg MT-1200 tuner, which comes with several 
preprogrammed intonations, including just - major, and just - minor.  I 
have a couple of questions for those who know about this unit: (1) how 
does this terminology jibe with Partch's and those used in the Just 
Intonation Primer? and (2) I know my ears are spoiled by tempered music, 
but I don't hear any difference between these tunings and equal 
tempered.  How does one check to make sure the tunings are correct?  I 
tuned a double harp using the just - major tuning, and all the triads 
sounded too like equal temperament to my ear (admittedly unschooled as 
yet).  

Thanks for any comments and advice from the list.
