" Unfortunately, many people seem to 
think if you can't see or hear something, it has no effect on us...I 
don't believe this for a moment. We just don't KNOW the effect 
yet..."

   (The following is mostly a general comment;  it's a reply to Neil's
statement here only in a very loose, high-level way.)

   Mankind would certainly be very unwise to draw the clearly ludicrous
conclusion that we understand everything going on around us.  But on the
other hand, when it comes to things we don't know, we would also be unwise
to discount ideas widely accepted to be true for no specific reason.  

   Example:  It would be very unwise assume that Relativity will NEVER be
replaced as the basis for the study of macroscopic mechanics.  But it would
be equally unwise to suggest real validity to a UFO visitation hypothesis
that depends upon faster-than-light-speed travel.  

   We must build our view of the world around us upon the best model of the
universe we know, and not ignore parts of that model frivolously.
