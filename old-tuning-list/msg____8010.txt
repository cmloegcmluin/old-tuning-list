Subject: Gary : NOVATONE and Co.

From: Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi <esabat@adinet.com.uy>

Tom Stone originally called his interchangeable-fretboard company
"Intonation Systems" and later changed it to "Novatone".  When Novatone
cratered, Mark Rankin took over some of the remnants of the company and
started selling interchangeable fretboards more or less as kits.
