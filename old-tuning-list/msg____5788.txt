Subject: Scale Dimensionality

From: DFinnamore@aol.com

In response to my mention of prime number-based scale dimensionality, Daniel
Wolf suggests:

I appreciate your pointing out the terminology problem posed by that use of
that term.  It sure would be nice to come to a general agreement on terms for
the various kinds of "dimensionality" that one can visualize from various
perspectives.  I find use for all of the kinds that you mentioned, each in
its own way.  I suppose it could be a bit incongruous to speak of using,
e.g., the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th dimensions only.  Anyone have any suggestions?
