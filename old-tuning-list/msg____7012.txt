Dear All,

Many thanks for your thoughts on these...

Random, and (sorry) very hurried  responses -

Graham, do you mean 1) and 4) refer to different things? (ie., 4
refers to 3?) Or am being very thick?

General question: How essential is it to differentiate between
sampler and synth 'wish lists'?

Yes, this is an important consideration.

Gary, would you mind very briefly outlining how the Ensoniq works for
ATS? Supposing you wanted to map the sampler for a '22-ET string
trio' (to use my previous example) - would it be easy?

Thanks John..... duuurrrrr

I want 1) more partials and 2) a way of dealing with them so that a
patch ('instrument') can be set up easily.  For example, suppose
you've got a set of 36 samples, one for each (12-ET) note of a three
octave range (say, of bowed violin strokes). And you want to 'build a
violin' in 22-ET (or something) over 3 octaves.  Imagine this: select
range of samples (Sample Number 0-35); select range of partials
(Keygroups)  0-65 (3 octaves in 22-ET); select source tuning type
(12-ET); select destination tuning type (22-ET); select preferred
deviation (ie., whether sampler chooses nearest sample to map from
above or below desired destination frequency range - preferably from
above, so destination is not 'mickey mouse' );   press GO.  Sampler
creates 66 partials, maps samples 0-35 to said 66 partials, and
retunes accordingly.  Impossible?

Result would need to be checked/tweaked by user, but would save
trillions of hours.  Window type interface would be nice, but not
essential.

It was the 'Kit' bit that I wanted to emphasise.  The idea that the
'slots' themselves would be moveable... I don't really know how
parctical this could be (?)

Must dash,
