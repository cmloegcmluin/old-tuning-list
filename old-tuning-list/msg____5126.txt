Subject: science and such

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Yow...John Chalmers and I were thinking exactly alike, it seems...I was 
just going to make a post about science/mysticsm, and he addressed the 
exact topic. What I would like to add is this...through the wonderful 
minds on this forum, I am forced to clarify my own beliefs, and I like 
that. In this case, it's important to realize, I think, that throughout 
most of history, all over the world, people DID NOT separate the Universe 
up into so many different parts as we seem to do now. Science, religion, 
myths, symbolism, dreams, and "reality" were all a little more closely 
related than they are now. So, when John suggests keeping "mysticism" and 
"science" separated from each other, I think it robs life of it's deeper 
meanings. When you check out the deepest meanings of many of the musics 
of the world, you find many esoteric relations happening which involve 
the interrelatedness of sound, color, math, emotion, spiritual meanings 
such as truth, joy, honor, etc. and on and on. I think that we, meaning 
sort of European descended white folks who immigrated to this mysterious 
land, may be the first culture in the history of the Earth who have the 
concept of "athiest" or "agnostic"...there's a topic to investigate. Some 
ancient cultures believed that knowing the name of God was a great source 
of power, and did not treat such matters lightly. Sound was known to have 
great healing and destructive power, and was used more carefully than it 
is today. Today, sadly, we sometimes tend to think these beliefs are a 
little old fashioned, perhaps, and now we "know better"...I don't think 
so. In fact, I think we've forgotten much that we had best start 
remembering soon, about just who we are, and what our role in the drama 
of eternity is to be.

Math and science, religion and mysticism...what's the difference?

 Anyway, this forum is very unique, and lately has got quite profound at 
times. I don't care what a person believes as a personal philosophy as 
long as basic tenets such as peace, honor, and truth are displayed. I 
really am on some sort of quest in this life, and my involvement in these 
discussions is very important in that direction. Again, I don't know how 
to separate the Universe up into concepts such as art and science and 
religion...they are all descriptions of the same Universe, and there is 
no clear definition between any of them...Hstick
