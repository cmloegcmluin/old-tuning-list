Subject: recent Apple hardware and sound problems

From: Paul Rapoport <rapoport@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

On the subject of Carter Scholz's point re Apple hardware and sound 
production:

The lab here bought several Performa 5200s over the summer. Initially,
Lime would not launch. According to the Lime people, Apple created a
machine that did not work with its own MIDI manager. 

Most recent versions of Lime use QuickTime instead, thus enabling the
program to run most of its functions, but it may be impossible to use MIDI
with the current version of QuickTime. (I am unsure: the problem may lie
only with Apple's MIDI manager.) The Lime people responded immediately to
our problem, but they cannot fix what seems to be Apple's mistake. 

I'd be interested in anyone else's experience with MIDI on a Performa 
5200, using any music software.
