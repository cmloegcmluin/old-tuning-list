Subject: Auditory Display Conference

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

International Community for Auditory Display

This might be of interest to Tuning List'ers as sonification,
aka Auditory Display, is a possible commercial application of
the type of material we work with. For example, converting mass
spec or IR spectra to sound sometimes makes recognition easier
as some people's acoustic pattern recognition ability is superior
to their visual. The resulting sounds when presented seriatim become
non-just, non-ET scales and when presented simultaneously, non-harmonic
timbres.


The notice (forwarded I think from the IMCA mailing list):

ICAD '97, is a program of the International Community for Auditory
Display. ICAD is a not-for-profit corporation created to support
research, education and community formation in the emerging field of
auditory display. The primary projects of ICAD are the conferences, the
listserve (icad-request@santafe.edu) and the ICAD Web site
(http://www.santafe.edu/~icad). Since auditory display researchers come
from a wide variety of disciplinary, professional, and geographical
backgrounds, ICAD seeks, above all, to facilitate communication across
boundaries. A membership organization founded in 1996, ICAD welcomes
participation in its programs and governance. For more information
about ICAD please contact Gregory Kramer at kramer@listen.com.
