A third way, requiring less knowledge of technicalities, may 
be to use Graham Breed's "Midi Relay" software, 

http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm

 which sits between the 
keyboard and the PC's sound system, and makes the kboard play in any 
temperament you like.  I'm in the process of getting midi setup on my 
new PC, and haven't yet got to the point of testing it.
