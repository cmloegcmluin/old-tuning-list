I just looked it up. See
http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05516981__&s_clms=1#clms

I couldn't get the full images of the patent, maybe you'll have better luck.
It doesn't patent 19-equal per se, but essentially any instrument that plays 19-equal from a 3 row keyboard (where two of the rows also allow playing in 12 equal). We are still free to make an instrument that plays anything other than 19 equal from a 3 row keyboard and we are free to make one that plays 19-equal from anything other than a 3-row keyboard.

I'd rather a fixed 19 from 31-equal (or perfect-thirds meantone), you'd have a wolf fifth between E# and Cb but who cares. It would still allow modulation through 13 majors and 10 minors. Of course that was tried way back (not all the way to 19 notes but same idea) and those keyboards are only in museums.

>The patent also includes guitars, trumpets, etc.

It's the claims that determine what infringes a patent and their claims don't mention or even imply such instruments. They all specifically say "a keyboard musical instrument". Unless we're talking about different patents? I'm talking about US Patent 5516981, Yamaha, 1994, "Musical instrument tuned in nineteen note temperament scale".

I finally got to see the images. Yes there's a trumpet and guitar but these are not claimed. All this does is make sure no one else can patent them. It does not prevent anyone making and selling them. What I said previously still stands.

Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer. What I know about patents comes from reading the book "Patent it Yourself" by David Pressman. Believe me at your own risk.
