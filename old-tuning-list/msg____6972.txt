Tuning resolution of sample/wavetable based instruments better than 1 cent
is questionable since no manufacturer will tune their own samples to better
accuracy than this.  This is the issue much more than cost, since adding
the extra resolution in their custom ICs would be insignificant in terms of
design resources and transistors.  DSP or Virtual Modeling type instruments
could do better though.

You have to remember that manufacturers need to make a profit in order to
stay in business, and most provide the bare minimum of features that they
can get away with.  For instance, MIDI pitch bend has supported 14 bit
resolution for 15 years now, but nobody makes a 14 bit pitch bend
controller except Big Briar, 98% of them are 8 bit, the other 2% are 10
bit.

Building tunings into "Partials", Keygroups or Zones is tedious and
wasteful effort in my opinion.  Today's synthesizers support hundreds of
patches/programs, doing it that way virtually hard codes the tuning into
the sample set and increases your memory requirements exponentially.  I
don't think there's much question that most users prefer separate tuning
tables, the issues are:

Do you want octave based tables?
Do you want keyboard based tables? (Remember, these are virtually
impossible to retune note by note on the fly, ala Justonic Pitch Palette,
because of the limited MIDI bandwidth)
How many tables do you need?
Are the tables assigned globally or per MIDI channel?
Do you need to switch between tables or notes in realtime, and if so should
notes be updated immediately or on new notes only?
Is the MIDI Tuning Dump Standard supported?

Also, I believe any proposal to manufacturers must be presented in a
prioritized fashion.  If given as an all or nothing situation, you're most
likely to get nothing, or else get a confused subset of the requested
features.

The on-board absolute pitch meter is a very, very interesting idea,
especially for a sampler.  It would be a benefit for anyone creating their
own samples.

Starr Labs is working on a generalized microtonal MIDI keyboard that
supports polyphonic aftertouch.
