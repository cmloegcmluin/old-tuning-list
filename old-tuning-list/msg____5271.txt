Subject: Re: Neanderthal flute

From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

Even if we can establish that these were indeed musical instruments (and
not pasta strainers or candelabra), the list of variables to be covered
before a tuning is established is formidable: 

(1) the mouthpiece is missing: how much longer was it? was it  transverse
(if so, where was the blow hole placed) or vertical? If vertical, then was
it with a cut (like a quena or shakuhachi) or without a cut (like a nay)?
or was it a direct flute in the first place? A buzzed lip embrochure (like
a cornetto) is plausible, though I assume fipple flutes and reeds - both
more complex technologies - would be less likely.

(2) Has someone seen an X-ray of the instrument? Is the channel primarily
conical or cylindrical? (That makes a big difference in both overblowing
and fingerhole placement  - and one in which Gary's Science Fair project
would have been seriously affected; Benade's _Horns, Strings, and Harmony_
provides a fascinating introduction to woodwind building with useful
information on fingerholes). How deep are the fingerholes? Deep walled
instruments may have fingerholes of variable length which lengths become
critical to the pitch (bassoon players know about this; serpents and
racketts took advantage of this to create more reachable fingerings).

(2) The fingerhole placement has to be considered in combination with both
size and depth of the holes. How much have the holes increased in diameter
while decreasing in depth due to wear over the years?
