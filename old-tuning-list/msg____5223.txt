From: Daniel Wolf <DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com>

I like to use the terms _speculative theory_ and either  _music analysis_
or _descriptive theory_ to distinguish the creation of potential musical
resources (both in terms of materials and relationships between materials,
i.e. ''systems'') from the hermeneutic enterprise of describing and
interpreting existing musical works or characterizing attributes of
repertoires.  On the other hand the _ prescription_ of musical formulae,
which is what is generally taught as ''music theory'', and consists
essentially of giving algorithms for making variations on existing pieces
is possible only as a consequence of the speculative and analytical modes
and such ''recipes'' are hardly theory. 

Naturally, the speculative and analytic enterprises are at their richest
when they are not strictly separated. Most new musical resources are found
as creative consequences of rethinking existing musics, and new models can
often refresh our ways of listening to or performing music. Modeling new
compositions on historical models - as is done in most theory courses - is
a perfectly reasonable and useful exercise so long as the student is aware
that the technique in hand for the exercise is but one of several
possibilities for imitating the model, and that the student is encouraged
to explore as many techniques as possible. 

Someone has said that theorists fall into ''lumpers'' and ''splitters'':
those that look for grand schemes that explain everything in one fell swoop
and those who seek as many alternative explainations as possible. I fall
firmly into the latter category, as I feel it better fits with my
experience of music as one constantly changing with my own perspective and
with the richness of the musical materials themselves.
