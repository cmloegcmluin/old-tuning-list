Saturday, December 12th at 8pm
Bad Girrls Studios

I will be performing with Mad Duxx, an improvisational space-music
ensemble featuring me on microtonal guitar and keyboards, "Chicken"
David Allen didjeridu, "Phonetic" Brett Barbaro on Roland groovebox, and
Gabriel Jones on saxophone, normal guitar, etc. There will be two
opening acts (including Gabriel's own music) and the evening will begin
with a "radio orchestra" jam for which all audience members are
encouraged to bring a portable radio. Admission is $5, $4 if you bring a
radio.
