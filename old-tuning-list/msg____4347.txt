I don't know about the Korg 05R/W, or the Korg DW-6000, but I do know about the midi specs and the Yamaha DX7. 
The original Yamaha DX7 played on one midi channel at a time. Pitch bend is a channel message, which means it 
affects all notes sounding on the channel at once. This means that the original DX7 can only play monophonic 
microtonality using the pitch bend technique. If you use a midi module capable of playing on multiple midi 
channels at once, rather than the DX7, you can play polyphonic microtonality by sending each note and its 
associated pitch bend to a separate channel. 
 
The second generation Yamaha DX7-II of course does microtonality without pitch bend, with each of the 128 
midi notes being independantly tunable across the same wide range (IOW, the pitches don't have to be ordered 
low to high).
