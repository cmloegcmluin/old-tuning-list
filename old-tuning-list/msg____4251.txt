I think what Adam is pointing out is that a composer's instrumental chops
(which, I believe is what Neil focussed on in his post) are much more
fundamental to certain types of music than others. Neil's focus in his
post, while I may be slightly more sympathetic to it than Adam, still
betrays a bias towards certain styles.

Not every composer of good music has been a virtuoso, or even good,
performer. In these days of sequencing and computer composition, there are
certain styles in which the composer does not have to be a performer at
all. Perhaps you don't like music written this way, but I've heard a lot of
good CDs that included no live performance.

It's possible I misread Neil's post, and, as Gary implies, it should be
extended to include "compositional virtuosity," not just instrumental. But
if that's the case, then his post amounts to little more than "Why don't
you people write better music?" Hardly a helpful way to spend bandwidth.
