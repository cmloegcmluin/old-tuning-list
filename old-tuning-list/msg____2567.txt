Yes, there is a quality of sound emanating from close contact with equal 
divisions of the octave that is perceiveable, distinct from scales and 
issues like major and minor.  
As all word used in describing music come from other semantic fields, so too 
does mood.  Perhaps we might use the term "feel" but then others might 
object since it has a different meaning in a jazz context.

I believe so, having discussed it with him and having read his writings.
Ivor credited the anxiety of our age in large part to 12-ET. :)

The Brandenburgs in question are in Werckmeister III tuning and they are 
performed by Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra on Erato.  I 
play them every Christmas Day on the radio in NYC and the reaction is 
truly powerful...lots of telephone calls!
