Subject: New Scala version

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl

Scala version 1.3 for PC is now online, the location is:

ftp://byrd.math.uga.edu/pub/music/dx7/scales/scala.zip

The original location
ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/pc/scala/scala.zip
has currently still the old version; I depend on Dave Madole to update it.

Scala is a very complete freeware editor/librarian/analysis tool for
tunings. It allows scales to be created, manipulated and combined in
many different ways. A large library of scales is available for it. It
can tune various different synthesizers and samplers via standard
MIDI-files. To install, unpack scala.zip in an empty directory and
read the readme file. People who haven't used it can also read the file
first.txt.

Version 1.3 is an update with about 15% more functionality than 1.2.
To name some of its many new features:

- With the EXAMPLE command you can now create xenharmonic MIDI files,
taking another MIDI file as input. Pitch bend commands will be
inserted using the available MIDI channels for different notes. As
long as not too many different notes sound at the same time, this
method works for any tuning. So you can take some MIDI files from the
net or off some cd-rom, retune them ad libitum and hear them on a
soundcard or synthesizer. You can also filter out program and
controller messages. The mapping between note numbers and scale degrees
is customisable.
At http://www.prs.net/midi.html are the Classical MIDI Archives.
I have tried several of John Sankey's Bach files. They are already in a
well-temperament but can be retuned just the same.
- The ANSI.SYS screen driver is no longer required so it works fine
under Win 95 and NT too.
- The ECHO command can now be used with lexical functions returning
pitch data to a string in various formats.
- The new LATTICE/DIAMOND command shows a Partch diamond diagramme.
- The new BISTEP command makes a least squares fitting of a scale with two
step sizes to another scale.
- SHOW COMBINATION shows which combination of intervals from a given
set form a given interval by addition or subtraction.
- SET NOTATION allows a choice of different notation systems. For instance
if 31-tone ET chosen, those note names are given with SHOW SCALE.
- The new AVERAGE command changes a scale by taking a moving average of
the pitches.
- A few other new commands are: SIEVE, RECTANGLE, MORPH, CPS/CORNER,
ASSUME.
- More items were added to the SHOW commands, like SHOW DATA and SHOW
SETTINGS.
- More mode names were added to the list of modes, now more than 600.
- More command files were added, a list is in file cmdlist.txt.

There is one backward-incompatible change, the TEMPERAMENT command
was removed. Instead there is a command file, temper.cmd, which
does exactly the same. And TEMPERAMENT/VARIED is now PYTHAGOREAN/VARIED.

A large library of scale files of all kinds in Scala format can be
downloaded from
ftp://byrd.math.uga.edu/pub/music/dx7/scales/scales.zip (newest version)
ftp://ella.mills/edu/ccm/tuning/software/scales/scales.zip (not up-to-date)
