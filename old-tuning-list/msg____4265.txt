   I suspect that that's a misinterpretation of Neil's appeal.  In particular, I
don't see that he's advocating any particular style of music over any other.
Here's what I think he's pointing out, and I believe quite accurately and
appropriately:  Technical, improvisational, and compositional skill of the sort
that comes only with untold hours and hours of practice, has a VERY big effect
upon the excitement of the music that comes of it.  

   And that, I believe quite firmly, is true of ALMOST every style of music.  

   As I think I mentioned, I've taken up the saxophone recently, with my nominal
goal being to improve my WX-11-based MIDI sequencing skills.  There can be no
doubt that the skills I lost over several years of composing and theorizing
instead of performing, have taken a really serious (although not fatal) toll on
the quality of my music.  And I see that it has on other xenharmonikers' music
as well.  For example:
1.  I have to perform a passage for the sequencer, often twelve or more 
    times before I get it right.  The result, when the sequencer glues 
    together all of the pieces, is too mechanistic, because by about the fifth 
    take, all of the sponteneity and vivaciousness in the performance is gone.
2.  Lacking technical capability on an instrument, makes it very difficult to
    conjure up music on the instrument (in those cases where you compose at
    the instrument that is).  The results very often sound contrived or
    haphazard.  
3.  Lack of really solid background in ear-training in a new tuning makes it 
    very difficult to reliably devise instrumental parts to a larger work, like
    devising accompaniment parts to fill in harmony, or accurately notating 
    melodies conjured up in your head.  This is clearly important even in 
    traditional tunings as well of course, but it's even more difficult to hunt
    for food in an alien landscape than in your own back yard.  (Xenharmonic
    Ear Training is one area where I am probably better off than average, but
    that's largely because the average, or at least the standard, is not 
    nearly high enough.  Or that's my opinion anyway.)

   Now I say that virtuosity is valuable to "almost" every style of music,
because I suppose that if you actually WANT to express a feeling of rigidity and
clumsiness, then I guess you would actually benefit from lack of virtuosity.
But rigidity and clumsiness are certainly a very limited realm of expression.
