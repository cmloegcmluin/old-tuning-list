Aha!  3:5:7:9 harmonies for Pierce-Bohlen.  Excellent.  I've been wondering
for a long time, but never had the time to sit down and crank out, what ratio
approximations Pierce-Bohlen makes available.  Thanks for pointing that out,
John.  

   That makes sense in light of Brian M's observation that Pierce-Bohlen is
essentially every fifth step of 41TET, and that 88CET is essentially every third
step.  That of course means that 3 PB steps ~= 5 88CET steps, which is a pretty
good approximation to 9:7 (checko).  And 6 PB steps ~= 10 88CET steps, which is
a good approximation to 5:3 (checko again).  

   Oh, by the way, the corresponding harmonic series fragment for 88CET is
4:6:7:9:10:11:15.  And as with Pierce-Bohlen's 3:5:7:9 fragment John mentioned,
it can be taken in retrograde to form a subharmonic series fragment.  

   One very valuable difference that falls out of those two harmonic series
fragments is that 88CET has a 10:7 tritone, whereas Pierce-Bohlen has a 7:5
tritone.  I personally have always liked 7:5 better than 10:7, although that's
kind of like saying that I carrots more than potatoes.  They both have value in
their own right.  

   Sorry to keep prattling on about 88CET, or even more importantly, to relate
an observation about Pierce-Bohlen, to 88CET as though 88CET were some sort of
universal tuning reference.  I blabber about 88CET because it's my current
"thing".  But anyway, a number of you have experimented with both tunings, so I
thought some of you might find that relationship interesting.
