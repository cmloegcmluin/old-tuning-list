Subject: Re: What do you play?

From: Steven  Rezsutek <rezsutek@doghouse.hq.nasa.gov>

Well...

I'm using "play" rather loosely here, as I'm still working on
some basic techniques, but my current micro instruments are...  ;-)

My two basses (my "babies" :) consist of a 5 string electric fretless
(soon to sport a high C) and a 4 string acoustic upright, though I
won't play that in front of anyone yet.

My current collection of guitars are: Temporary Guitar (a cheapo
classical with glued on wire frets) and a cheap strat clone in 22tet,
soon to be redone to clean up my mistakes (and practice my lutherie
semi-skills).

I also have a 22 tone keyboard, construction of which was described
on the list, connected to an Emu Classic Keys, though I don't play it,
but just use it as a learning aid.  That may change, though --
necessity is a powerful motivator.

I've got two projects lined up at the moment, which are to convert
my 12tet fretted bass (4 string), and another guitar which I just
picked up (Epi "Dot" -- happy birthday to me :) to 22 as well.

I should have some form of sampling/digital manipulation ability
shortly, and I also have a hammered dulcimer, but I don't even pretend
to play that... ;-)

That's what I've got for now.

Steve
