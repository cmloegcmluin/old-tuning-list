1. I feel that the field of instrument design is pretty stagnant.  Not that
it's ever been better in the past -- who cares? -- but compared to what it
could be.

2. HOWEVER!  Certain people seem to be making the assumption that certain
woodwind and brass instruments are designed to play in 12 equal.  This is
not the case.  (If they were, the designer's didn't do so hot).

3. There's also been talk that the virtuosi of these instruments can play
them in alternate tunings, but who wants to pay for one or spend years
becoming one?

4. In truth, it takes a helluva player to play them in 12 equal.  And it
also takes a fixed-pitch instrument for them to play along with.  And even
then they most often don't play in 12 equal, and why would they want to?
Temperament only makes sense (if we're talking about paradigms) on
fixed-pitched instruments-> that's how and why it was invented.

5. It is harder to play free-pitch instruments in equal temperaments than it
is in Just Intonation, as an amazingly true general rule.  And there's not
many cases when you'd want an instrument designed to play temperaments.
That's not to say they shouldn't exist.  But certainly not as an improvement
over what we've got.

6. It's just plain hard to control the intonation of woodwinds and brass at
all.  "Good Intonation" is the holy grail of conservatory training.

7. So why are we stuck in 12?  BECAUSE OUR FIXED-PITCH INSTRUMENTS ARE STUCK
IN 12.  If there was a keyboard that played in JI, certain people would be
amazed at the overgrowth of ensembles playing in JI.

8. Wait!  According to the above, we ought to already have a number
ensembles playing in JI, as long as they were made of free-pitched
instruments and had good players at the helms!

9. We do.  But it's crappy JI.  A good fixed-pitch instrument tuned to JI
could get 'em to play stuff they would never play otherwise.

10. So build me a good keyboard!

Carl
