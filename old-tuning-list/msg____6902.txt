Subject: Small mistake, Quantum take

This appeared at the bottom of my last post, "Re: Tuning Digest 1285".  What
didn't appear there was my reply...

The invention of a new particle is just a way to treat a group of properties
in Quantum mechanics.  You can model nine-geese-a-laying in Quantum
Mechanics if you come up with a particle for it.

..as it seems to have been forgotten in the clipboard.

Einstein's reality principle?

Granted.

Give me a break!  Everything is an approximation -- Quantum Mechanics too.
One that doesn't, by the way, provide many corrections on the macroscopic
level, where the "classical way" is so dreadfully approximate.

Right.

Huh?

But it makes sense to talk about having the *same* pitch set for horizontal
and vertical sonorities?  I quote from your post on Friday December 12th, to
Tuning Digest #1264...

>You can't deny that most Western music derives much of its beauty and

..and now, back to yesterday's...

True.  But this doesn't take away from the fact that there is one line of
notes heard, without a doubt, as "the" melody, being backup up with chords.
Go get the 1974 YES album, "Relayer", and listen to the second track from
time index 5.30 to 6.15 for an excellent example of melody and harmony
coming from different pitch sets.

This concept is very important in Barbershop, which is, by definition,
melody being backed up with chords.  The melody is usually sung in something
roughly close to 12-tone Pythagorean (3-limit), while the notes used for the
chords fit almost exactly in the 7-limit.

Granted.  Most all classical music has elements of contrapuntalness.
There's quite a bit in the midi files on my web page.

Aha!  Thanks!  I was looking at your post with the asci diagrams, and I
agree that the diagonals work much better than a square grid (as in the JI
Primer).  I was looking at the two D's, and realized that 3(P5)+(min3) =
4(P5)-(Maj3) is not true for temperaments without a consistent 5-limit
triad.  In your 20TET example...

(36 + 5) /= (48 - 6)

So you would simply say the syntonic comma is not well defined?  Cool.
Working on your septimal comma stuff...

John Chalmers has said...

Where to get Bosanquet's original work?  Erv recommended his book
"Temperament" but it is out of print.

How are you going to have a standing wave in the universe?  Wouldn't it have
to be a higher-dimentional wave?  That is, if you look thru the strongest
telescope, do you see the back of your head?
