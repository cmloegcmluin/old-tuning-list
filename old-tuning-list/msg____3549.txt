Subject: Babies and tuning

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

A story in the newspaper yesterday tells that babies do not like out
of tune synthesizer music. Psychologists of the Harvard University
have discovered that babies of four months and older know when music
does not sound good. 16 Boys and 16 girls were tested and they avert
their ears or start to cry with false notes. They didn't do that when
the music was not out of tune. The results were published in Nature
magazine.
