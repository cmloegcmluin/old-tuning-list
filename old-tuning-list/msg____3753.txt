Subject: skips in sound and video

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

All-
	In response to my own post on mysterious glitches in playback of 
.wav files, video or animation, if you experience this problem in windows 
3.x or windows 95, try disabling auto insert notification for the CD and 
CDR drives. In windows 95 (I forget where it is in windows 3.x) go to 
control panel, system, device manager, CDROM, settings, and there it is, 
the offending checked box. All auto insert notification does (besides 
screw up your audio playback) is allow your CD player to automatically 
play audio CDs upon insertion, and allow automatic start for some CDROMs 
upon insertion.
