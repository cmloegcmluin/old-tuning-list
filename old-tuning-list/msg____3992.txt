Subject: Brian's Rant

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Brian-
	That's some mighty big talk, mister. You'd better do something good, 
really good. I mean reeeeeeeeally good to back up them thar words.
	 First of all, you did not find all of the microtonal related websites,
no matter how perfect your four hour search. Your blanket statement that 
none of the forum subscribers but Manuel has anything but trash to offer 
is ridiculous and insulting. You, Brian have contributed nothing but a 
bitter complaint, equivalent to a teenager whining that "the word sucks 
and it looks like I'll have to fix everything myself".  
	Secondly, why should everyone who mentions microtonal music have as his 
life's goal putting together a web site that is exactly the thing Brian Mclaren 
wants to see?
	Thirdish, sound files are not, I repeat, NOT a waste of time. So 
what if it takes a few minutes to download? So what if the sound is not 
CD quality? How else is the novice goung to hear what microtonality is 
about? Hearing is believing. Dry words about tuning do not conjure up the 
sound for most people.
	Finally, I like Brian (never met him). I like passionate people. 
They are interesting, but sometimes a pain in the ass. When one of them 
explodes all over his friends, neighbors and enemies alike, one expects 
that is for a good reason, and one expects changes will then occur. 
Since Brian has thrown down the gauntlet in his own court, and with such 
force, I expect nothing short of perfection, and soon.
