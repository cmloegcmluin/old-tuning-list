I'm afraid that I do not hear it as a dissonance. There are several
historical reasons why the fourth was treated as a dissonance, but I think
one is that the systems of common-practice counterpoint used "dissonance"
interchangeably with "tension." Certainly this is not the case, and
something Babbitt I think fails to represent accurately in his zeal to
expose the arbitrary nature of common-practice counterpoint rules.

Can you have tension in tonal music without dissonance? Clearly so.
Dunstable and some other early 15th century composers wrote very beautiful
music with few or no dissonances, yet the music seems to me to have tension
and release about it.

Because the fifth of the chord is on the bottom, the 6/4 chord is not as
stable as the 5/3. Some theorists say this is because the 3rd harmonic of
the lowest note forms a dissonance with the other two notes of the triad.
There may be something to that, but of course Bach never thought of it that
way. It is easier to think of it as 6/4 "resolving" to 5/3, the same way
5/4 would resolve to 5/3.

In the second example, commonly a suspension, the fourth is not the
dissonance -- the dissonance is the second between the upper two voices.
However, because of the historical preoccupation with judging intervals
always in reference to the lowest sounding voice, it was simpler to call
the fourth a dissonance.

There is always a certain amount of arbitrariness in any musical system.
That's why it's art. However, music also has a basis in how we hear and the
physics of sound. Certainly some people, such as Hindemith, have oversold
this side of art in their misguided desire to make their style appear more
in keeping with "natural laws" and less artificial. (Brian has, on
occasion, and unfairly, I think, accused a wide range of JI composers of
this very error.)

Musical styles are created as a way of manipulating the physics and
perception of sound towards artistic ends. Babbitt's arguments against the
artificiality of the tonal system is ultimately pointless, I think, not to
mention the pot calling the kettle black.

Brian's vitriolic attack on Babbitt (besides beating a dead horse, as
someone else has pointed out), goes too far in his search for hyperbole. To
indict the man's musical education and knowledge in such strong terms
requires much more evidence than his lack of explicit differentiation
between sensory and musical perception of consonance and dissonance.

Perhaps it is because Brian sees Babbitt as one of the high priests of
academic music theory, which I don't think is really accurate anymore.
Certainly there are those people still around who enjoy nothing more than
pushing around numbers in sets ("Babbittry" was Greg Taylor's colorful
term), but, generally speaking, the heyday of that sort of thing is long
gone.

I will not deny that the popularity of this kind of theory among academics
was out of proportion with its historical importance, probably because of
the appeal of such a complex yet readily quantifiable type of analysis. Nor
will I try to claim that tuning issues are well-represented in the academic
press. However, Brian's own welcome bibliographies should serve as evidence
that there is no conscious Babbitt-led conspiracy against these issues.

On a related note: though I don't share many of John Cage's philosophical
viewpoints, I don't think it's fair to call him a charlatan. A charlatan is
someone with pretensions, someone who misrepresents what they are doing.
John Cage was upfront about exactly what he did and did not do. If you did
not want to call him a composer or what he did music, that was fine with
him.

And to see Cage as a high priest of academia is even further removed from
reality than in the case of Babbitt. I think that many academics did not
accept Cage for a long time. The reasons are obvious: How do you evaluate
chance music? How can you construct an objective theory about it? In that
sense, Cage was about as un-academic as they come, and I for one am
grateful for his breaking down some of the preconceptions and prejudices in
academia and the arts in general.
