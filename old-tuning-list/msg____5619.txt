Close. More exact, however: Heinz Bohlen considers difference tones to be
just first order combination tones. So what he really believes is that
combination tones are the "foundation of all harmony" (thanks for that nice
expression, Paul!). And if he lives long enough he might one fine day be
going to prove it...
Slightly deviating from Paul E, and more in tune with Daniel Wolf, he also
believes that beats (like distant harmonics) add flavor to sounds (and thus
have "musical significance) but are of no harmonical importance.

(By the way, if somebody is interested enough in combination tones to try his
(her) German on Helmholtz, he (she) might find the following source even more
yielding regarding this specific issue: Husmann, H., Vom Wesen der Konsonanz.
Mueller-Thiergarten-Verlag, Heidelberg 1953.)
