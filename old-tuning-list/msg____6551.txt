   A darker line instead of a blank one sounds like an intriguing
alternative.  My immediate guess would be that the missing line would stand
out more, and would have a lower possibility of changing half-notes on the
line into quarter notes!  But still that thought is well worth exploring.

   Colored lines would almost certainly stand out better than missing or
dark ones.  The drawbacks:  I would think would be that it's a bit more
difficult to copy colored lines than purely black-and-white images, and
that far more people are color-blind than most of us realize (luckily I'm
not).

   Without a doubt you're right there.  Making one staff line distinctive
in some way (e.g., colored or missing) makes the clef you're in a lot
easier to remember than having to look back to the beginning of the line.
It's kind of like painting the clef throughout the entire staff line!


   Along similar lines to both of these, I have often wished for a computer
sequencer that allows me to view and print instrument transpositions by
staff-line color.  For example, Bb instruments could be given ... brown say
.. staff lines, Eb instruments, perhaps green, and so forth.  And on top
of that, having the note-head colors suggest entire octave displacements.
So, for example, a guitar (since it transposes down an octave) would have,
say blue notes (octave down transposition) on a black staff (no sub-octave
transposition).  Or a bass clarinet or tenor saxophone would have blue
notes (octave down transposition) on brown staff lines (Bb transposition).
That makes it a lot easier, as you're thumbing through an orchestra or band
score, to quickly figure out what the concert pitches are among the sea of
lines and notes.
