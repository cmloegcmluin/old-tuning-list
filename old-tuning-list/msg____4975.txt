The bible has both "in the beginning was the word" and also "let there
be light".  If the substance of the universe, the aether, is taken as a
medium then the speed of sound in the aether is what we know as light
The aether is very high tensile stuff).  So these two statements are in
agreement.

It is true as Neil says that ancient knowledge and religions are all
similar in describing the universe.  Pythagoras (who is, I suppose, the
patron saint of tuning) of course also described things in greater depth
in the same way.  While we may see the ancient knowledge as poetic
rather than scientific, my research has turned out to be mainly
rediscovery as I have realised that lots of the stuff has been known
before.  Even the numbers that I get for the strongest harmonics, ...
144, 288, 1440, 2880, 8640, 17280, 34560 ... are to be found in ancient
religious documents, often with a few extra noughts on.  The bible has
144,000 and the Vedic literature is full of these numbers.
The only thing is that people have forgotten what they mean.

The three most important harmonic relationships are those involving 2, 3
and 5.  When we include one, two or three of these we can view the most
important ratios as follows...

A. We know 2 as the octave and it is so important that we call different
notes at a ratio of 2 by the same name.

B. According to the harmonics theory, the primes 2 and 3 like to occur
with a relative commonness (I avoid frequency as ambiguous) of 2.38 to 1
and so this is most nearly approximated by the numbers 12 and 24 which
have 2 or 3 "2"s present for 1 "3".  Again, 288 has a near correct
proportion.  Therefore these ratios should be important in both time and
space.

C. When 5 is also added the ideal proportion happens most nearly for 
2^8 * 3^3 * 5^1 or 34560 although 2880 is also important.  These results
are all 100% mathematical and based soley on that tiny basic program I
posted.

If we look at the universe what do we find?  Starting from the largest
scale, the observable universe is about 10 billion light years in
radius.  Division of this by 34560 repeatedly gives us the following
values for distances ...

Table of ratios of 34560 from the Observable Universe

N	10^28 cm    	Feature 	Common Units
   / 34560^N

0	1*10^28 cm  	Universe	10^10 light years
1	2.9*10^23 cm	Galaxies	3*10^5 light years
2	8.8*10^18 cm	Stars		8.9 light years
3	2.4*10^14 cm	Planets		16 a. u.
4	7.0*10^9 cm 	Moons		70,000 km
5	2.0*10^5 cm 	X?			2 km
6	5.9 cm      	Y?			5.9 cm
7	1.7*10^-4 cm	Cells		1.7 microns	
8	4.9*10^-9 cm	Atoms		0.49 Angstrom
9	1.4*10^-13 cm	Nucleons	1.4 fm
10	4.0*10^-18 cm   Quarks

What we find is that the observed structures do match the scales
predicted.  We see the universe as galaxies, stars, planets... and atoms
and particles.  The predicted values for the atom and nucleon are quite
accurate as the observed Bohr radius is 0.53 angstrom and the observed
nucleon radius is 1.3 fm.  The X and Y scales are not so noticable.
However there are some anomolous phenomena at these scales (or slightly
smaller, about 1.7 km/1 mile and 5 cm/2 inches).

Quark size has not yet been established but is less than 10^-17 cm and
so they are almost to the next level that I predict.

Also, within each level there are expected to be multiple sublevels at
ratios of mostly 12 or 24 but sometimes 20 or 28.  This is also
observed.  Above galaxies we have the weker level of galactic clusters
and small irregular galaxies are found at distances of 1/12 of the large
spirals (these are the small hangers on to the andromeda galaxy and out
own magellanic clouds that look so nice in our southern skies).

Again, planets come in two sizes and distance scales.  The gas giants
are at distances which are ~28 times greater than the terrestrial type
planets from the sun.  The distances of the outer planets are very
nearly in the proportion 1:2:4:6:8 and so includes quite a few ratios of
2 as well.

There are further examples also.
