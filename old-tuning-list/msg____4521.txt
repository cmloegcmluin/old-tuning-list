Subject: strings and things

From: William Sethares <sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu>

The problem of figuring out the partials that will sound when a 
nonuniform string is plucked is dealt with in 

Kalotas and Lee, ``Transverse modes of a string with variable mass 
density", Acustica Vol 76 (1992).

This paper provides a matrix method that allows you to segment the 
string into sections, each with its own properties, and to then 
calculate the partials of the complete system. Thus, for Gary's twist 
tie string, you could divide the string into three parts, (regular string 
on left and right, twist tie version in middle) and use Kalotas' 
method. 

However, the inverse problem is far more interesting from a musical 
perspective: define a desired set of partials, and find a string with 
contour so as to generate the desired partials. Unfortunately, this 
inverse problem is as yet unsolved. 

On a slightly different topic, Glen said: I can't imagine the air 
conducting the sound from one string to the other.

I believe that sympathetic strings do indeed work by transferring 
the energy through the air. As a simple experiment, sing into a string 
on a guitar, and you can easily set the string to vibrating 
(sympathetically) with your voice.
