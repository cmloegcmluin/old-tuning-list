The psychoacoustic effect I claim? Do I sense another deliberate 
misunderstanding? What I claimed was that the minor triad was not considered 
stable enough to serve as a final chord until its tuning became standardized 
near 16:19:24. The major triad is still more stable in any tuning, so the 
picardy third is appropriate in any tuning. My claim is that ending a 
_tonal_ piece of music with a long, sustained minor tonic chord did not 
become a convincing compositional gesture until composers heard 16:19:24 
minor triads. Note that a Pythagorean minor triad is just as good as a 
12-equal one for approximating 16:19:24, so there is no need to enter the 
debate about well-temperament vs. equal temperament.

Well, if the historical evidence proves me wrong, so be it, but my ears tell 
me quite clearly which note is the root of a 19:16 interval, while a 6:5 
interval has a different effect. Minor tonics tuned to just 10:12:15 or 
meantone just don't work for me, while ET or Pythagorean minor tonics work 
fine.
