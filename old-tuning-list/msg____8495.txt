Subject: Looking for advice

From: siforte@ix.netcom.com

Hi,

I'm currently running a PPC 603e (Mac).

I would like recommendations on the best cards and/or synths and/or
software for doing alternate tunings. I'm looking for something that is
relatively easy to use as I'm a beginner in these waters.

Thanks in advance,
Sanford

PS - Is there a tuning editor for the Roland JV 880?
