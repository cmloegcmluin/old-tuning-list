It's not important for the same reasons, of course, but "not important"
(at all) is overstating the case a bit, I think.  Consistency level of
high ETs can still provide useful information--in Margo's case, for
example, a synth whose internal ET had a consistency level greater than
or equal to 12 at the 3-limit (as 1024 does) would require no
nanotempering at all for most Pythagorean scales.
