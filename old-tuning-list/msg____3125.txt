I've been interested in exactly the same question, except for the 
tuning-dump aspect. Apparantly, the Ensoniq EPS would qualify, but it's been 
out of production for a couple of years. I went to a music store, and the 
salespeople I talked to pointed me to Korg, which makes marvelous 
synthesizers with amazingly realistic timbres (it's been a long time since I 
played with synthesizers). It has only one programmable tuning, where each 
of the twelve notes can be detuned  100 cents. The meager selection of 
internal tunings does not even include meantone.

However, I found a way to get the $700 Korg to do 22tet in the store. I set 
the programmable tuning to a "pythagorean tuning" based on 709-cent fifths. 
I then split the five-octave keyboard in the middle, and transposed the 
bottom half up two and a half acoustical octaves. This gave me two and a 
half octaves of 22tet, with a few redundant notes. I bet the next people who 
tried out the keyboard were annoyed! Hopefully, I can hook up my roommate's 
Yamaha DX as a slave via MIDI and have five octaves of 22tet. (?)

I want to hear what others have to say on this question before I make the 
purchase. Although 22tet is my main interest, and should be easily 
realizable on a guitar (my main instrument), I'd love to be able to play 
with tunings more freely than the Korg allows, if at all possible.

Thanks,
Paul Erlich
