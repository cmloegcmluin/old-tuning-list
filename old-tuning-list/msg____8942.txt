Subject: Monzo in Philly

From: monz@juno.com (Joseph L Monzo)

Just wanted to leave a note that I have
returned to Philadelphia for a few days to
take care of business.

I have email access at my usual account if
anyone needs to contact me, but I will not
be using it regularly.

Updating of the Tuning Dictionary and the
Tuning Digest Archives will be suspended
until I return to Sonic Arts, approximately
mid-December.
