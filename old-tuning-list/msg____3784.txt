Subject: Tempered Fifths

From: John Chalmers <non12@deltanet.com>

Re Manuel's post on beat rates:  Needless to say, I was somewhat
surprised by Manuel's recent post. However, I have been unable
to find any errors in my values for tempered fifths. I have taken
each of my fifths and computed the beat rates for the P5,P4, TM,
Tm, SxM and Sxm and my values are equal when they should be and
Manuel's are not for the cases I've had time to examine. 

I presume the problem lies in our algorithms as the errors are for the
most part in the 4th and higher significant figures. I used a commercial 
Math package (circa 1987) and the Newton-Raphson method to solve the 
4th and higher order polynomial equations for the values of the 
temperers. These equations were based on Rasch's formulae, but I checked 
the beat 
rates with my own formulae based on the lowest common partials. So,
I'm puzzled.
