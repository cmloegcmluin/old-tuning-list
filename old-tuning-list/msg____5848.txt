Subject: Limits

From: "Paul H. Erlich" <PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com>

Thanks to John Chalmers for the reminder on Partch's terminology. It
appears that the concept that I've been referring to as "odd-limit" is
fully consistent with Partch's term "identity", while Partch's usage of
the term "limit" was not restricted to this definition. In the future,
then, I will use the term "identity", despite the association with "1"
that that term might have elsewhere. Then "limit" can be used to mean
"prime limit," as would suit the needs of JI composers sorting out pitch
materials, who seem to have a plurality in this digest over those more
interested in using the term for consonance/dissonance issues.
