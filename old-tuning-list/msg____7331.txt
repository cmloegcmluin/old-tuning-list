>
>   They have 66 groups of exercises.  Here they are categorized by general

>
>Transposition, Pseudokeys and Pseudokey Signatures:
>- "Repeat after me the upward circle of fifths"
>- "I'll list a note, and you tell me the notes one and two fifths
>  above it."
>- "Repeat after me the pseudokey signatures of the various sharp-
>  based pseudokeys"
>- "I'll list a pseudokey and you tell me the pseudokey signature."
>- The analogous above four exercises for the downward circle of
>  fifths and flat-based pseudokey signatures.
>- "Tell me the pseudokey signatures and then, one-by-one, the notes
>  of the ascending pseudodiatonic scales."
>- Preview of singing 7:4 ratios (because 88CET pseudodiatonic scales
>  repeat in 7:4s).  Listening exercise, then singing (with correct
>  note name).
>- "Sing along with the following pseudodiatonic scales."
>
>Interval-Hearing:
>- "Minor wholetones."  Listening, then singing.
>- Subminor thirds:  Pairs of naturals that are a subminor third
>  apart (once you memorize the naturals, it's easy to extrapolate
>  the sharps and flats).
>- Subminor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then
>  descending, with correct note name.
>- Supramajor thirds:  Usage in pseudodiatonic scale.  Key indepen-
>  dent (by scale-step number), then by naturals.  First repeating
>  them as stated on tape, then quizzing.
>- Supramajor thirds:  Listening, then singing them, ascending then
>  descending, with correct note name.
>- Neutral thirds:  Same as done with supramajor thirds.
>- Operating within a pseudokey framework:  "[an A sounds] This is
>  scale step 1. [tone changes to C]  This interval is [pause for
>  answer] subminor, so this is step [pause for answer] 3."  This
>  is repeated for other thirds within pseudokey framework,
>  occasionally injecting a note that does not fit within the
>  pseudokey.
>- A brief stint with perfect fifths - a sing-along.
>
>A Quick Break from Interval-Hearing:
>- 7 general rules stated for memorization, and then a quiz about them.
>
>Interval-Hearing Continued:
>- Tritones:  Same exercises as done above with supramajor thirds.
>- Three exercises in distinguishing supramajor thirds, tritones and
>  minor sixths.  (This is one of my weird, nonsensical hang-ups:
>  somehow I sometimes get these three intervals confused.)
>  - Listen to supramajor thirds.
>  - Listen to some minor sixths.
>  - Play various supramajor thirds, tritones, and minor sixths, and
>    I am to identify them.  Occasionally inject a major sixth or
>    off-fourth interval.
