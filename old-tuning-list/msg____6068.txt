There is neither a direct interpretation of 1 sruti. To quote from
Arnold A. Bake, "Bharata's experiment with two vinas", in _Bulletin of
the School of Oriental and African Studies_ vol. 20, 1957, pp. 61-67.
He rejects the idea of mathematical calculation of the pramana sruti
(1 sruti): "The name pramanasruti really has no reference to the
mathematical size of that interval, contrary to what was accepted a
priori by Fox Strangways and others. What the name is meant to
indicate is that one has to take that sruti as the standard, because
it is the only one actually demonstrable in practice by putting the
ma-grama against the sa-grama as indicated. The sum total of 22 srutis
is arrived at by addition, not by division." ... "There is no evidence
of the ancient Indian musicians arriving at the perfect octave, fifth
or fourth by division of strings."

B. Breloer by the way calculates different srutis than Fox Strangways.
In "Die Grundelemente der altindischen Musik nach dem
Bharatiya-natya-sastra", Bonn, 1922, he gives srutis of 24, 66 and
90 cents (instead of 22, 70 and 90).
