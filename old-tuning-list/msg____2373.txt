   Far be it from me to question a truly excellent composer-performer-producer
like Johnny Reinhard, but I've never equated microtonality with anything as
general as mastering improvisation in absense of an agreed pitch standard.  It
seems like it has to be more specific than that, involving new musical sounds
stemming from fundamentally nontraditional pitch relationships.  I find it hard
to conceive of any nontraditional pitch relationships in Bach's work.  That
especially since, ever since Mendelsohn, Bach's music (the Chorales especially)
has been the very vehicle of teaching musical tradition.  

   I personally (and others I know as well) take the term "microtones" to be far
more specific than that:  a generalization of the concept that originally
emerged under the name "quartertones".  

   But I certainly don't claim to be a great authority on Music History.
