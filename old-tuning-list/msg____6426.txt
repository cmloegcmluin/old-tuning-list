Thanks.  I would love to recieve something about what you're doing -
but yes, it is outside the scope of what I can concievably spend much
time on at this point.  My home address is 97, Onley Street, Norwich,
NR2 2EA, UK if what you might send doesn't fit in a virtual post box.

Do you really think this is true, Johnny? Firstly, let me say, I am
not a woodwind player (I studied oboe as a kid).  But I know very
well the amazing things that some virtuoso contemporary wind players
can do these days - whether it's Ferneyhough, Nono, Holliger etc.,
for quarter-tone stuff, or more radical (from a tuning point of view
at least) such as Ian Grietzer's playing of Sim's 72-ET quintet, or
31-ET, or whatever.   (I have the manuals from your  Pitch No4 of
course).

However, I do  see great value in  building new instruments.   New
physical design, placing of tone-holes, fingering (possibly greatly
simplified with electronic interfaces for purely acoustic
instruments) etc would give a more accurate pallette, (ie designedly
'centred' pitches), improved tonal charateristics, and greatly
improved facility.  For example, fast scale passages in n-ET (ie.,
non-12-ET) would be audibly improved;  orchestral players, who are
not virtuosi, would be able to play n-ET or n-JI, thus integrating
the exploration of ATS somewhat deeper into the musical fabric... And
new extended techniques will doubtless be explored too...

> Oboe:  If the musical ear hears the relationship, the oboe is quite obediant.

But, would it be preferable to have an instrument that that actually
confirms the scale in the ear and mind of the performer, rather than
one which is 'quite obedient'?

Let me put it another way.  Suppose that Western music had evolved
such that, today, 19-ET was the standard to which woodwinds (and all
other fixed or semi-pitched) were built.  (Leave aside for a moment
whether this is a legitimate hypothesis).  Then some crazies come
along and say "Hey man, we wanna play music in 12-ET - it sounds real
good!"  And then, the most brilliant, spend years struggling with
playing this darned 12-ET thing on their 19-ET instruments...

Sure, 12-ET and 19-ET have special similarities, that's why the story
sounds vaguely plausible.  But they are just similarities.  To really
realise these things in all the beauty and clarity we hear in very
good performances of works in conventional tuning.... well, IMHO, we
are (in general) way off, so far...  However, of course, I have yet
to get over to NY and come and hear you guys and girls.

PS.  Does AFFM have some CDs out which will help me learn the error
of my ways?
