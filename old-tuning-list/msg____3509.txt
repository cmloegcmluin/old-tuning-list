Subject: Re: JI versus eq temp

My thoughts on this subject, for what they are worth...

Well, as someone who repairs and retunes harmonica for a variety of people
(from beginners to professionals), the overwhelming majority prefer JI. In
fact, there have been numerous times when someone has bought an brand-new
off-the-shelf harp of the equal-tuned variety and brought to me to "fix",
because it's "out of tune"! However, the same people then get very confused
when they play with a pianist and their 7/4 sounds way out, compared to the
piano's 1000c.

I guess I feel I shouldn't agree with this, but can't help it. Much as I
prefer (and come to prefer more and more) the richness of my JI harps, in a
jamming situation, my first choice of instrument is a 12TET harp in the
appropriate key. Having said this, I wonder how often I (or anyone else with
an instrument capable of variable intonation) actually play in ET?
Typically, my blues playing features a lot of neutral thirds and slightly
flatted fifths.

My copy of "Sensations Of Tone" is out on loan at them moment, but I seem to
remember that Helmholtz found tendencies towards Pythagorean intonation
amomgst violinists - are there any other studies in this field?
