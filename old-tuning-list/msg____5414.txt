Subject: Indian music

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

My office keeping skills are minimal, so I'll have to paraphrase this 
next phrase rather than quote it. It's from a book called "Sonic Design," 
and I'm afraid I don't know the author. When referring to Indian tunings, 
they demonstrated with a 27 note to the octave scale, rather than the 
usual 22 srutis I am used to seeing. Then, they pointed out that each 
note was more of an "area", rather than a "fixed pitch"...the performer 
was at liberty to use several different "notes" to express the mood of 
the raga he/she was playing. This makes perfect sense to me...notation is 
a tricky affair at times, and in many cases, such as bending a note, 
there is absolutely NO way to tell a person where to put that note, since 
it is a matter of feeling and expression...and, this, of course, is where 
real music differs from theory. 
    I've been playing blues for 30 years, and it is impossible to tell 
someone where to play a pitch when they bend; you have to DO it; yet, I 
know when it's wrong, and so do my students. Again, it's a feeling. I 
truly believe that only the practitioners of a style of music are 
qualified to be authorities on what makes it tick. That's why there is so 
much speculation on Indian tunings by westerners, but little 
authoritative knowledge...many western theorists do not actually play 
Indian music, so they're approaching it as outsiders. To me, the concept 
of no final "pitch" for a note is a lot like so called "quantum" theory, 
where only probabilities are certain, and our own participation in 
looking for an electron can affect where it turns up. Again, all 
improvised music is like this, to some extent. Even though flamenco, for 
example, is in 12 eq, no one can tell you what to play next on your 
instrument, so notation is only showing you what happened at that 
particular time; next time, you'll play something else. Each style is a 
language, deep and unique. To live it is to speak it truthfully.
    Again, I would love to see more great music in our field. There's an 
awful lot of great 12 eq musicians out there, and I am hoping that the 
folks who actually play instruments in other tunings will develop their 
playing and composing skills to the highest possible level. Most people 
in the world just look at you funny when you say "microtonal," so I 
believe our work is just beginning. Yet, with powerful, profound music to 
back up our theories, I am convinced we can help people hear that we are 
on to something valid, and worthwhile. That's why microdoodling bugs me 
so much; I'd much rather hear someone play their ass off in 12 eq than to 
poot around in a rudimentary way on an instrument, trying to convince me 
that "just" (pure) tunings are "superior" because they are better in 
tune. As the level of musicianship rises in other tuning systems, things 
will improve. Until then, a lot of folks think that microtonal music is 
just a bunch of bleeps and bloops, made by guys at big universities with 
white coats...Hstick
