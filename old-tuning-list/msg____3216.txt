Subject: Barbershop

From: John Starrett <jstarret@tiger.cudenver.edu>

Ladies and Gentlemen-
	I have had a request to supply more info on barbershop music. 
The full correct name of the organization is "The Society for the 
Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America "
and the compilations of each years winning quartets is available on the 
ProArte label. I own two of these, "Coney Island Baby" from 1990 and "Old 
Mill Stream" from 1991. Some of these groups sing "justly" and without 
much vibrato.

Subject: Ratios to cents
Message-ID: <199607140053.AA25094@felix.dircon.co.uk>

To convert ratios to cents I use this little program in GWBasic. It's so
simple it should be translatable into other dialects of Basic without
difficulty.

10 Print "Input the numerator and denominator of the ratio"
20 Print "and this program will give the cent value"
30 Print
40 Print "numerator": Input A
50 Print "denominator": Input B
60 Let R = A/B
70 Let C = 1200 * LOG(R)/LOG(2)
80 Print "cent value of ratio" A"/"B "is" C

What it does is divide the logarithm of the ratio by the logarithm of
2(because it's an octave) then multiplies by 1200 for the number of cents to
the octave.

If you want to use Yamaha tuning units instead of cents just replace the
1200 by 1024.
