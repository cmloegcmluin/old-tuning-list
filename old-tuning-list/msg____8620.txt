>Music and the Power of Sound : The Influence of Tuning and Interval on
Consciouness
>by Alain Danielou

This is interesting stuff. How much research has been done on this subject
matter? Is the impact of tuning and interval cultural? I have often wondered,
and still am wondering, what is the overall purpose of this list; that is, is
there anything socially functional about these endeavors or are they just
intellectual endeavors? I read of people doing performances using non-standard
tunings, and wondered what were the results they expected from the audience.
Besides for entertainment purposes music originally has been used as a  tool for
focusing thought or creating synergy among a group of people with the purpose of
accomplishing or realizing something that can not be accomplished by the
individual.

I have a friend who is actually using the concepts of sound to as a tool in drug
treatment programs. He said to reprogram the mind one has to be in complete
control of the stimuli (the program) that enters the
five senses.  Although his results are positive, the "established" community
suspect it since it conform to their models.

Sorry if I rambled but I'm rally am interested in how some of you are making
your understanding of this subject matter socially functional. I will also pass
the sunject information to my friend
