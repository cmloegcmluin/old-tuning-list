>>>i.e., a major seventh is just as dissonant/complex as a major
>>>sixth.

   Although I certainly respect that as an opinion, I'm amazed that anybody
would feel that way.

   If by dissonant you mean the commonplace (but technically not correct)
meaning of "discordant", then I'd say that there's no comparison;  to my
ears, a M6 sounds every bit as "sweet" as a major third, whereas a M7
sounds very jarring.  Of course that's all at least somewhat dependent upon
timbre.

   If by dissonant you mean the more traditional (but less common) meaning
of "less resovlved within a keyframe", the I'd say that the contrast is
even more extreme, since any seventh chord in traditional harmony is
regarded as a dissonance.
