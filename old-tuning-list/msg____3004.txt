Haverstick here...to Paul E...yes, now's the time to call someone
with experience in the field of refretting...hope it works out for
you.
On composition...in the liner notes to Kazuhito Yamashita's CD of the
Bach Cello Suites (on guitar), he says "As Segovia and Casals showed
through their own work, one's ultimate aim
must be to attain the ability to express something of universal signifi-
cance through one's performance"...indeed, this could not have been
stated better...this is just the quality that I feel makes any sort of
art "great"...and it's damn for sure that very few folks ever reach 
this place. The ones that do are very worth of respect and emulation.
I will try and attain those lofty levels until they cart me out of here.
Also, Brian's comments about Partch's hard times are well taken...he
certainly did get ignored by the "establishment" folks, but he also
had it a lot better than Crazy Horse, who got murdered by the govern-
ment for trying to defend his people. Of course, CH wasn't a micro-
tonal musician, but I bet the white folks didn't like Indian music much
better than they liked Partch's music...come to think of it, has anyone
out there done any research on Native American music? It sure doesn't
sound like it's in 12/eq.
One more thing...when Brian talked about how hard it is to get through
Partch's "Bitter Music" (which I have never heard), he hit something
right on the head for me...much of the Partch I have heard (which is
not a lot, to be sure) does have a quality on the emotional level
which is not appealing to me...it does not contain, for me, that
"universal significance" just mentioned...it is "hard" to listen to.
On the other hand, I really dig Charles Ives, who certainly is not
"easy" to listen to...but, I feel something totally different off
of Ives than I do Partch. Perhaps, too, this difficult music of
Partch's is one reason (only one) why folks didn't take too kindly
to him when he was alive...most folks don't want to work too hard
when it comes to music listening, and that's a fact. 
To quote my lovely daughter Neela once again; we were listening to
US HIGHBALL once, and I asked her opinion...she said it "sounds like
creepy spiders or something"...since I did not have the honor of
ever hanging with Partch, I cannot say what kind of man he was...I
do get the feeling, however, from the small sample of his music that
I have heard, that there might have been some internal problems which
he was dealing with...his music sounds troubled and anguished at
times...and it is only natural, of course, that these things would
show up in his music...
Back to Bach...I truly feel that Yamashita's version of JS's Solo
Violin Sonatas and Partitas is a great accomplishment, on any instru-
ment in any genre at any time period...it truly blows my mind right
out of the door...I cannot believe he did it, and put so much deep
feeling into it as well...the guy's a bad MOFO...Hstick
