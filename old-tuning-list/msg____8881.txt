Subject: subharmonic scale

From: "Collins" <collinsclan@sprintmail.com>

I am new to this list and have been doing a bit of lurking around, but today
i read a post from Joe Monzo who mentioned the Subharmonic scale. This scale
sounds very interesting to me...but i have absolutely no information on it.
Does anyone possibly have any info they can e-mail (or snail) to me? I would
really appreciate it.
Thank you.
