Subject: Historical?

From: A440A@aol.com

After signing on  this list, I have observed that non-traditional
tunings are the major topic.
    
        Is this perhaps the wrong place to find those interested in
restoration of 16th-19th century keyboard tuning practises for the music that
was composed during that period?
       In non-cyber space, (i.e., real time world of stages, recording
studios, musicians studios, etc.)  I find more interest in the historical
concept of "The Character of the Keys",  than in any of the new
extrapolations of what JI is and means.  
      There is a lot to be learned from hearing Chopin's preludes from Op. 28
played on a DeMorgan Temperament, but if this list is the wrong place to find
those interested, would y'all kindly fire up the flame throwers and melt the
message in the snow.

Thanks,
