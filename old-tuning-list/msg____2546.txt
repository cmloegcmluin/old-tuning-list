Last evening I had the pleasure of attending the Composers Guild of New 
Jersey performance at New York University.  3 of the 5 
composer/performers were microtonalists.

Paul Gallagher sang in just intonation based on a C fundamental and never 
deviated.  The accompaning tape of his "The Kingdom of Mescal" (based on a 
Mayan story of a young man's quest for vision and knowledge) utilized 
Opcode's sequencer, Vision, to control the Ensoniq EPS16+ sampler, the 
Alesis D4 percussion module, and the Yamaha DX7IIFD synthesizer.  Mary 
Platt provided excellent stage direction.

Having presented Paul's work on the AFMM, it was quite entertaining to 
see him "moving" corporeally in his music, rather as a stick figure 
recitalist.  The 20 minute work was roundly entertaining.  The JI was 
most apparent in the taped music, for Paul's standard even vibrato seemed 
to camaflage its pedigree. 

Pete Rose the virtuoso recorderist presented several of his 
improvisation/compositions.  SNSI with soprano and sopranino recorders 
played simultaneously emphasizes beating, glissando effects, an 
micro-relationships of sound.  "Palindrome Over the Low Notes" and "Rapid 
Shave" allowed for singing in combination with tenor and alto recorders, 
respectively, to finish the set.  Pete does not usually indicated exact 
microtonal fingerings in his set pieces, preferring jazz forms and 
humor.  However, he is most capable in written works of this kind by 
other composers.

Virginia Johnston's "Sojourns" contained what sounded like 1/8th tone 
passages (if they were indeed measured) in the context of a trio for 
flute, bassoon, and clarinet (played by the composer).  Ms. Johnston 4th 
movement "Tale" begins with "mesmerizing clarinet microtones" [from the 
program notes] and begins an interplay with the flute and bassoon.  
Seasoned musician composers like Gallagher and Rose are an unfair 
comparison to a recent graduate, but if Ms. Johnston can break out of 
academic constraints - like matching already existing styles of composing 
so that she can truly find her own voice - then we look forward to her 
next and latest.

Thanks go to Dinu Ghezzu who with the NYU Composers Forum presents this 
collaboration with the the Composers Guild of New York - now in its 15th 
year.  Robert Pollack chairs the NJ group and though he is a pianist, he 
has truly worked to present an exciting array of concert music.
