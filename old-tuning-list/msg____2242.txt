Subject: RE: Herbert Anton Kellner's Bach tuning

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Kirnberger never claimed that JS Bach prohibited Pythagorean thirds, only 
through a third party that JS Bach tuned all of his thirds sharp (which I 
take to mean sharper than just and not necessarily sharped the same amount).
