Don't these occur far more often (in non-contrived physical situations)
that any other maps? (Clearly, a subjective question.)

Right. It is 4.6692 . . . only for the unimodal, finite second
derivative maps that seem to occur most often. It is -2.8336 . . . for
the Fibonacci cascade of the zero-slope cubic nonlinearity, for example.

I would love to learn more about this. Was this period tripling sequence
(presumably meaning a trifurcation cascade) discovered by accident, or
was the pendulum specifically rigged to produce it?
