Subject: Paris Microtonality

From: Johnny Reinhard <reinhard@styx.ios.com>

Having just returned from the European Varese premiere of Graphs and Time 
in Paris I thought it pressing to share an amazing realization:

Just Intonation and l'intonation juste are false cognates

The French term refers to playing traditional tuning (i.e. 12 ET) in 
tune.  There are "spectral" composers such as Grisey, Risset, and Murail who 
round out overtone relationships to the nearest quartertone and eighthtone.
But the concept of a 5/4 just third is completely absent from both 
practice _and_ theory.

Good friends - quite well known musicians all - finally got through to me 
that they have never understood me on previous occassions.

That said, several composers have now begun breaking down the whole tone 
into 16th tones (called 16ths music) following the influence of 
Carrillo (incl. Alain Bancquart, Pascale Criton, Fernand Vandenbogaerde).

Alain Bancquart has prepared a piano room at the Paris 
Conservatoire (newly built building) which contains to beautiful grands a 
quartertone apart, the original 16th tone piano upright made by Carrillo 
(formerly in Nice, France), a third tone piano, and a "mirror" tuned 
quartertone piano which integrates quartertones in the order 3/4 tones, 
1/4 tone, etc.  

Publisher/Composer Gad Barnea (Editions Europeenes) is leading the way to JT 
as we know it but it is pioneering work.  Iannis Xenakis brings in more of the 
sound spectrum than others, as does his former student Pascal Dusapin, 
and the Varese premiere has ignited a whole new focus 
on "The Liberation of Sound" (the name of Varese's monograph which is 
most exemplified by my performance of the Graphs and Time conducting the 
Ensemble 2e2m.  The 8-member ensemble members had never improvised before 
(except for the horn, tuba, and percussion).  Its director Paul Mefano - 
also a composer using quartertones and glissandi 
regularly - favors large works with microtones galore, but up till now, 
only those of 1/4 and  1/8 tones.  The concert at the Pompidou Center 
Great Hall included microtonalists Doinia Rotaru of Romania and Drake 
Mabry the oboist/composer, all within the strictures of exact 1/4's 1/8/s 
and glissandi.

Now I understand why Le Monde dismissed performances of Harry Partch 
without the original percussion instruments performed by the AFMM years 
ago in Nice, which they never actually attended: it is only through the 
"sound sculpture" instruments that Partch was reduceable to music.  For 
France, Partch's monophonic fabric in its precision of relationships is 
not constituted in music theory.  For them there are 9 commas in an equal 
tempered whole tone and nothing more.  Ideas anyone on improving the JI 
climate?
