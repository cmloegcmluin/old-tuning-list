   The picture on the web page shows the remaining fragment to be fairly
short, so it would be difficult to really tell.  It's probably fair to say
though that presumably all they did was hollow out the marrow from the
bone, so it was probably largely cylindrical

   By the way, that "calibration-curve"-based procedure I described is not
how I did my science fair flutes.  But it probably is one of the easiest
ways to do it.  And yes, when using this procedure, the calibration tube
must have all other aspects of its essential geometry identical with the
final instrument, including the shape and size of the bore.
