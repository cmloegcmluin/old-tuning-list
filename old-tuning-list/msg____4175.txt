Woensdag 4 december, Conzertzender, 22.30 - 23.00:
220 Volt. Compositions from CCRMA of the Stanford University.

1. Chris Chafe - Quadro, for pianotrio and tape
2. Allan Schindler - Tremor of night and day, for cello and tape
3. Jonathan Berger - Diptych, for string quartet, soprano and tape
4. Dexter Morrill - Quartet, for violin, cello and two loudspeakers

Schindler's "Tremor of night and day" is one of the most beautiful
microtonal works that I know.
The title and much of the general atmosphere and expression is
inspired by "The Outermost House" written by Henry Breston, diaries
with reflections and observations of sea- and landscapes. 
It was composed in 1984 for and in cooperation with cellist Robert
Sylvester. The electronic part consists of synthetic
computer-generated sounds and transformed acoustical sounds like
whisper and noises of pots and kettles. 

Allan Schindler teaches composition at the Eastman School of Music. 
(Is this an American institute? Hey, then maybe another school less
that lacks Brian's good detwelvulating seal of approval...)
