Subject: a "lurker" decides to speak his mind

From: Adam Fine <bj009@freenet.toronto.on.ca>

Hi there... This message is merely in response to a message asking
quiet subscribers such as myself to speak up. Well, I'm a high-school
student in Toronto with a rather expansive taste in music and a powerful
obsession for musical theory. What better a place to read up on the
avant-garde than here! Up until now, I've been quitly trying to take in
what information I can understand, and any relevant WWW links, live music
listings or discography that apply. But today I read this lengthy,
loquacious and rather hypocritical "essay" by Brian McLaren, and am
suddenly inspired to speak out against such self-justifying crap. Just a
few comments:
        Perhaps he should reread his words, and make sure that he doesn't
contradict himself. His commentary on Aristotle and authoritative
knowledge contradict his quoting of Aristotle and other authorities within his
writing.
        He lacks a sense of redundancy; he writes long essays whose length is
only justified by the repetition of his ideas over and over again. Once an idea
has been proven (or just commented upon in McLaren's case) let it go and move
on unless there is more to say.
        If he really hates university so much, than why does he so often speak
against ignorance? Mr. McLaren, no one is forcing you to go; I am rather
looking forward to the advancing of my musical knowledge.

        ...and I thought I was pretentious. With people like McLaren around, I
have nothing to worry about.

	Besides my criticisms, I would like to know a little bit about 
reccomended recordings to start me off. (I have heard only the slightest 
bit of JI and non12 tunings) I am aware of the recordings out there, but 
I assume individuals who are interested in the music can pick better 
music than I ever could picking random productions from a list.

Thanks for letting me listen in.
