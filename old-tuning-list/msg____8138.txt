Subject: Re: Patent Alert - Microsoft owns computer composition?

From: "Benjamin Tubb" <brtubb@cybertron.com>

I noticed the patent creator is Todor Fay. For those who don't already know. He
is the programmer of the former Blue Ribbon Soundworks products who sold
"Melody Maestro", "Audio Tracks Pro", "Sound Track Express" and SuperJAM!" and
prior to PC development, worked on the Amiga with "Bars&Pipes Pro",
"PatchMeister" and "SuperJAM!" Prior to working with Blue Ribbon, he programmed
the sequencer "SoundScape". In short, his musical programming background and
development over the years makes him imminently qualified for getting a patent
regardless of his current affiliation with Microsoft whose "Music Producer" is
their latest product similar to the former "Audio Tracks Pro" program.
