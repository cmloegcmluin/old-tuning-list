Subject: Pierce-Bohlen in JI, 12-tone scales

From: "John H. Chalmers" <non12@cyber.net>

It is rather difficult to generate a consistent JI for
the 9-tone Pierce scale in JI. Using the matrix Pierce gives
of four 1/1 5/3 7/3 major chords (3:5:7) and reduction by the 3/1 
"tritave" (rather than the 2/1 octave), one obtains the following 
ratios:
 
V	IX	III		
		III	VII	I
			VI	I	IV
					IV	VIII	II
 
27/49	45/49	9/7
		9/7	15/7	1/1(3/1)
			9/5	1/1	7/5
					7/5	7/3	49/15
 
Note the equivalence between 1/1 as the dominant of one chord
and the mediant of the next rather than tonic (VII is not VI).
When reduced to one "tritave," the ratios are 1/1 49/45 9/7 7/5 
81/49 9/5 15/7 7/3 135/49 3/1. Alternate tunings for some tones are 
needed in some harmonic contexts, i.e,  5/3 for 81/49, 25/9 for 135/49, 
35/27 for 9/7 etc. However, the scale is best construed as a subset 
of the 13th root of 3 temperament and hence has many just intonation
interpretations.
 
As for the 12-tone chromatic scale, the so-called  "Pythagorean" 
or 3-limit cycle of 4ths and/or 5ths tuning can be traced back to 
the Babylonians in the 2nd millennium BCE, though some Chinese 
legends credit a court official whose title was Ling Lun with an even 
earlier date. 
 
There are many 5-limit chromatic tunings; I posted a couple of
dozen to the list earlier) and also published them in 1/1. 
J. Murray Barbour's book Tuning and Temperament is a good
source for the historical western ones and Mandelbaum's
dissertation for some more theoretical and 7-limit varieties.
