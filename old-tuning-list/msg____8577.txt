Ed:

I like the comment on beat phenomenon and airplane
engines out of synch.

I have heard that a major fallacy of the Germans in WWII was their
staunch refusal to synchronize their bombers' engines.

The result, of course, was that beats could be heard halfway 
around the world! Thus always signalling the planes' arrival!
