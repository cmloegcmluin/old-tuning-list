The open strings are supposed to have the best tone possible, which a
grooved piece of bone is more likely to acheive than a true 0th fret. On
the acoustic guitar I love the sound of open strings and use them as
much as possible, while on the electric guitar I could care less. Also,
some players (like me) like the "feel" of higher action, and the nut
contributes to that feel as much as the bridge.

Yes, about +/- 2 cents, according to Steve Vai. Buzz's system is a
compromise of a compromise, but less compromised than a normal guitar.
