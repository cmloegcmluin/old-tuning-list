Thanks John for explaining the method for calculating beats.
I realise where my blunder was. I had better read Rasch's article!
I took the difference frequency between the just and the tempered
interval for the beat rate. But it's not that but the partials in
the octaves above that beat. So the value I gave for equal beating
major third and fifth is in fact for the major third beating twice as
fast as the fifth, and where it was twice it's in reality four times
as fast.
The last two ones labeled "other one" were an attempt to get the
solution for the case with beating in the opposite direction as John
demonstrated. 
Hopefully having it right now are these the values for equal beating
major third and fifth for the positive schismatic mean-tone temperament: 
Equal: 701.7278   Opposite: 701.6910
