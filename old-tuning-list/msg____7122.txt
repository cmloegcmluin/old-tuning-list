     Thanks Bill for the excellent suggestion.  I repeated some of the
experiments using that method with a sine wave voice, and agree it is
in fact a more reliable and sensitive technique.  All pitch changes
that had been detected by the overtone method were confirmed as real
by the reference tone technique, but in addition some new pitch
differences were revealed that had escaped detection before.  In
general the qualitative conclusions reached earlier were confirmed.

    The reference tone method made it possible to tighten up the
quantitative estimates for the Sound Canvas (Roland SC-55mkII).  It
appears that when set at a pitch bend range of +/-1, the Sound Canvas
has a pitch bend resolution of 8 bits everywhere except in the pitch
bend region from 8065 to 8319, where instead of the expected three
pitch changes there are none at all.  The beat count shows that the
omission is not compensated for by a correspondingly larger pitch
change across that region.  This would appear to be a design flaw.  If
so it is an unfortunate one for microtonalists, because it introduces
a gratuitous additional error of 2.34 cents into intervals whose end
points are tuned by pitch bends of opposite sign (8192 being
equivalent to a pitch bend of zero).  If it were not for this
aberration, Sound Canvas owners would enjoy a maximum error of
resolution of 0.78 cents.  Another unit that I tested (Fatar GS 1000R)
did not exhibit this peculiar behavior.

      Thanks also to John Loffink for his clarifying remarks, among
them:

This being so we would do well to report to John anything new about
the resolution of particular models that we discover by
experimentation, so that he can (if willing) post the information on
his useful web site (http://freeweb.pdq.net/jloffink/default.htm).
