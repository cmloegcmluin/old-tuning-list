Thank you very much!  My diatonic steel has a 24.5 inch scale, but I'm sure
I can do the math from here.

The frets of a steel guitar are simply painted guides.  It's not common to
play open strings along with "fretted" (barred) ones.  Open strings are
generally used as a special effect.  The difference in timbre makes them
unusable in most passages.

Steel guitarists slant the bar slightly to compensate for the different
intonation of low strings at the higher frets.  Most steel guitarists aren't
even aware that they do this - it is a natural movement of the left hand.
Beginning steel guitarists sometimes compensate too much, and must learn to
straighten the bar at the high frets to the proper degree to make the
instrument sound "in tune".
