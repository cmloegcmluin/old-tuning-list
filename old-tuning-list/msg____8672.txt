Well, now that I live on the west coast it's easy
for me to agree with that.  In fact, San Diego would
be even better!

Seriously, I think LA is a good place, if only for
the fact that Erv Wilson lives there and that would
make it easier for him to attend.

Again, any microtonalists passing thru San Diego
are invited to contact us and get involved in Sonic
Arts.  There's a lot going on microtonally in
Southern California.
