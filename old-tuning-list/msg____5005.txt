Grr! OK, PE's is now redefined (for the third time) to have a perfect fifth 
of 720 cents and a major third whose error is exactly equal in magnitude and 
opposite in sign to that of 15-equal. There. Now tell me that this isn't a 
glaring counterexample to judging triadic consonance by looking at perfect 
fifths and major thirds only!

By the way, if we want to take these sum squared errors and interpret them 
as measures of consonance, we should divide by the number of terms in the 
sum to obtain a mean squared error, then divide by twice the squared 
tolerance of the ear, and exponentiate the negative of that result (in case 
you didn't get it, that's a normal distribution model, normalized to give a 
value of one for just intonation). The tolerance of the ear is about 1% so 
the squared tolerance is about 300 square cents.

For the case I'm trying to make with the "PE's" tuning, it doesn't matter 
whether you use squared or absolute error. As for preferring sharp 
intervals, presumably this would apply to all intervals as well as their 
inversions, and since we are considering all intervals along with their 
inversions, all such asymmetry will cancel out.

What does it mean to prefer a sharp unison over a flat unison? (that's just 
a joke, but there is a serious (hehe) debate on this topic over on 
rec.music.compose)
