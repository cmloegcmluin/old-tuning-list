Subject: RE: 7:4's mood, and other things

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

I don't have answers to all of Kami Rousseau's questions:

> How do you say "7:4"?? Seven quarters?? Seven four? Seven on four?

Harmonic seventh or perfect seventh. Septie`me parfaite.
By the way, it's best to write a ratio either like 4:7 or 7/4, but
not like 7:4 (unless you mean 4/7).

Aussi cents. Comme "sant"?

> What is the minimum number of degrees to have a octave based scale?

I suppose two, being a pathological case.

I do not think that there is a clear border. Beating gradually
changes into an increasing roughness of tone.

>From an old Guinness book of records: "Children with asthma can often
detect a sound of 30000 cycles per second. It was announced in February
1964 that experiments in the U.S.S.R. had conclusively proved that
oscillations as high as 200000 cycles per second can be heard if the
oscillator is pressed against the skull."
