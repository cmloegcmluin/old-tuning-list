It's a name clash.
There is no relationship between the sites or the
organizations.  Your reference is to an organization
in England, ours is in San Diego, California.

The Sonic Arts Gallery
(http://www.ixpres.com/interval/gallery.html)
has been in operation in San Diego since 1987,
owned by Jonathan and Elizabeth Glasier.

When Denny Genovese and I happened to move to
San Diego at the same time last month, we both
got involved in Jonathan's work at the Gallery,
and together we formed an organization that just
took over the name Jonathan had already been using
for the Gallery: the Sonic Arts Center for Microtonal
and Just-Intonation Music in Southern California.

The name was originally inspired by the idea that
musicians who wanted to create new sounds (and
tunings) by building their own instruments, were
also creating visual art in the design of their
instruments.

"Any resemblance to other persons living or dead
is purely coincidental".
