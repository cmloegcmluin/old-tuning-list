Subject: SCALA: Help with help.

From: pbrewis@cix.compulink.co.uk (Peter Brewis)

Having subscribed to this wonderful list for a year and a half I've 
finally got around to trying to work with some non-12tet tunings. I did 
have some quarter-tone pieces of mine performed years ago when I was at 
the Royal College, and still shudder when I recall overhearing someone in 
the audience ask his neighbour, 'Have they finished tuning up yet?' (As a 
matter of fact _I_ wasn't sure whether they had or not.)

I'm tying to get to grips with Scala and I wondered if someone might be 
able to tell me why, when I type 'help' it says, 'Help is available for 
the following items:' That's all it says. There _are_ no following items. 
I've also tried 'help append', 'help intersect' and so on. What am I 
doing wrong? What a terrific piece of work Scala is, by the way.
