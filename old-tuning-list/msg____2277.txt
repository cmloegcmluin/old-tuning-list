Subject: More about n-j n-e-t scales
---
"As physicians have always their instruments
and knives ready for cases which suddenly
require their skill, so you must have principles ready
for the understanding of things..." [Marcus
Aurelius, "Meditations"]
Because of the general lack of incomprehension
and puzzlement at my mention of non-just non-
equal-tempered scales, it's clear that some
further info is required. 
In general, I'm not talking about linear or
meantone tunings.  While it's true that these
are technically non-just non-equal-tempered
scales, most of 'em are just one or another
way of bending twelve tones to obtain a
more consonant third or fifth in a traditional
Western triad.  This surely has its value,
but meantone scales decidely represent the
outermost extreme conservative  side
of non-just non-equal-tempered scales.
Instead, the kind of n-j n-e-t tunings I'm
concerned with--and have been since the
git-go--are those tunings which break
completely with the Western mold.  Some
of these kinds of tunings have octaves, others
don't.  In general, they're so wildly foreign
to any conventional harmonic or scalar 
vocabulary that there is hardly any intelligible
way to talk about such scales as yet, except
as raw numbers.
For example:
One of the simplest ways of generating such
a completely non-Western non-just non-equal-
tempered scale is by taking the natural logarithm of
the factorial of a set of integers:
1! = 1, ln(1) = 0
2! = 2, ln(2) = 0.693147
3! = 6, ln(6) = 1.7181759
4! = 24, ln(24) = 3.17805383
5! = 125, ln(125) =  4.82831373
6! = 720, ln(720) = 6.5792512
7! = 5040, ln(5040) = 8.52516136
and so on.
Taking ratios so as to eliminate
dependence on the base of the logarithm,
we have:
scale step 1: 1.0
scale step 2:  2.478808
scale step 3:  4.5849625
scale step 4:  6.9657842
scale step 5:  9.4918531
scale step 6:  12.299208
These values can be octave-reduced or not.
If not, the scale will have no octaves.  
If octave-reduced, carrying out the procedure
will produce ever larger numbers of scale-
steps within the octave, never overlapping.
This is an inherently fractal process, first
described by Thorwald Kornerup in his Golden
Section scale.
In a sense the procedure is analagous to
that of just intonation, in which successive
addition and subtraction of various small-
integer-ratio intervals produces an ever-larger
profusion of unequal divisions of the octave. 
However, there are a number of differences.
At this point it's useful to introduce the
concept of the "inharmonic series."  By
analogy with the harmonic series, an
inharmonic series serves as the backbone
of a non-just non-equal-tempered scale.
In this case, the inharmonic series is 
Log(N!) where N runs from 1...infinity.
Of course choosing N by some other criterion
(perhaps by some recurrence relation: say,
N4 = N1 - sqrt(N2 + N3^2)*N1) would produce
an entirely different inharmonic series.  There
are an infinite number of inharmonic series,
each generated by choosing N by a different
method and then applying some non-linear
operation to N.
By contrast, the familiar harmonic series is
obtained by setting N = the class of integers
and performing the simplest possible linear
operation on them--namely, the unary
operation (which leaves the operand unchanged).
Inharmnic series are important as a source
of modulation and of vertical structures
in non-just non-equal-tempered scales.
One of the most interesting implications
of non-just non-equal-tempered tunings,
however, is the prospect of generating
a scale of note durations (read: rhythms)
derived from the scale steps, by analogy
with the comparable procedure in traditional
Western music.
