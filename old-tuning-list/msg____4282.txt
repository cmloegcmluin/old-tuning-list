Subject: Re: Hello

From: Matt Nathan <mattn@ix.netcom.com>

I'm new to the tuning list, but not to the exploration of pitch, and wanted to say hello and that I'll be 
reading along. 

I was wondering also if anybody knows the email addresses of either of theses people:
1) Dudley Duncan 
2) Glen Frantz 

My opinion on the wolves v. wolfs subject is this: 
 
The term "wolves" is inappropriate in a musical context. It's a special word reserved for the plural of 
certain animals. A comparative illustration is found in the words "lice" (insect parasites) and "louses" 
(dispicable persons). You wouldn't call entrenched politicians "lice". Well, maybe you would. :)

The plural of wolf tone (in the context of an unwanted resonance in the body of an acoustic instrument) is 
wolf tones. The plural of wolf interval (in the context of the aesthetic effect caused by not having enough 
pitches on an instrument or in a tuning system, and misusing the closest available pitches as surrogates) is 
wolf intervals. If either of these plurals must be compressed into one word, the logical choice is "wolfs".
