Actually, I only think of Blackwood's 19-tone works as so-so.  It's the
15-tone stuff that really makes the alubum.  The etude (track 7, methinks)
is AWESOME.  It's the kind of finely-crafted composition you're not going
to get from Darreg.  The guitar suite is somehow traditional and trippy at
the same time.  But man, that dominant makes me WINCE!

As Gary pointed out, the performance of Ivor's music suffered on many
levels from lack of money.  I think the best stuff he probably played live.
 Denny reports that he could play the meanest 19 and 17 tone blues on
guitar.  I have the entire Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier, and the best
track is actually on Detwelvulate.  It is in 51.  It's famous for the
trill, which is very cool indeed, but the thematic material is actually
very interesting, and it can be heard under the trill.  Another great
Darreg work is the prelude in 19 found at John Starrett's microtonal page.

Doh!  I checked it in 12, but used 51 cents off for the 11/8 out of pure
mistake (51 - 4 = 43).  Okay, so you need consistency.

Wow.

I agree that we only want one way to approximate something in an equal
tuning, as long as we're using equal tuning to approximate.  But I do not
agree that the 1% rule determines which things are one.

You lost me.  Are you agreeing with me?

No, I don't think that.  And I don't think that the sound of a triad will
submit to being predicted by such rules as "3/2 is more important in major
than minor triad".  All I can say is that the combinations of mistuning in
the 19-tone major triad produce a different result than the combinations of
mistuning in the 19-tone minor triad.

That is, I think that the results of mistuning depend upon the type of
interval (nothing new here), the amount of mistuning (duh), the direction
of mistuning (I think you disagree with this), and all of the above on any
other interval you combine with it.  I believe that the results of
mistuning depend on the combination of these factors such that none of them
are any good alone.

I'm not trying to be fancy.  I'm just trying to describe what I hear.
