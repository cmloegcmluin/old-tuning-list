As I was reviewing Mark Lindley's article on Pythagorean intonation in the 
1980 Groves Dictionary Music, the concluding sentence, which I'll quote 
here, caught my eye: "But even though all sophisticated Western composers 
and performers since the Renaissance have taken for granted the use of 
tempered tuning on normal keyboard instruments, Pythagorean 
intonation has persisted in the West as a rustic or provincial practice." 
The slightly modified Pythagorean tuning of the piano in Tomsk, with 
most of the wolf spread over the fifths Bb to F and F to C may be 
a present day example of this practice.
