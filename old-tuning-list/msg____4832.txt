It's interesting to note the the ones using roots
still use ratios as the interval for which a root
is found. Most often, the ratio for which roots
are found is 2:1, but not always.

I think there are more categories. 

What about equal temperaments of transcendental numbers (the most 
abundant numbers), which are neither ratios nor roots of ratios?

What about "modulated equal temperaments"? These would be
pitch sets which are sort of like equal temperaments but 
which vary in step size along the "scale" according to a given
curve. For example, using a sine curve, the widths would 
cycle from narrow to wide and back again as you move up the 
"scale". I think either a slanted line or a log scale applied 
to a modulated equal temperament would produce an harmonic 
series.

What about sets of "found" pitches--pitches which are determined 
randomly or from some natural data (like stock prices). I read
a neat post in the archives, but lost it again, which described
how someone would find the most comfortable finger positions for
a wood flute before drilling the holes. That determined the 
pitch set for the instrument, for which music was then composed.

There are conceivably as many pitch set categories as there are
categories of numbers and number sets. I suspect, as John Starret 
here wrote, that "...we may be hardwired for mathematical 
understanding of all that we can understand mathematically, and 
that may spill over into musical understanding...". I think we
can perceive different qualities in pitch sets derived by 
different mathematical means, given that the instrument has 
good enough resolution to distinguish them and that the actual 
pitch differences are large enough to fall above the threshold 
of perception.
