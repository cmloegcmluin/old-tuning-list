   Speaking for myself, I see a lot of value in systematizing tuning.  

   Operating within a framework of limitations, and possibilities of course,
stimulates creativity.  Waving a magic wand over every problem we encounter,
rather than solving them by ingeniously combining limited resources within our
grasp, is boring.  

   Also, tuning systems prioritize certain resources over others.  That strongly
affects the results.  The traditional modes within a 12TET framework provide a
close analogy:  The fact that our culture divides 12 otherwise indistinct pitch
classes into 7 meat-and-potatoes pitches with 5 spice pitches has had a strong
effect upon Western music.
