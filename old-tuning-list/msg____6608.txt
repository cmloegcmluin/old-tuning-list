No Indian theorist I've read ever claimed 22 equal has anything
to do with Indian music.  Some mention a 22 note scale, but
most emphasise that it is _not_ equally tempered.

One of the features of traditional Indian thinking is a lack
of historical sense, so everything is considered as the
present and obsolete ideas are not highlighted as such.
South Indian theorists, though, do make a much bigger point
of the 22 srutis.  I haven't seen any quantitative research
on the pitch perception of South Indian musicians.

As there is no modulation in Indian music, 436-cents thirds
will never arise, even if you follow Gregg's highly suspect
argument.
