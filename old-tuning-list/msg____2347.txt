Subject: historical temperaments,modern ears

From: A440A@aol.com

Greetings to all the list, 

        I have been watching this list for a while, and for a first entry
here, would like to know if there are any practising tuners out there that
are using non equal temperaments for modern work. 
       After tuning in Nashville recording studios for the last 18 years,  I
finally convinced a studio owning friend to try a Well temperament,( Young
 1799) on the piano. He heard it once, and declared that he would never go
back to equal temperament.  
       Very interesting responses. The guitar players all love the increased
harmony available in the purer keys. ( actually, any key with less than 4
accidentals). 
       There was one demo session where the singer *had* to sing in F#, and
there was a lot of eyebrows raised;  yes, it did sound out of tune, but the
piano player was not posessed of an 18th century tonal education, so there
was no question of him working within the temperament.
       I have found it very interesting  the way different people register
the difference in sound.  Approx.  30% of the musicians notice the increased
purity in the simpler keys, and approx. the same number notice the increased
dissonance in the more tempered keys, there are some that don't notice
anything until it is pointed out to them, and a very few pianists that
instantly recognize the aural palette and can grasp what effect composers
were, by manipulation of key character, seeking .
      I would really like to hear from anybody else that is currently working
on a temperament crusade,  I really think there is more interest in the topic
than the current dialogue indicates.
