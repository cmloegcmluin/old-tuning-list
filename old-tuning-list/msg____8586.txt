You are correct only with an infinitely long sampling window. The
temporal resolution of the ear is far better than that, on the order of
several milliseconds. Standard signal processing theory says that the
temporal resolution times the frequency resolution is greater than 1 or
2*pi or some such constant. The ear beats this by performing several
layers of processing, which is what I refer to as "nonlinear".
