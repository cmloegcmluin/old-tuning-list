The relevant message came the day I went away briefly, so this reply is a 
bit late.

I read with interest Johnny Reinhard's description of the Toronto concert
he was in recently and related events. The people he performed with (most
of whom are composers also, as he stated) are indeed experienced and
meritorious. I found the concert less interesting as a whole than he did,
although parts were very good. The Tenney influence is right, I suspect,
because so many of the people in the Toronto area know his work or studied
with him. 

The point of this message is that the success of the concert was due in
large measure to Johnny's enlightened and illuminating involvement. I said
so before, but perhaps not "loudly" enough. The "movement" does not have
so many fine performers that we can afford to ignore 'em when we see 'em.
Besides, visits like this to the Toronto area are not frequent, alas.
