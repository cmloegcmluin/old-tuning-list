I think an international association of microtonalists
is a great idea.  Perhaps the seeds of it lie right here
in the Tuning Digest.

One important note about Sonic Arts -- since Los
Angeles is only a few hours drive away, we intend
it to be a gathering place for microtonalists not
just in the San Diego area, but from all of Southern
California.  We welcome all Angelenos to visit
and participate.

Also, although all of us in San Diego who are
involved are interested most in just-intonation,
we have several of Ivor Darreg's equal-tempered
instruments, and don't place intonational restrictions
on our free improvisations (only on what could
be called composed pieces).

We also welcome the Denver and New York
groups to participate if possible.  We've already
talked about how great a cross-country link
would be.  And we have a 19-equal guitar, Niel...
