Subject: 19TET trumpet

From: Kami Rousseau <kami@interlinx.qc.ca>

Hi, 

Here is an interesting question : I dream of having a microtonal
trumpet. A
trumpet that would play third tones. It would be perfect for playing
blues. (Yes, Neil Haverstick inspired me this idea.) Would it be
possible to take a
4-valve A/Bb piccolo horn and modify it like this:

	cents	cents
Valve # 12/oct  19/oct
1       200     126,32
2       100     63,15
3       300     189,47
4       500     252,63

(The big numbers are hundreths of a normal semitone)

Using this set of slides, the fingering would be similar to a regular
trumpet.

Is it possible to cut the valves' tubes to play these higher notes? (for
exemple, on the chart, the 3rd valve lowers the note by a major 2nd,
that is 189 cents.)

The practical difficulty comes in trying to make an even shorter 2nd
valve crook than a piccolo trumpet already has. As you know the 2nd
valve crook is already barely a
half circle. Maybe it would be possible to shorten the valve casings and
try to
get an alternative set of slides.

Also, it would be practical to  find an instrument with a larger casing
than a piccolo.  I have heard of flugel horns out there that have four
valves and would have large enough ports to work better for the project. 

Can any one help me find an instrument suitable for this, and a good
technician to do the job? Is 19 a good choice, or should I go for 17, 22
or JI? Also, can anyone post the latest infos on ordering a microtonal
guitar (with fixed frets)? How do you calculate the frets' positions?

Regards, 
        Kami
