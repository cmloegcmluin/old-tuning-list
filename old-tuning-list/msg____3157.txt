Subject: List in Latin

From: COUL@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

Next to the English (int_names.txt) and Dutch (int_namen.txt) interval
lists, there is now a Latin name list:

ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/int_nomini.txt .

These names are by no means the only ones possible. Various writers in
the past have used all kinds of different nomenclature. Some fantasy
had to be used to come up with a name for some intervals. For example, 
I didn't know what the word for "harmonic" is, if there is yet one, 
so I just took "consonator".
