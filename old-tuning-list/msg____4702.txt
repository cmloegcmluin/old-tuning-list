From: sound@musicworks.web.net (Gayle Young)

Dear Tuning-List-Readers, I am passing on this posting from LMJ, which
specializes in technology and music, thinking some of you would be
interested.

PLEASE POST



LEONARDO MUSIC JOURNAL is searching for an Editor in Chief or a team of
Editors in Chief to shape the editorial direction of the journal and its
World Wide Web site (http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/Leonardo/lmj/sound.html).

Since its inception in 1990, LEONARDO MUSIC JOURNAL has served as a forum
for innovative research in new and experimental music and musical languages,
sound art, the evolution of music and the relationship of music and the
audio arts to new media and technology. The Editor in Chief position is to
be filled by an individual or group with a demonstrably broad and
established base in experimental music and the audio arts who will
strengthen and focus the journal's current role.

This new position is to be part-time and will primarily involve content
solicitation and development. The chosen candidate or candidates may work
from any location in the world, but must be able to work on line and
maintain electronic access independently.

To receive a full Request for Proposals, please email Grace Sullivan at
grace@sfsu.edu.

Gayle Young, editor, Musicworks Magazine
