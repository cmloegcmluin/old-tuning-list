Subject: Tape Swap is like Soyulent Green

From: Denis.Atadan@mvs.udel.edu

The Tape Swap is like Soyulent Green - It's People - IT'S PEOPLE! Now I don't
want to sound like public radio at fund raising time but... I think we need
more contributers to really make this successful. I know that some of you all
already have discs out, however, I hope this doesn't dissuade you from
contributing a bootleg performance or a home recording. And for those of you
that are concerned about the use, distribution or possession of your material
let it be said-

All material submitted remains entirely the property of the composer. All
material will only be duplicated and distributed for those contributing to the
tape swap project. Furthermore, the tapes will not be sold.

I don't have lawyer here so that's the best I can do.

With all that said - don't be shy - send in the music. I mean it's one thing
to tune your synth to all these wild tunings but it's quite another to hear
pieces by those that have been working within a tuning for any length of time.

So that address once again to send your music, your SASE (preferably a padded
envelope), and your 90minute blank tape is ---
