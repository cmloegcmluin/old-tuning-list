Ben's notation uses +/- for a mixture of 3 and 5-limit intervals (dare I
say "see Fonville, 1991?)  Since each symbol or combination of symbols
represents a particular ratio, then an enharmonic spelling is necessarily a
different pitch.

Does your comment refer to a system such as that which is described by S.
Terpstra in 1/1 8:3, which uses a system which sounds to me like an ET with
comma or skhisma-sized scale steps?  If so, could someone please explain
the logic of this system to me?

Johnny's notation is especially good for his own polymicrotonal music,
which pledges allegiance to no system and wanders with ease from one
microtonal system to the next.  However, it does nothing to guide the
performer towards knowledge of what *kinds* of intervals are being played.
For example, in the early performance of his "Cosmic Rays" (I have not
heard the "good" tape), the performers were so steeped in the xenharmonic
aspects of the piece (note: *xen* harmonic) that they failed to well-tune a
major triad--I argue that they didn't know that they were supposed to play
a well-tuned chord.  Nonetheless, this is probably the best compromise for
such music.  It should also take a whole lot of rehearsal to do well, as
does all "performed" microtonal music.

Ben's notation is specifically bent towards a JI ststem which he himself
has stretched to the limit of its practical capabilities.  My suggestion
(for JI music) is to use differing systems of notation for score and parts,
in which Sims or similar diacriticals are used to approximate pitch (with
the rest tuned by ear) for easy sight-reading, and Johnston or something
similar is for the score.  Of course, Johnston notation, as with all
notational systems, should be in a constant state of evolution, and I hope
that discourse such as this will include proposition of better ways to
notate pitches which are far from home on the lattice.
