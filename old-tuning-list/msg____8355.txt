Subject: Re: Nano-temperament

From: Paul Hahn <Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu>

I don't mean to belittle anyone's ideas, and perhaps I've misunderstood
something, but it seems to me that this "nanotempering" is a pretty
obvious thing, really.  It's the natural result of not rounding off to
the granularity of your synth until you've calculated all the pitches
involved as precisely as possible.  It's also basically the same as a
standard technique used in computer graphics called "dithering".
