Subject: Conversion kits for old keyboards

From: Judith Conrad <jconrad@tiac.net>

I saw on rec.musicmakers.piano the other day that Story and Clark piano
company sells conversion kits for putting electronic innards into old junk
pianos. Anyone know anything about this? Are they tunable? I was once
given an 88-note  silent keyboard by a lady whose Steinway I was tuning;
her husband was a sea captain, and bought it for her so she could keep up
her technique on long voyages -- but he had died, and she no longer went
on voyages. It's been collecting dist in my basement ever since. I have
clavichords for when I want to play and not make noise!
