Subject: TUNING digest 887 Reply to Jon Szanto

From: Daniel Wolf <106232.3266@compuserve.com>

For the record: although I am a **real** _Californio_ (my grandfather*s
grandfather had a farm (!) in San Francisco in 1848), I was never the
'**California boy** that J. Szanto suggests. I can*t surf. I never inhaled.
And I never heard of the Hindustani Jazz Sextet. (Though I sometimes heard
Harihar Rao*s Indian Music program on KPFK).

I do know Emil Richards* book,  however. _Emil Richards* World of
Percussion** is interesting for a couple of Erv Wilson instruments, and
Richards had Harry Partch tune up a few of the instruments in his
collection. Perhaps a good Partch scholar should add these to the list.
(Along these lines, Mills College also has a Partch instrument, the _double
canon_, or prototype of the Surrogate Kithara, whose picture is found in
the first edition of _Genesis of a Music_. The dance music that this was
used for at Mills should also be added to the Partch works list. Perhaps,
there should be a prize created for anyone ever finding either (a) the
abandoned Guitar I or (b) one of the abandoned reed organs or (c) one of
the fugues Partch composed while in Hawaii.)
