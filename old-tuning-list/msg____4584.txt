It can, but commonly it's used as a method of amplifying the sound with
mechanical contact. I fix mine with a stick between the end of the board
and the top of the gourd. It makes a big difference in volume. If you use it
as an air resonator the difference is only small.
Other materials are used too. Sometimes mbiras are mounted on large gasoline
tins, or tortoise shells or even skulls are attached.
The association in Shona culture of the mbira and the gourd resonator is so
strong that they have an expression for "calabash resonator without mbira"
referring to someone who speaks with "empty words".
