Subject: Piano improvement

From: Manuel.Op.de.Coul@ezh.nl (Manuel Op de Coul)

I was reading a story about a piano that needs to be tuned less often.
An invention of pianotuner and trader Cornelis de Baat. He replaced
the wooden soundboard with one of thick glass. It doesn't contract
and expand with temperature changes so much like wood.
The piano sounds different and some people like the sound and others
don't. It turned out that people before him had requested similar
patents, using iron, aluminium or acryl. De Baat had a sleepless night
before he set the saw into a brandnew grand piano but the operation was
successful and the instrument sold. He's looking for an interested
manufacturer now.
