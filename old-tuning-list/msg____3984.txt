Subject: WWW and microtonality
--
Well, I just had my first experience surfing
the WWW for 4 hours straight at the local
library.
What a mess.
People...it's fifty times *worse* than I ever
imagined.
Here are the hard numbers:
Tried 6 search engines: Alta Vista, Yahoo,
HotBot,  Lycos, Magellan, Accufind. Searched for the word 
"microtonality."  Defaults only.
Worst result: 6 hits. (Accufind.) "Best" result: 168 hits
(HotBot).
Ah, but those 168 "hits" are deceptive, kiddlies...  
Of all those 168 "hits," exactly 4 URLs led to useful
websites: the Piet Oostrum's site, the JIN
Store, Zia's site, and the Mills microtonal discography/
bibliography.
Every other "hit" led either to wild garbage--
including some truly amazing wackiness about
"quantified astrological fields"--or irrelevant
fragments (someone somewhere thought it would
be a smart idea to spatter bits and pieces of 
microtonal CD reviews and miscellaneous e-mail
from the Mills tuning forum across the
web by turning them into hhtp links, and the
end result is positively hallucinogenic), or
dead "404 -- FILE NOT FOUND" messages. (Also
plenty of 403s, same difference.)
Artificial intelligence has never impressed
me, and 40 years of LISP code seems to have
produced a truly monogoloid spate of
WWW search engines, all of them deeply &
desperately & unspeakably *bad* at finding
anything in the way of useful info.
Plus, fraud. HotBot clearly ups its number of "hits"
by including all dead URLs in its list.  (Other
search engines appear to weed 'em out.) Thus,
while HotBot scored the largest number of
"hits" in a search for the word "microtonality,"
it does so at the cost of including vast
numbers of 404 URLs.  Roughly 25% of all the
HotBot hits were dead URLs.  Every link to
the Harry Partch Society 404'd, every link to
CERN 404'd.  Attempts to find the new URLs
failed in every case.  Gave up.
Even worse, *no* WWW search engine
turned up a basic list of elementary info
you'd want to find out if you were a micro-
tonalist just starting out:
Namely, what kind of non-12 tunings exist?
How is microtonal music being made?
Where is it being made?
What's the history of non-12 tuning?
Why is microtonal music being made?
This is truly impressive.  These are the BASIC
questions any microtonal beginner would ask,
and answers to 'em are *nowhere* available
on the web. 
--
So let's see what we've got here:
[1] The WWW is a swirling maelstrom
of junk littered with dumb-and-dumber
search engines and non-stop 404s.
About 98% of the search "hits" on the
word "microtonality" turned up pure 
garbage--essays by grad students about
burning pianos that happen to mention
the word "microtonality," random 
dissociated fragments of Mills Tuning
Forum e-mail someone pasted into the
web...last and best, innumerable LINK NOT FOUND
dead ends.
[2] None of this so-called "information" on
"microtonality" had much to do with
microtonality, with the exception of
Manuel Op de Coul's discography and the
Mills bibliography.  The typical
"hit" on an Alta Vista or Yahoo list was
something like "Post Modern Notation
And Its Implications For Tutti-Fruiti
Ice Cream" with the word "microtonal"
squirreled away somewhere in the body
of the text for snob appeal.
[3] There is no single web page anywhere,
at any time, in any way that offers any
kind of general introduction to microtonality
for the beginner.  There is also no single
web page anywhere that offers any kind
of *context* for people who know something
about microtonality and want to know more.
Ideally, we should have 3 levels of web
pages about microtonality: (1) BEGINNERS START
HERE.  (2) IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT
MICROTONALITY AND WANT TO KNOW MORE,
START HERE. (3) EXPERTS ONLY--ADVANCED
TOPICS IN MICROTONALITY.
In effect, there is zero useful information
available about microtonality on the web.
[4] Because most of the URLs blow out with
404s, it's incredibly frustrating--almost
*no one* seems to be bright enough to realize
that all URLs very quickly fry & die as
the Internet addressing scheme is changed
to accomodate the explosive growth of the
web....therefore, the most sensible thing
to do is assume the URLs are DOA and
include a snail mail address for each URL
(all of which will be 404 soon anyway).
--
So my worst nightmares turned out to be
*mild* in comparison with the truth.
I already knew the Internet was a chaotic
mess of bad info and gossip, but I'd assumed
there was at least *a little* smidgen of
useful information hidden away somewhere,
available to extremely persistent web surfers.
Silly me.
Turns out the WWW is a vast whirlwind of
junkthink, misinformation, snobtalk,  gossip,
rumors, fantasy and nonsense.  The web's
democratic, all right--just like the incurable
ward at Bellevue.
There's no context for anything, no way to
make sense of any information, no place for
beginners to start, no way to sort out garbage
misinformation from solid info.  Among other gems
I encountered an essay which discussed 
Thaddeus Cahill's trautonium (I like it!  Cahill
did *not* invent the trautonium, he invented
the telharmonium, a totally different instrument
from a totally different era).  Ah, but best of all:
I searched the WWW for the word "tuning" & got 20
websites about "tuning your server" but not *one*
*single* *website* about microtonality.
Impressive, eh? 
All told, the experience of surfing the web 
in quest of information about microtonality
was like being beaten by 12 dwarfs with baseball
bats underwater while blindfolded on LSD.
Utter, raving, wild chaos.  No way
to make sense of anything.  No context.  No place
to start.  No reliable info (except for Manuel's
web pages and few scraps of the Mills Tuning
Forum placed on the web but wayyyyyy out of
context and thus incomprehensible to anyone
likely to read 'em).
--
If I were a beginner looking for info on 
microtonality, what would I find by searching
the world wide web?
[1] Huge amounts of information about industrial
music, pomo music theory, computer music,
some mystifying references to a guy named
Harry Partch all of which lead to dead URLs
that give "404 -- file not found" messages.
Weird fragments about some guy named
Haverstick who made a CD, a couple of files
about how to tune your guitar *to 12-tet*,
and--best of all--plenty of references to
university music courses on 20th century
music, all of which mention microtonality
as something a couple of European guys did
back in the 1920s.
Riiiiiiiight.
This is good.
We're really doing well here, people.
If I were a beginner searching for info
on microtonalty...after surfing the web
for a couple three hours I'd run screaming
back to the 12-tet conservatory, where
at least *some* hard info on *something*
would be available.
--
Between all the hundreds of dead-end 404
URLs and the lengthy essays on "notational
implications of MIDI" (nary a mention of
microtonality) and the odd "quantified
astrological field" references (another
of my favorite "hits" from a search for
the word "microtonality"), if I were a
microtnal beginner searching the web,
after about 3 or 4 hours  I'd be ready 
for some heavy-duty electroconvulsive 
therapy.
Alas, one thing I would *NOT* be ready to
do after surfing the WWW in search of
useful info on microtonality, is:  contact 
*any* of the major
microtonal organizations (JIN,
Frog Peak, Artifact Records, Pointless
Music, ReR, BHPS, Xenharmonikon, 
ReR Quarterly, Boston Microtonal
Society, AFMM, etc.)
or be equipped to understand even the
most elementary basic fundamental
concepts of microtonality.
--
So it's one huge incredible mess out there.
Far worse than I ever imagined.  The web is
not "the nervous system of the human race,"
it's a giant dumpster full of out-of-date
astrology ads and ungrammatical essays. Not
only will beginners wind up baffled by 
their attempts to find info on microtonality,
but they'll probably get the impression
that [A] there *isn't* any useful info
on microtonality, it's just a chaotic
jumble of gibberish; [B] somebody named
Harry Partch did something in connection
with microtonality, but he's obviously not
worth bothering with because no info is
available about him; [C] contemporary
microtonality is mostly about pomo
music theory with a smattering of
industrial music, feedback guitar
techniques, and "post-classic" pop
music;  [D] the most important 
microtonalists in music history are:
Glenn Branca, the Velvet Underground,
Brian Eno and Gavin Bryars.
--
Wow.
What can I say?
Just...Wow.
--
Okay.  So here's this giant mess...what do we
do about it?
First: you people need to LEARN HOW TO DESIGN
A WEBSITE.
Let's start at the beginning.
All search engines seem to operate by chewing
on the cumulative text of a website and tallying
up the total number of times your search word
is mentioned.  The first 25 words or so of a website 
are typically digested into a tag line that serves
as the search listing.  So what is the most
important part of any website?
*THE FIRST 25 WORDS.*
Hello. 
Anyone there???
When you design your website you *must*
do the following:
[1] ALWAYS strip off mail header garbage
if it's a re-post linked to the WWW.  Otherwise
the listing will show up as incomprehensible
stuff like BDHJ110101-10112@#128999198.111
What the hell is that???
If you surfed to Alta Vista and your "hits"
were a bunch of listings like 
1. 8989283.292#9202002=JJKDBD
2.===!~~~*(988.2392983DJDJDM.DLLL
3.&**@_)WWJWJ/WWW9989.2929298@ZOB
would *you* bother to read these "hits"?
Of course you wouldn't, you can't even tell
what the hell is *in* these websites.
[2] BOIL DOWN THE ESSENCE OF YOUR WEBSITE
TO 25 WORDS OR LESS.  THEN START WITH THOSE
25 WORDS, pure and simple. I can't begin to 
count the number of websites whose Yahoo
or Alta Vista or HotBot listing started off
something like this: "Hi, Jo Blow Here, this
is my attempt at doing a website which...."
WRONG!!!
If the website is about microtonal notation
for traditional instruments,  here is
how your website should look:
<HEAD>MICROTONAL NOTATION </HEAD>
<P> <H1> for traditional acoustic instruments.</H1> 
<P>
This website contains the following
specific information: <P> <L1>
..
This website would show up on a Yahoo
search list as
1.  MICROTONAL NOTATION for traditional
instruments. This website contains the following....
and this is *exactly* the way you want it to
show up, because this tells a websurfing visitor
*precisely* what is in your website as
clearly and simply and succintly as possible.
--
Here is how NOT to design the same website:
<HEAD> (Big huge graphic that takes 5 minutes
to download and tells the websurfer nothing--
hey....how about a picture of me?  Yeah! That'll do!) </HEAD>
<H1> This is JOE BLOW'S WEBSITE designed
with PageMill version 3.01.  This web page
was last updated on (blah-blah woof-woof).
If you have any new information or corrections,
please e-mail (myaddress@swarb.gink.zoid)
</H1>
<P> Fancy interactive JAVA program 
<P> Dead URL
<P> This web page is a first stab at an
attempt to describe a meta-theory involving
certain aspects of microtonal notation
which...
--
This would show up in a Yahoo or Alta Vista
or HotBot search list as:
"This is JOE BLOW'S WEBSITE designed
with PageMill version 3.01.  This web page
was last updated on (blah-blah woof-woof).
If you have any new information or corrections,
please e-mail (myaddress@swarb.gink.zoid)"
--
Guess what?  
It's impossible to tell what  this web page
is *about* by looking at the Yahoo listing.
Good job!
--
Second important point:  
When you design a web page, *forget* about
fancy graphics.  After a half hour of websurfing
I learned the hard way that Netscape downloads
text first--then goes back to fill in graphics.
So as soon as the text fills in I learned to
click on STOP.  This kills the graphics
downloads and lets me scroll through
the body of the webpage to see if there's
any useful content there (usually not).
The alternative is to sit around for 10
minutes reading Aristotle's "Rhetoric"
(my constant companion) while a useless
picture of something or someone creeps across 
the screen like a mailman with Parkinson's.
Here's a hint, people:
Graphics are garbage.  They're content-free.
Sound files are garbage.  They take wayyyyy
too long to download, last only a few seconds,
are wayyyyy too low-fi, and most computers
won't be set up to play 'em anyway.
JAVA programs never run.  DEC is always
upgrading JAVA, so the bottom line is that 
all JAVA interpreters are beta (if not alpha) 
code and they all crash and burn, no exception.  
--
So the second thing you need to know when
you folks design web pages is: leave out
the graphics, don't bother with sound files,
forget about fancy interactive animations,
kiss off the JAVA programs.  
As a websurfer I want one thing and one
thing only: content.  Also content.  And
by the way, did I mention content? 
That means text, text, more text, and even
*more* text.  It means BE CONCISE.  It
means TELL 'EM WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL
'EM, TELL 'EM, THEN TELL 'EM WHAT YOU TOLD
'EM.
AT* fill the damn background
of your web pages with fancy patterns.  This
makes the web page *unreadable.*
Also, please do *NOT* do something tricky
like making your text fluorescent green
against a picture of a black starry sky
scanned from a Hubble satellite photo.
Any sensible user will click on STOP long
before the background graphic downloads...
Which leaves the hapless reader with unreadable 
fluorescent green text against a gray background.  
Ai caramba!

Here are 3 horrible examples of what
I'm talking about:
[1] "<H1> Two CD reviews </H1>
DMB5561719@aol.com<P>
Sat, 1 Apr 95 17:49:18-0800<P>
<L1>Message sorted by [date][thread][subject]
[author]
<L1> Next messages John H. Chalmers: "Another
post from McLaren" <P>
<L1>Previous message: John H. Chalmers "Post
from Brian"<P1>
<L1>
In tuning digest I never see enough reviews
of microtonal rcordsings.  Here is my
contribution, a few things I haven't seen
anywhere else.
(etc.)
--
That was the verbatim text of the start of an
actual web page.
First, look at the uninformative header:
"Two CD reviews."  What KIND of CDs? 
Second: look at all the header junk.  Who
cares about the internet adress, who cares
about the date?  Post that crud--if you have
to--at the *end* of the website, *not*
the first couple of lines.
Third: look at all the garbage!  "Messages
sorted by..."  "Next message..."  "Previous
message..."  Totally content-free!
And even in the body of the website
we get vaguely worded mush that tells
the average person nothing: "In tuning
digest I never see enough reviews of 
microtona recordings.  Here is my
contribution, a few things I haven't..."
yadda-yadda-yadda. 
Imagine it--10 lines of text, and the
web surfer *still* doesn't have the
faintest idea WHAT THE HELL THIS
WEB PAGE IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT.
--
Horrible example 2: check out Zusaan
Kali Fasteau's web page.  She's a fine
performer, an innovative microtonalist,
etc., etc., okay, fine, she's peachy-keen
'n dandy, love her music, she's the 
greatest thing since squeezed cheese.
Fine.
But the very first thing on her web
page is a *monster* graphic that takes 
10 minutes to download.
I clicked STOP, dumped the graphic,
aborted the web page and scooted.
ZKF offers a perfect example of how *not*
to design a web page.
CONTENT FIRST, and superfluous glitz
later (if at all).  Put your graphics at
 the *end* of the web page, if you must
include them at all.  And as for scanned
photos of yourselves--people, I hate to
let you in on a little secret here, but
nobody cares what you look like.  "On
the Internet, no one knows you're a dog"
as the cartoon goes.
Content is what matters on the web.
Pure distilled info.  Everything else
is piffle. 
--
Third horrible example:
Wendy Carlos put up a web page with a
mail box.  Never got around to reading it.
Wendy is a genius, a wonderful person,
a superb musician, yadda-yadda-yadda.
But her web site is a *disaster.*
The background is some textured Mayan
hieroglyphic something-or-other, and
it is just plain *impossible* to make
out black text against it.
At first, I thought I had eye trouble.
--
Here's the bottom line:
Dark black text against a light
uniform background is highly readable.
Anything else is probably UNreadable.
Stick to *dark black text* against a 
*light uniform background.*
--
Okay.  That takes care of basics.  Common
sense should have told you all of this,
but apparently these revelations come
as a startling epiphany to those of you who 
design web pages.
This leaves the issue of content.
Clearly none of you are capable of putting
together a concise comprehensive web
page that introduces beginners to the
fundamental elmentary terms and ideas
of microtonality. 
Clearly none of you are able or willing
to design a web page that gives oodles 'n
oodles of snail mail addresses of
places like the JIN and the British
Harry Partch Society and Frog Peak
and ReR and Pointless Music and 
the Electronic Music Foundation.
Clearly none of you other than Manuel
are able or willing to design a web page
that contains titles of basic essential
references like Mandelbaum's thesis,
Partch's Genesis of a Music, Blackwood's
Structure of Recognizable Diatonic
Tunings, Darreg's Xenharmonic Bulletins,
Bosanquet's book, and the Corpus Microtonale
score library, and the addresses at which
to get these documents. (Snail mail--remember,
all URLs go 404 within a couple of months
nowadays.)
--
So, obviously, as usual, I'll have to do it. 
Amazing.  Just amazing.  You people have
got enough collective brainpower and knowledge
about microtonality to move Mars out of its
orbit, and after 3 years you *still* haven't put
even a single  minimally  adequate microtonal 
web page anywhere in the world where beginners
can find basic necessary info on microtonality.
What's that?
Oh.  Sorry.
Did I wake you folks up?
Never mind, go back to sleep.  It's nothing.
