Subject: harpsichords, horns, etc.

From: "Christopher Smith" <petalsinpetaluma@hotmail.com>

1.) I'm currently contemplating a chamber piece with retuned harpsichord 
in just intonation. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions?
Any just harpsichord CDs available? (I'm planning on tuning the two 
manuals differently, for 24 total pitches - haven't settled on the 
tuning yet.) I know of one - a disc of Scelsi and Zender on cpo which
includes a chamber cantata by Zender with just hpscd. Unfortunately, it 
was stolen (!) so I don't have morte info.

2.) A CD came out a few years ago of Charles Koechlin's horn music
played by Barry Tuckwell. It includes a number of implicitly 13-limit
pieces for multiple natural horns - quite a surprise when I first 
bought it! Has anyone tried writing for multiple natural horns in 
different keys?

3.) I've made simple PVC notch flutes in the 8-10-foot-long-range. I can 
get to the 23rd or 24th harmonic fairly easily, but have some problems 
with response and agility. Any feedback regarding notch
design, material, etc.?
