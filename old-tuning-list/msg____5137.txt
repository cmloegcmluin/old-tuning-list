Subject: proof is needed

From: Aline Surman <stick@dnvr.uswest.net>

Morrison's response to Marcus's comments was a hoot; when Hobbs pointed 
out that there were deeper forces working on us from the cosmos, Gary 
said that Sagan's response would probably be to ask him to identify the 
forces. Well, I would surely say death is one of those forces. I'm pretty 
sure "science" doesn't have a clue just yet as to how to explain what's
going on there. Death comes for all, and we know not when, or how it will 
occur...absolutely natural, and out of our control.

Again, the Universe is very integrated in all of it's component parts; 
only man has tried to fragment it into math, religion, etc. We are the 
CREATED ones; best not to forget that fact. We woke up in this marvelous 
Universe one day, and have been trying to understand it ever since. My 
study of tunings is really a study of sound and it's power. This concept 
is more basic and primal than the concept of tunings. Tunings only serve 
to demonstrate different aspects of sound, and the infinity of 
possibilities thereof. But, common to all tuning systems is the fact that 
they are sounds first. And again, it's important to realize that there 
are gazillions of frequencies bouncing around from all over the 
Universe; it matters little that we can "see" or "hear" them, in 
conventional terms; perhaps, as MANY ancient cultures have suggested, 
there are other ways to see and hear. Astrology, as with many sort of 
"mystical" ideas in our society, is turning into a sort of pop topic for 
tabloids, rather than a serious inquiry into the forces around us; don't 
throw the baby out with the bath, and use astrolgy to mock true 
knowledge.

One last comment...there was recently a discharge of energy from the Sun, 
which actually knocked out a satellite. If it did that to a satellite, 
would it not be reasonable to infer that these same energies also passed 
through OUR bodies as well? Is it possible, since we were created by the 
Sun some time ago, that these energies had some sort of effect on our 
very being? Could this be the link between mysticism and science? Where 
is Carl Sagan now, anyway?...maybe somebody on the forum will channel him 
for us...Hstick
