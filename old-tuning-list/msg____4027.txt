do any of you remember brian's post regarding the FFT, back in tuning digest
544?  it was one of the high points of his brilliance.  whenever he gets a
little too wild for my taste, i go back to reread that article.  it makes up
for his current topics.

i'd like to ask brian, "brian, can you tell me if you'll ever focus your mental
powers on a relevant xenharmonic/audio/mathematical topic as brilliantly as you
did in tuning digest 544?  because when you do, your words bring my mind up a
level".  too bad he doesn't have an email address.
