From: linusliu@hk.super.net (Linus Liu)

The answer to this is so simple. My daughter does not care about what
tuning the piano is. Usually, my piano is not very well tuned anyway.
When my daughter was very small (from one week old), I would sing along
with any tempered instrument, flute, piano, organ, so that she understands
that those are "substitution" for the correct intonation.

This phenomenon appears in many circumstances. When I was a not-so-in-tune
violinist, I myself cannot hear myself out of tune the when I was playing.
But if I put myself on tape, and listen to the tape afterwards, I can tell
thousands of notes out of tune. The reason is I practiced badly too many
times.

Some post just revealed (was it Gary?) that violinist who claim to play
tempered in fact does not do anywhere close to tempered. So how come
so many of you, and others still believe so much that violinist try to
imitate the intonation of the accompanying instruments? So any of you
tell any difference between the violinist and the accompaniment even
once before? So did it strike you that it sounded SO bad?

A friend once brought a piano professor from the Mountpellier Conservatory
to my house. We played from afternoon till midnight. After a few years, 
he came and we played again. I told him that every note I play except 
the A is different from the piano. He could not believe me, and went
on checking each and every note of a sonata. He was so surprised that
it really was. So nobody cares what the tuning is when there is nothing 
to care about.

Neither could you noticed that pianists and violinist write music
very differently, and their use different harmony rules, because 
their tunings are different!

Linus Liu.
